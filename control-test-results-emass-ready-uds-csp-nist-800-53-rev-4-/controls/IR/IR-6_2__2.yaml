  Description:

  The organization reports information system vulnerabilities associated with
  reported security incidents to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
  roles].


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when

  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident reporting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; personnel to whom
  vulnerabilities associated with security incidents are to be reported].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for incident reporting; automated
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing reporting of vulnerabilities
  associated with security incidents].
