  Description:

  The organization provides incident response training to information system
  users consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities:

  a. Within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of assuming an
  incident response role or responsibility;

  b. When required by information system changes; and

  c. [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] thereafter.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Incident response training provided by organizations is linked to the assigned
  roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure the
  appropriate content and level of detail is included in such training. For
  example, regular users may only need to know who to call or how to recognize
  an incident on the information system; system administrators may require
  additional training on how to handle/remediate incidents; and incident
  responders may receive more specific training on forensics, reporting, system
  recovery, and restoration. Incident response training includes user training
  in the identification and reporting of suspicious activities, both from
  external and internal sources. Related controls: AT-3, CP-3, IR-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  training and operational responsibilities; organizational personnel with

  002779: The organization provides incident response training to information
  system users consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities when required
  by information system changes.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to provide incident response training to information system users, other than
  general users, consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities when
  required by information system changes. For general users, DoD components are
  automatically compliant with the requirement based on DoDD 8570.01
  requirements for IA awareness training. The organization must maintain a
  record of training.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Automatically compliant for general users

  2.) Document with process and training records for other than general users,
  consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented process as well as training records for a sampling of information
  system users to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed provides
  incident response training to information system users, other than general
  users, consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities when required by
  information system changes. For general users, DoD components are
  automatically compliant with the requirement based on DoDD 8570.01
  requirements for IA awareness training.
