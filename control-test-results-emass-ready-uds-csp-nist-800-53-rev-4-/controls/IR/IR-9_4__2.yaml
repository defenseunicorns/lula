  Description:

  The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined security
  safeguards] for personnel exposed to information not within assigned access
  authorizations.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Security safeguards include, for example, making personnel exposed to spilled
  information aware of the federal laws, directives, policies, and/or
  regulations regarding the information and the restrictions imposed based on
  exposure to such information.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident handling; procedures addressing information spillage; incident
  response plan; security safeguards regarding information spillage/exposure to
  unauthorized personnel; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident response
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for dealing with information
  exposed to unauthorized personnel; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing safeguards for personnel exposed to information not within
  assigned access authorizations].

  002821: The organization defines security safeguards to employ for personnel
  exposed to information not within assigned access authorizations.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents security
  safeguards to employ for personnel exposed to information not within assigned
  access authorizations. DoD has determined the security safeguards are not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation that defines security safeguards to employ for personnel
  exposed to information not within assigned access authorizations.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented security safeguards to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed defines security safeguards to employ for personnel exposed
  to information not within assigned access authorizations. DoD has determined
  the security safeguards are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
