  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles]:

  1. An incident response policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
  responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational
  entities, and compliance; and

  2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the incident response policy
  and associated incident response controls; and

  b. Reviews and updates the current:

  1. Incident response policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and

  2. Incident response procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
  effective implementation of selected security controls and control
  enhancements in the IR family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable
  federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
  and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization
  level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures
  unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information
  security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by
  multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The
  procedures can be established for the security program in general and for
  particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
  strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related
  control: PM-9.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  documents or records].

  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].

  DoD (in conjunction with Joint Staff for CJCSIs) reviews and updates current
  incident response procedures (CJCSI 6510.01F, CJCSM 6510.01B, DoDD O-8530.1,
  and DoDI O-8530.2) annually. DoD Components are automatically compliant with
  this CCI because they are covered at the DoD level with the following
  policies: CJCSI 6510.01F, CJCSM 6510.01B, DoDD O-8530.1, and DoDI O-8530.2.
  DoD has defined the frequency as reviewed annually - updated as appropriate.
