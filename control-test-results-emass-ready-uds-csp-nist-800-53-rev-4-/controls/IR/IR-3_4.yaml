control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization tests the incident response capability for the information
  system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] using [Assignment:
  organization-defined tests] to determine the incident response effectiveness
  and documents the results.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations test incident response capabilities to determine the overall
  effectiveness of the capabilities and to identify potential weaknesses or
  deficiencies. Incident response testing includes, for example, the use of
  checklists, walk-through or tabletop exercises, simulations (parallel/full
  interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. Incident response testing can also
  include a determination of the effects on organizational operations (e.g.,
  reduction in mission capabilities), organizational assets, and individuals due
  to incident response. Related controls: CP-4, IR-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  procedures addressing incident response testing; procedures addressing
  contingency plan testing; incident response testing material; incident
  response test results; incident response test plan; incident response plan;

  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident response
  testing responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].

  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines:

  1. the organization's incident response plan to identify organization's
  testing schedule and, 2. results of previous incident response tests to ensure
  the organization is documenting the results IAW their incident response plan.
