  Description:

  The organization identifies [Assignment: organization-defined classes of
  incidents] and [Assignment: organization-defined actions to take in response
  to classes of incidents] to ensure continuation of organizational missions and
  business functions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Classes of incidents include, for example, malfunctions due to
  design/implementation errors and omissions, targeted malicious attacks, and
  untargeted malicious attacks. Appropriate incident response actions include,
  for example, graceful degradation, information system shutdown, fall back to
  manual mode/alternative technology whereby the system operates differently,
  employing deceptive measures, alternate information flows, or operating in a
  mode that is reserved solely for when systems are under attack.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident handling; incident response plan; security plan; list of classes of
  incidents; list of appropriate incident response actions; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident handling
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms that support and/or implement
  continuity of operations].

  000828: The organization defines and identifies actions to take in response to
  organization-defined classes of incidents to ensure continuation of
  organizational missions and business functions.
implementation-guidance: >-
  CJCSM 6510.01B has already identified DoD's actions to take in response to
  classes of incidents.


  DoD Components are automatically compliant with this CCI because DoD has
  defined the actions as actions defined in CJCSM 6510.01B.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically compliant per CJCSM 6510.01B
assessment-procedures: >-
  CJCSM 6510.01B has already identified DoD's actions to take in response to
  classes of incidents. The organization being inspected/assessed is
  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the actions as actions defined in CJCSM 6510.01B.
