  Description:

  The organization tests the incident response capability for the information
  system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] using [Assignment:
  organization-defined tests] to determine the incident response effectiveness
  and documents the results.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations test incident response capabilities to determine the overall
  effectiveness of the capabilities and to identify potential weaknesses or
  deficiencies. Incident response testing includes, for example, the use of
  checklists, walk-through or tabletop exercises, simulations (parallel/full
  interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. Incident response testing can also
  include a determination of the effects on organizational operations (e.g.,
  reduction in mission capabilities), organizational assets, and individuals due
  to incident response. Related controls: CP-4, IR-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  000818: The organization tests the incident response capability for the
  information system on an organization-defined frequency using
  organization-defined tests to determine the incident response effectiveness.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to test its incident response capability for the information system at least
  every six months for high availability and at least annually for low/med
  availability using tests and as defined in the incident response plan. The
  organization must maintain a record of test results. DoD has defined the
  frequency as at least every six months for high availability and at least
  annually for low/med availability. DoD has defined the tests as tests as
  defined in the incident response plan.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Incident Response Test and/or after action reports
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented process as well as the record of test results to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed tests its incident response capability
  for the information system at least every six months for high availability and
  at least annually for low/med availability using tests and as defined in the
  incident response plan. DoD has defined the frequency as at least every six
  months for high availability and at least annually for low/med availability.
  DoD has defined the tests as tests as defined in the incident response plan.
