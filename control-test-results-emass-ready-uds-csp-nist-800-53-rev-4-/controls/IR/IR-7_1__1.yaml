control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs automated mechanisms to increase the availability of
  incident response-related information and support.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Automated mechanisms can provide a push and/or pull capability for users to
  obtain incident response assistance. For example, individuals might have
  access to a website to query the assistance capability, or conversely, the
  assistance capability may have the ability to proactively send information to
  users (general distribution or targeted) as part of increasing understanding
  of current response capabilities and support.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident response assistance; automated mechanisms supporting incident
  response support and assistance; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  incident response plan; security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident response
  support and assistance responsibilities; organizational personnel with access
  to incident response support and assistance capability; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for incident response assistance;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing an increase in the
  availability of incident response information and support].

  000840: The organization employs automated mechanisms to increase the
  availability of incident response-related information and support.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will implement an automated
  intra-organization incident response information sharing capability to provide
  the following incident related information and support, for example:

  1. SOP for incident reporting

  2. Incident handling FAQ

  3. Current incident activity awareness information

  4. Incident response contact information

  5. Incident report submission


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Incident Response Plan, referencing automated mechanisms
  section
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  incident response information sharing capability to validate the information
  sharing capability is available to organizational users.
