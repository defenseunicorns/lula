  Description:

  The organization implements an insider threat program that includes a
  cross-discipline insider threat incident handling team.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations handling classified information are required, under Executive
  Order 13587 and the National Policy on Insider Threat, to establish insider
  threat programs. The standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat
  programs in classified environments can also be employed effectively to
  improve the security of Controlled Unclassified Information in non-national
  security systems. Insider threat programs include security controls to detect
  and prevent malicious insider activity through the centralized integration and
  analysis of both technical and non-technical information to identify potential
  insider threat concerns. A senior organizational official is designated by the
  department/agency head as the responsible individual to implement and provide
  oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized integration and
  analysis capability, insider threat programs as a minimum, prepare
  department/agency insider threat policies and implementation plans, conduct
  host-based user monitoring of individual employee activities on
  government-owned classified computers, provide insider threat awareness
  training to employees, receive access to information from all offices within
  the department/agency (e.g., human resources, legal, physical security,
  personnel security, information technology, information system security, and
  law enforcement) for insider threat analysis, and conduct self-assessments of
  department/agency insider threat posture.
   Insider threat programs can leverage the existence of incident handling teams organizations may already have in place, such as computer security incident response teams. Human resources records are especially important in this effort, as there is compelling evidence to show that some types of insider crimes are often preceded by nontechnical behaviors in the workplace (e.g., ongoing patterns of disgruntled behavior and conflicts with coworkers and other colleagues). These precursors can better inform and guide organizational officials in more focused, targeted monitoring efforts. The participation of a legal team is important to ensure that all monitoring activities are performed in accordance with appropriate legislation, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; insider threat
  program documentation; procedures for the insider threat program; risk
  assessment results relevant to insider threats; list or other documentation on
  the cross-discipline insider threat incident handling team; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  program planning and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational
  personnel responsible for the insider threat program; members of the
  cross-discipline insider threat incident handling team; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for implementing the insider
  threat program and the cross-discipline insider threat incident handling team;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the insider threat program
  and the cross-discipline insider threat incident handling team].

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The Program Management (PM) family of
  controls primarily focuses on high-level organizational security governance,
  including policies, risk management strategies, and enterprise-wide planning.
  These controls are typically addressed at the organizational level rather than
  by a specific technology platform like UDS.)
