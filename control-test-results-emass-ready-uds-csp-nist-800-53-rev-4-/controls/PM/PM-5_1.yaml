  Description:

  The organization develops and maintains an inventory of its information
  systems.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control addresses the inventory requirements in FISMA. OMB provides
  guidance on developing information systems inventories and associated
  reporting requirements. For specific information system inventory reporting
  requirements, organizations consult OMB annual FISMA reporting guidance.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; information system
  inventory; procedures addressing information system inventory development and
  maintenance; OMB FISMA reporting guidance; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  program planning and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational
  personnel responsible for developing and maintaining the information system
  inventory; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for information system inventory
  development and maintenance; automated mechanisms supporting the information
  system inventory].

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The Program Management (PM) family of
  controls primarily focuses on high-level organizational security governance,
  including policies, risk management strategies, and enterprise-wide planning.
  These controls are typically addressed at the organizational level rather than
  by a specific technology platform like UDS.)
