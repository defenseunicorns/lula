  Description:

  The information system protects the authenticity of communications sessions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control addresses communications protection at the session, versus packet
  level (e.g., sessions in service-oriented architectures providing web-based
  services) and establishes grounds for confidence at both ends of
  communications sessions in ongoing identities of other parties and in the
  validity of information transmitted. Authenticity protection includes, for
  example, protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks/session hijacking and
  the insertion of false information into sessions. Related controls: SC-8,
  SC-10, SC-11.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing session authenticity; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  session authenticity].

  001184: The information system protects the authenticity of communications
  sessions.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  protect the authenticity of communications sessions. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  1184.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks pertaining to CCI 1184.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to protect the authenticity of communications sessions. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 1184.

test-results: "UDS enables session authenticity through use of cryptographically strong session tokens and handshakes. When a user authenticates, Keycloak issues a JWT access token. This token is digitally signed by Keycloak and embedded with the userâ\x80\x99s identity and claims. Services within UDS (via Authservice/Istio) validate this token on each request. Because the token is signed and has a limited lifetime, it cannot be forged or reused illegitimately ensuring the session is indeed tied to that user and is authenticâ\x80\x8B. Service sessions use Mutual TLS between services which ensures each connection is not only encrypted but the endpoints are verified by certs. So any persistent session or connection between microservices is guaranteed to be with the genuine intended service, not an impostor. If a session token is tampered with, the signature check will fail and the request is rejected. In essence, UDSâ\x80\x99s use of strong identity tokens and certificates upholds session authenticity."
