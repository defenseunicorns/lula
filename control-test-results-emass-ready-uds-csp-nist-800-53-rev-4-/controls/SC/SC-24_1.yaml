  Description:

  The information system fails to a [Assignment: organization-defined
  known-state] for [Assignment: organization-defined types of failures]
  preserving [Assignment: organization-defined system state information] in
  failure.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Failure in a known state addresses security concerns in accordance with the
  mission/business needs of organizations. Failure in a known secure state helps
  to prevent the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of
  information in the event of failures of organizational information systems or
  system components. Failure in a known safe state helps to prevent systems from
  failing to a state that may cause injury to individuals or destruction to
  property. Preserving information system state information facilitates system
  restart and return to the operational mode of organizations with less
  disruption of mission/business processes. Related controls: CP-2, CP-10,
  CP-12, SC-7, SC-22.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing information system failure to known state; information system
  design documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; list of failures requiring information system to fail in a
  known state; state information to be preserved in system failure; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  fail-in-known state capability; automated mechanisms preserving system state
  information in the event of a system failure].

  001190: Fail to an organization-defined known-system state for the following
  failures on the indicated components while preserving organization-defined
  system state information in failure.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  fail to a secure state for failures during system initialization, shutdown,
  and aborts. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG
  guidance that pertains to CCI 1190. DoD has defined the known state as secure
  state. DoD has defined the types of failures as failures during system
  initialization, shutdown, and aborts.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Test plans and procedures which describe when and how the site test the
  information system for failure to a secure state during system initialization,
  shutdown, and aborts.

  2.) Disaster recovery plan (reference 'test procedures' section).

  3. Applicable STIGS/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 1190.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to fail to a secure state for failures during system
  initialization, shutdown, and aborts. For information system components that
  have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 1190. DoD has defined the
  known state as secure state. DoD has defined the types of failures as failures
  during system initialization, shutdown, and aborts.

  UDS architecture ensures that in the event of system failures, components fail
  predictably into an organization-defined known secure state while preserving
  essential state information. Kubernetes inherently manages containerized
  components, automatically restarting or reverting failed applications to a
  stable, defined state using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with OpenTofu and
  Zarf deployment packages. The Istio Service Mesh further enforces fail-safe
  configurations, defaulting to denying traffic or blocking requests if the
  control plane or communication channels become compromised. Keycloak and other
  critical components generate audit and session logs that persist through
  failure scenarios, preserving essential state information for forensic
  analysis or recovery. The integration of Velero ensures regular backups of
  cluster states and data, enabling reliable restoration to a documented and
  secure baseline following any significant disruption. Together, these
  capabilities provide robust mechanisms for system recovery, ensuring that
  failures consistently lead to secure, predictable outcomes aligned with
  organizational requirements.
