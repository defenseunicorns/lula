  Description:

  The information system protects the [Selection (one or more): confidentiality;
  integrity] of [Assignment: organization-defined information at rest].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control addresses the confidentiality and integrity of information at
  rest and covers user information and system information. Information at rest
  refers to the state of information when it is located on storage devices as
  specific components of information systems. System-related information
  requiring protection includes, for example, configurations or rule sets for
  firewalls, gateways, intrusion detection/prevention systems, filtering
  routers, and authenticator content. Organizations may employ different
  mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, including the
  use of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Integrity protection
  can be achieved, for example, by implementing Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM)
  technologies. Organizations may also employ other security controls including,
  for example, secure off-line storage in lieu of online storage when adequate
  protection of information at rest cannot otherwise be achieved and/or
  continuous monitoring to identify malicious code at rest. Related controls:
  AC-3, AC-6, CA-7, CM-3, CM-5, CM-6, PE-3, SC-8, SC-13, SI-3, SI-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing protection of information at rest; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; cryptographic mechanisms and associated configuration
  documentation; list of information at rest requiring confidentiality and
  integrity protections; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  confidentiality and integrity protections for information at rest].

  002472: The organization defines the information at rest that is to be
  protected by the information system.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the
  information at rest that is to be protected by the information system which
  must include, at a minimum, PII and classified information. DoD has determined
  the information at rest is not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System Security Plan (SSP) should define the information
  at rest that is to be protected by the information system.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented information at rest to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed defines and documents the information at rest that is to be
  protected by the information system which must include, at a minimum, PII and
  classified information. DoD has determined the information at rest is not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS encrypts all data at rest within
  the platform but the organization must still define according to their needs
  or requirements.)
