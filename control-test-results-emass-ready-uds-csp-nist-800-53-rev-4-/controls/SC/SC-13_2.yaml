  Description:

  The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined
  cryptographic uses and type of cryptography required for each use] in
  accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
  policies, regulations, and standards.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Cryptography can be employed to support a variety of security solutions
  including, for example, the protection of classified and Controlled
  Unclassified Information, the provision of digital signatures, and the
  enforcement of information separation when authorized individuals have the
  necessary clearances for such information but lack the necessary formal access
  approvals. Cryptography can also be used to support random number generation
  and hash generation. Generally applicable cryptographic standards include
  FIPS-validated cryptography and NSA-approved cryptography. This control does
  not impose any requirements on organizations to use cryptography. However, if
  cryptography is required based on the selection of other security controls,
  organizations define each type of cryptographic use and the type of
  cryptography required (e.g., protection of classified information:
  NSA-approved cryptography; provision of digital signatures: FIPS-validated
  cryptography). Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-7, AC-17, AC-18, AU-9, AU-10,
  CM-11, CP-9, IA-3, IA-7, MA-4, MP-2, MP-4, MP-5, SA-4, SC-8, SC-12, SC-28,
  SI-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing cryptographic protection; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  cryptographic module validation certificates; list of FIPS validated
  cryptographic modules; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with responsibilities for cryptographic protection].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  cryptographic protection].

  002450: The information system implements organization-defined cryptographic
  uses and type of cryptography required for each use in accordance with
  applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
  and standards.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  implement, for, protection of classified information: NSA-approved
  cryptography; for provision of digital signatures and hashing: FIPS-validated
  cryptography in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,
  directives, policies, regulations, and standards. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  2450. DoD has defined the cryptographic uses and type of cryptography required
  for each use as protection of classified information: NSA-approved
  cryptography; provision of digital signatures and hashing: FIPS-validated
  cryptography.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System protection policy.

  2.) Communications protection policy.

  3.) System security plan (SSP) (reference encryption section).

  4.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks pertaining to CCI 2450.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to implement, for, protection of classified information:
  NSA-approved cryptography; for provision of digital signatures and hashing:
  FIPS-validated cryptography in accordance with applicable federal laws,
  Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 2450. DoD has defined the cryptographic uses and type of cryptography
  required for each use as protection of classified information: NSA-approved
  cryptography; provision of digital signatures and hashing: FIPS-validated
  cryptography.

test-results: "UDS employs federally approved cryptographic algorithms and protocols to protect information. It uses TLS (which can be configured to use FIPS 140-2 validated libraries and strong ciphers) for all encryption needs. Data encryption at rest would rely on AES-256 or similar, consistent with standards. UDSâ\x80\x99s emphasis on FIPS complianceâ\x80\x8B means it is designed to use approved crypto. For example, mutual TLS between services uses strong certificates and ciphers; Keycloakâ\x80\x99s token signing uses RSA or ECDSA with appropriate key lengths. By using these standard, vetted cryptographic techniques for both data in transit and at rest."
