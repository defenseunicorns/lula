  Description:

  The organization isolates [Assignment: organization-defined information
  security tools, mechanisms, and support components] from other internal
  information system components by implementing physically separate subnetworks
  with managed interfaces to other components of the system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces are useful, for
  example, in isolating computer network defenses from critical operational
  processing networks to prevent adversaries from discovering the analysis and
  forensics techniques of organizations. Related controls: SA-8, SC-2, SC-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; information system design documentation;
  information system hardware and software; information system architecture;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation; list
  of security tools and support components to be isolated from other internal
  information system components; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  isolation of information security tools, mechanisms, and support components].

  DoD has defined the key information security tools, mechanisms, and support
  components as key information security tools, mechanisms, and support
  components such as, but not limited to PKI, Patching infrastructure, HBSS, CND

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically compliant.
