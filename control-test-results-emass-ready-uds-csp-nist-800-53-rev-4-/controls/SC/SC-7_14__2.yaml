  Description:

  The organization protects against unauthorized physical connections at
  [Assignment: organization-defined managed interfaces].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information systems operating at different security categories or
  classification levels may share common physical and environmental controls,
  since the systems may share space within organizational facilities. In
  practice, it is possible that these separate information systems may share
  common equipment rooms, wiring closets, and cable distribution paths.
  Protection against unauthorized physical connections can be achieved, for
  example, by employing clearly identified and physically separated cable trays,
  connection frames, and patch panels for each side of managed interfaces with
  physical access controls enforcing limited authorized access to these items.
  Related controls: PE-4, PE-19.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; information system design documentation;
  information system hardware and software; information system architecture;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  facility communications and wiring diagram; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  protection against unauthorized physical connections].

  001122: The organization defines the managed interfaces where boundary
  protections against unauthorized physical connections are to be implemented.

  DoD has defined the managed interfaces as internet access points, enclave LAN
  to WAN, cross domain solutions, and any DoD Approved Alternate Gateways.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically compliant.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed is automatically compliant with this
  CCI because they are covered at the DoD level. DoD has defined the managed
  interfaces as internet access points, enclave LAN to WAN, cross domain
  solutions, and any DoD Approved Alternate Gateways.
