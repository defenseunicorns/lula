  Description:

  The organization protects against unauthorized physical connections at
  [Assignment: organization-defined managed interfaces].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information systems operating at different security categories or
  classification levels may share common physical and environmental controls,
  since the systems may share space within organizational facilities. In
  practice, it is possible that these separate information systems may share
  common equipment rooms, wiring closets, and cable distribution paths.
  Protection against unauthorized physical connections can be achieved, for
  example, by employing clearly identified and physically separated cable trays,
  connection frames, and patch panels for each side of managed interfaces with
  physical access controls enforcing limited authorized access to these items.
  Related controls: PE-4, PE-19.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; information system design documentation;
  information system hardware and software; information system architecture;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  facility communications and wiring diagram; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  protection against unauthorized physical connections].

  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements mechanisms
  to protect against unauthorized physical connections at internet access
  points, enclave LAN to WAN, cross domain solutions, and any DoD Approved
  Alternate Gateways. DoD has defined the managed interfaces as internet access
  points, enclave LAN to WAN, cross domain solutions, and any DoD Approved
  Alternate Gateways.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation that describes a mechanisms to ensure the
  organization protects against unauthorized physical connections at internet
  access points, enclave LAN to WAN, cross domain solutions, and any DoD
  Approved Alternate Gateways.

  2.) Network diagram.

  3.) Applicable firewall rule set.

  4.) Applicable firewall logs.

test-results: >-
  In UDS, while the platform is primarily container-based and deployed in
  virtualized environments, protection against unauthorized physical connections
  is achieved by leveraging the security controls of the underlying
  infrastructure. Managed interfaces such as those for Kubernetes, Istio
  ingress/egress, and host nodes deployed on physically isolated or logically
  segmented subnetworks, where physical access is strictly controlled by data
  center or cloud provider policies. The use of Infrastructure as Code via
  OpenTofu and secure deployment packaging with Zarf ensures that these network
  interfaces are consistently configured in environments with hardened physical
  and network security measures (e.g., firewalls and access control lists),
  thereby minimizing the risk of unauthorized physical connections.
