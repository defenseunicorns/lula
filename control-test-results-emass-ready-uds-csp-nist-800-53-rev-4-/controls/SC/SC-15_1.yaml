family: SC
control-acronym: SC-15
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system:

  a. Prohibits remote activation of collaborative computing devices with the
  following exceptions: [Assignment: organization-defined exceptions where
  remote activation is to be allowed]; and

  b. Provides an explicit indication of use to users physically present at the
  devices.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Collaborative computing devices include, for example, networked white boards,
  cameras, and microphones. Explicit indication of use includes, for example,
  signals to users when collaborative computing devices are activated. Related
  control: AC-21.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing collaborative computing; access control policy and procedures;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with responsibilities for managing collaborative
  computing devices].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  management of remote activation of collaborative computing devices; automated
  mechanisms providing an indication of use of collaborative computing devices].

  001150: The information system prohibits remote activation of collaborative
  computing devices excluding the organization-defined exceptions where remote
  activation is to be allowed.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  prohibit remote activation of collaborative computing devices excluding
  dedicated VTC suites located in approved VTC locations that are centrally
  managed. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs,
  the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG
  guidance that pertains to CCI 1150. DoD has defined the exceptions as
  dedicated VTC suites located in approved VTC locations that are centrally
  managed.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable collaborative computing devices configuration files.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks pertaining to CCI 1150.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to prohibit remote activation of collaborative computing
  devices excluding dedicated VTC suites located in approved VTC locations that
  are centrally managed. For information system components that have applicable
  STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates
  the components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 1150. DoD has defined the exceptions as dedicated VTC
  suites located in approved VTC locations that are centrally managed.
