  Description:

  The information system restricts the ability of individuals to launch
  [Assignment: organization-defined denial of service attacks] against other
  information systems.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Restricting the ability of individuals to launch denial of service attacks
  requires that the mechanisms used for such attacks are unavailable.
  Individuals of concern can include, for example, hostile insiders or external
  adversaries that have successfully breached the information system and are
  using the system as a platform to launch cyber attacks on third parties.
  Organizations can restrict the ability of individuals to connect and transmit
  arbitrary information on the transport medium (i.e., network, wireless
  spectrum). Organizations can also limit the ability of individuals to use
  excessive information system resources. Protection against individuals having
  the ability to launch denial of service attacks may be implemented on specific
  information systems or on boundary devices prohibiting egress to potential
  target systems.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing denial of service protection; information system design
  documentation; security plan; list of denial of service attacks launched by
  individuals against information systems; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with incident response responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms restricting the ability to launch
  denial of service attacks against other information systems].

cci-definition: >-
  002387: The organization defines the denial of service attacks against other
  information systems the information system is to restrict the ability of
  individuals to launch.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the denial of
  service attacks against other information systems the information system is to
  restrict the ability of individuals to launch. DoD has determined the denial
  of service attacks as not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Threat Model.

  2.) System Security Plan (SSP) or any other documentation that defines the
  denial of service attacks against other information systems the information
  system is to restrict the ability of individuals to launch.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented denial of service attacks to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed defines the denial of service attacks against other
  information systems the information system is to restrict the ability of
  individuals to launch. DoD has determined the denial of service attacks as not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
