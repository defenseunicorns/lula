control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system routes [Assignment: organization-defined internal
  communications traffic] to [Assignment: organization-defined external
  networks] through authenticated proxy servers at managed interfaces.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  External networks are networks outside of organizational control. A proxy
  server is a server (i.e., information system or application) that acts as an
  intermediary for clients requesting information system resources (e.g., files,
  connections, web pages, or services) from other organizational servers. Client
  requests established through an initial connection to the proxy server are
  evaluated to manage complexity and to provide additional protection by
  limiting direct connectivity. Web content filtering devices are one of the
  most common proxy servers providing access to the Internet. Proxy servers
  support logging individual Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) sessions and
  blocking specific Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), domain names, and Internet
  Protocol (IP) addresses. Web proxies can be configured with
  organization-defined lists of authorized and unauthorized websites. Related
  controls: AC-3, AU-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; information system design documentation;
  information system hardware and software; information system architecture;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing traffic management
  through authenticated proxy servers at managed interfaces].

  001113: The organization defines the internal communications traffic to be
  routed to external networks.

  DoD has defined the internal communications traffic as protocols as designated
  by PPSM guidance (e.g. HTTPS, HTTP, FTP, SNMP).


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically compliant.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed is automatically compliant with this
  CCI because they are covered at the DoD level. DoD has defined the internal
  communications traffic as protocols as designated by PPSM guidance (e.g.
  HTTPS, HTTP, FTP, SNMP).
