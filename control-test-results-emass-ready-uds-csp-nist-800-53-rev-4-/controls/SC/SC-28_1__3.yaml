control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to prevent
  unauthorized disclosure and modification of [Assignment: organization-defined
  information] on [Assignment: organization-defined information system
  components].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect the
  confidentiality and integrity of organizational information. The strength of
  mechanism is commensurate with the security category and/or classification of
  the information. This control enhancement applies to significant
  concentrations of digital media in organizational areas designated for media
  storage and also to limited quantities of media generally associated with
  information system components in operational environments (e.g., portable
  storage devices, mobile devices). Organizations have the flexibility to either
  encrypt all information on storage devices (i.e., full disk encryption) or
  encrypt specific data structures (e.g., files, records, or fields).
  Organizations employing cryptographic mechanisms to protect information at
  rest also consider cryptographic key management solutions. Related controls:
  AC-19, SC-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  002475: Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized
  modification of organization-defined information when at rest on
  organization-defined system components.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized modification of
  information at rest defined in SC-28 (1), CCI 2473 on any information system
  components storing data defined in SC-28 (1), 2473. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  2475. DoD has defined the information system components as any information
  system components storing data defined in SC-28 (1), 2473.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks pertains to CCI 2475.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent
  unauthorized modification of information at rest defined in SC-28 (1), CCI
  2473 on any information system components storing data defined in SC-28 (1),
  2473. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs,
  the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components
  to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 2475. DoD has defined the information system components as any
  information system components storing data defined in SC-28 (1), 2473.

  UDS ensures protection of confidentiality and integrity of information at rest
  by employing industry-standard encryption practices. Specifically, data at
  rest, including persistent storage used by platform components like Keycloak,
  Grafana, Loki logs, and any Kubernetes persistent volumes, are encrypted using
  widely accepted, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms such as AES-256.
  Backups managed through Velero can be configured for encryption, ensuring data
  remains secure even when stored externally.
