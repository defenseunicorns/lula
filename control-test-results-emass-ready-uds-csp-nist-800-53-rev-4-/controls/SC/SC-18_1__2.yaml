family: SC
control-acronym: SC-18(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system identifies [Assignment: organization-defined
  unacceptable mobile code] and takes [Assignment: organization-defined
  corrective actions].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Corrective actions when unacceptable mobile code is detected include, for
  example, blocking, quarantine, or alerting administrators. Blocking includes,
  for example, preventing transmission of word processing files with embedded
  macros when such macros have been defined to be unacceptable mobile code.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing mobile code; mobile code usage restrictions, mobile code
  implementation policy and procedures; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation; list
  of unacceptable mobile code; list of corrective actions to be taken when
  unacceptable mobile code is identified; information system monitoring records;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with responsibilities for managing mobile code].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing mobile
  code detection, inspection, and corrective capability].

  001662: The information system takes organization-defined corrective action
  when organization-defined unacceptable mobile code is identified.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  take corrective actions defined in SC-18 (1), CCI 2457 when unacceptable
  mobile code defined in SC-18 (1), CCI 2458 is identified. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  1662.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Description of the process which organization implements when
  organization-defined unacceptable mobile code is identified.

  2.) Signed and dated system and communications protection policy (reference
  mobile code section).

  3.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks pertaining to CCI 1166 and 1662.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to take corrective actions defined in SC-18 (1), CCI 2457
  when unacceptable mobile code defined in SC-18 (1), CCI 2458 is identified.
  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 1662.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS is primarily designed for secure
  application deployment and operations within Kubernetes clusters. It does not
  inherently utilize or permit execution of mobile code (such as Java applets,
  ActiveX controls, or scripts downloaded and executed directly by user
  endpoints). Any policies regarding acceptable or unacceptable mobile code
  technologies would be organizationally defined and enforced on client
  endpoints or application-specific components outside the UDS core platform.)
