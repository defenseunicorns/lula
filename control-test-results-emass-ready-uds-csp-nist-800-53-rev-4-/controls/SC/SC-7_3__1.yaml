  Description:

  The organization limits the number of external network connections to the
  information system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Limiting the number of external network connections facilitates more
  comprehensive monitoring of inbound and outbound communications traffic. The
  Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) initiative is an example of limiting the
  number of external network connections.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; information system design documentation;
  boundary protection hardware and software; information system architecture and
  configuration documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; communications and network traffic monitoring logs;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing boundary protection
  capability; automated mechanisms limiting the number of external network
  connections to the information system].

  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements information
  system access control mechanisms to limit the number of external connections
  to the information system.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system communications protection policy.

  2.) Current network topology diagrams.

  3.) Architecture documentation or any other relevant documentation.

  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented access control mechanisms to ensure that the organization being
  inspected/assessed limits the number of external network connections to the
  information system.

test-results: "UDS uses dedicated gateways and proxies as the only access points into the cluster. For example, the Istio ingress gateway is the only component listening for external requests; it√¢\x80\x99s configured to allow only specific ports and protocols. There are no other open ports on the cluster nodes for UDS services unless declared. Management access (SSH/Kubernetes API) is similarly limited to admin interfaces. This single chokepoint design means the external exposure is minimal and well-defended"
