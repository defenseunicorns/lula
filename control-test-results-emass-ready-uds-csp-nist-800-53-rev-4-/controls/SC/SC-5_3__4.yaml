control-acronym: SC-5(3)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Employs [Assignment: organization-defined monitoring tools] to detect
  indicators of denial of service attacks against the information system; and

  (b) Monitors [Assignment: organization-defined information system resources]
  to determine if sufficient resources exist to prevent effective denial of
  service attacks.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations consider utilization and capacity of information system
  resources when managing risk from denial of service due to malicious attacks.
  Denial of service attacks can originate from external or internal sources.
  Information system resources sensitive to denial of service include, for
  example, physical disk storage, memory, and CPU cycles. Common safeguards to
  prevent denial of service attacks related to storage utilization and capacity
  include, for example, instituting disk quotas, configuring information systems
  to automatically alert administrators when specific storage capacity
  thresholds are reached, using file compression technologies to maximize
  available storage space, and imposing separate partitions for system and user
  data. Related controls: CA-7, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing denial of service protection; information system design
  documentation; information system monitoring tools and techniques
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with detection and monitoring responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms/tools implementing information system
  monitoring for denial of service attacks].

  002391: Monitor organization-defined system resources to determine if
  sufficient resources exist to prevent effective denial of service attacks.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed monitors information system
  resources defined in SC-5 (3), CCI 2390 to determine if sufficient resources
  exist to prevent effective denial of service attacks.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation that defines monitoring procedures.

  2.) Monitoring process artifacts.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented monitoring procedures and any available artifacts from the
  monitoring process to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  monitors information system resources defined in SC-5 (3), CCI 2390 to
  determine if sufficient resources exist to prevent effective denial of service
  attacks.
