control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for Voice over
  Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies based on the potential to cause damage
  to the information system if used maliciously; and

  b. Authorizes, monitors, and controls the use of VoIP within the information
  system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related controls: CM-6, SC-7, SC-15.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing VoIP; VoIP usage restrictions; VoIP implementation guidance;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; information system monitoring records;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with responsibilities for managing VoIP].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational process for authorizing, monitoring, and
  controlling VoIP; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  authorizing, monitoring, and controlling VoIP].

  system.

  The organization being inspected/assessed designs the information system to
  control the use of VoIP within the information system


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System protection policy.

  2.) Communications protection policy (reference VoIP section).
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines
  network topology diagrams, architecture documentation, or any other
  documentation identifying the use of VoIP to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed controls the use of VoIP within the information system.
