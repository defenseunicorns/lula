  Description:

  The information system:

  a. Monitors and controls communications at the external boundary of the system
  and at key internal boundaries within the system;

  b. Implements subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are
  [Selection: physically; logically] separated from internal organizational
  networks; and

  c. Connects to external networks or information systems only through managed
  interfaces consisting of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance
  with an organizational security architecture.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Managed interfaces include, for example, gateways, routers, firewalls, guards,
  network-based malicious code analysis and virtualization systems, or encrypted
  tunnels implemented within a security architecture (e.g., routers protecting
  firewalls or application gateways residing on protected subnetworks).
  Subnetworks that are physically or logically separated from internal networks
  are referred to as demilitarized zones or DMZs. Restricting or prohibiting
  interfaces within organizational information systems includes, for example,
  restricting external web traffic to designated web servers within managed
  interfaces and prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing
  internal addresses. Organizations consider the shared nature of commercial
  telecommunications services in the implementation of security controls
  associated with the use of such services. Commercial telecommunications
  services are commonly based on network components and consolidated management
  systems shared by all attached commercial customers, and may also include
  third party-provided access lines and other service elements. Such
  transmission services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract
  security provisions. Related controls: AC-4, AC-17, CA-3, CM-7, CP-8, IR-4,
  RA-3, SC-5, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; list of key internal boundaries of the
  information system; information system design documentation; boundary
  protection hardware and software; information system configuration settings
  and associated documentation; enterprise security architecture documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing boundary protection
  capability].

  001098: The information system connects to external networks or information
  systems only through managed interfaces consisting of boundary protection
  devices arranged in accordance with an organizational security architecture.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed designs the information system to
  enforce requirements that components connect to external networks or
  information systems only through managed interfaces consisting of boundary
  protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational security
  architecture.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Current network topology diagrams.

  2.) Architecture documentation or relevant documentation for identifying
  component connectivity.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines
  network topology diagrams, architecture documentation, or any other
  documentation identifying component connectivity to ensure the organization
  being inspected/assessed connects to external networks or information systems
  only through managed interfaces consisting of boundary protection devices
  arranged in accordance with an organizational security architecture.
