control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system generates a unique session identifier for each session
  with [Assignment: organization-defined randomness requirements] and recognizes
  only session identifiers that are system-generated.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement curtails the ability of adversaries from reusing
  previously valid session IDs. Employing the concept of randomness in the
  generation of unique session identifiers helps to protect against brute-force
  attacks to determine future session identifiers. Related control: SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing session authenticity; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  generating and monitoring unique session identifiers; automated mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing randomness requirements].

  001664: The information system recognizes only session identifiers that are
  system-generated.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  recognize only session identifiers that are system-generated. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  1664.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System-generated session identifiers.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to recognize only session identifiers that are
  system-generated. For information system components that have applicable STIGs
  or SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the
  components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 1664.

  UDS utilizes Keycloak for managing authentication sessions, which exclusively
  accepts session identifiers generated internally through its cryptographic
  mechanisms (JWT tokens and session cookies). Keycloak validates tokens and
  rejects any externally supplied or user-manipulated session identifiers that
  are not cryptographically verified.  Istio Service Mesh employs mutual TLS
  certificates issued internally through the embedded certificate authority
  (Citadel), strictly accepting only internally generated session credentials
  for secure inter-service communication.
