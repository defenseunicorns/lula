  Description:

  The information system disables feedback to senders on protocol format
  validation failure.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Disabling feedback to senders when there is a failure in protocol validation
  format prevents adversaries from obtaining information which would otherwise
  be unavailable.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; information system design documentation;
  information system hardware and software; information system architecture;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the
  disabling of feedback to senders on protocol format validation failure].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  disable feedback to senders on protocol format validation failure For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 2417.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Current Network diagram.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.

  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to disable feedback to senders on protocol format
  validation failure For information system components that have applicable
  STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates
  the components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 2417.

  UDS leverages Istio Service Mesh and Envoy Proxy, which inherently disable
  detailed feedback on protocol format validation failures to external senders.
  Specifically, Istio and Envoy proxies provide generic HTTP or TCP error
  messages (e.g., "400 Bad Request") when receiving invalid protocol formats
  without detailed diagnostics or stack traces. This prevents attackers from
  obtaining useful information for reconnaissance or exploitation. Additionally,
  Keycloak and AuthService provide generic error messages upon failed
  authentication or authorization attempts, further reducing feedback
  specificity.
