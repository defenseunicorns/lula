  Description:

  The information system prevents the download and execution of [Assignment:
  organization-defined unacceptable mobile code].


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing mobile code; mobile code usage restrictions, mobile code
  implementation policy and procedures; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with responsibilities for managing mobile code].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms preventing download and execution of
  unacceptable mobile code].

  001169: The information system prevents the download of organization-defined
  unacceptable mobile code.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  prevent the download of unacceptable mobile code defined in CCI 2459.

  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 1169.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks pertaining to CCI 1169.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to prevent the download of unacceptable mobile code defined
  in CCI 2459.

  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 1169.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS is primarily designed for secure
  application deployment and operations within Kubernetes clusters. It does not
  inherently utilize or permit execution of mobile code (such as Java applets,
  ActiveX controls, or scripts downloaded and executed directly by user
  endpoints). Any policies regarding acceptable or unacceptable mobile code
  technologies would be organizationally defined and enforced on client
  endpoints or application-specific components outside the UDS core platform.)
