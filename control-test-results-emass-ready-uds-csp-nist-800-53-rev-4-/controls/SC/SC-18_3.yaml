family: SC
control-acronym: SC-18
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Defines acceptable and unacceptable mobile code and mobile code
  technologies;

  b. Establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for acceptable
  mobile code and mobile code technologies; and

  c. Authorizes, monitors, and controls the use of mobile code within the
  information system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Decisions regarding the employment of mobile code within organizational
  information systems are based on the potential for the code to cause damage to
  the systems if used maliciously. Mobile code technologies include, for
  example, Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, Postscript, PDF, Shockwave movies, Flash
  animations, and VBScript. Usage restrictions and implementation guidance apply
  to both the selection and use of mobile code installed on servers and mobile
  code downloaded and executed on individual workstations and devices (e.g.,
  smart phones). Mobile code policy and procedures address preventing the
  development, acquisition, or introduction of unacceptable mobile code within
  organizational information systems. Related controls: AU-2, AU-12, CM-2, CM-6,
  SI-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing mobile code; mobile code usage restrictions, mobile code
  implementation policy and procedures; list of acceptable mobile code and
  mobile code technologies; list of unacceptable mobile code and mobile
  technologies; authorization records; information system monitoring records;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with responsibilities for managing mobile code].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational process for controlling, authorizing,
  monitoring, and restricting mobile code; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing the management of mobile code; automated mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing the monitoring of mobile code].
