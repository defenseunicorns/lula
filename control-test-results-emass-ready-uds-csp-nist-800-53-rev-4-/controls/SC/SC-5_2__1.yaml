control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system manages excess capacity, bandwidth, or other redundancy
  to limit the effects of information flooding denial of service attacks.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Managing excess capacity ensures that sufficient capacity is available to
  counter flooding attacks. Managing excess capacity may include, for example,
  establishing selected usage priorities, quotas, or partitioning.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing denial of service protection; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with incident response responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing management of
  information system bandwidth, capacity, and redundancy to limit the effects of
  information flooding denial of service attacks].

  001095: Manage capacity, bandwidth, or other redundancy to limit the effects
  of information flooding types of denial of service attacks.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  manage excess capacity, bandwidth, or other redundancy to limit the effects of
  information flooding types of denial of service attacks. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  1095.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Organization configuration documentation on how the organization
  configures the information system to manage excess capacity, bandwidth, or
  other redundancy to limit the effects of information flooding types of DoS
  attacks.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to manage excess capacity, bandwidth, or other redundancy
  to limit the effects of information flooding types of denial of service
  attacks. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs,
  the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components
  to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 1095.
