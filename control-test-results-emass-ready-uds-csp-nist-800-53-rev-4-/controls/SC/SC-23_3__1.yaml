family: SC
control-acronym: SC-23(3)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system generates a unique session identifier for each session
  with [Assignment: organization-defined randomness requirements] and recognizes
  only session identifiers that are system-generated.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement curtails the ability of adversaries from reusing
  previously valid session IDs. Employing the concept of randomness in the
  generation of unique session identifiers helps to protect against brute-force
  attacks to determine future session identifiers. Related control: SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing session authenticity; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  generating and monitoring unique session identifiers; automated mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing randomness requirements].

  001188: The information system generates unique session identifiers for each
  session with organization-defined randomness requirements.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  generate unique session identifiers for each session with randomness
  requirements defined in SC-23 (3), CCI 1189. For information system components
  that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed
  must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 1188.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation that describes organization-defined
  randomness requirements.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to generate unique session identifiers for each session
  with randomness requirements defined in SC-23 (3), CCI 1189. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization
  conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that
  the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the information
  system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI
  1188.

  UDS uses Keycloak for session management and authentication, generating unique
  and secure session identifiers in the form of cryptographically signed JSON
  Web Tokens (JWT). Keycloak employs industry-standard cryptographic libraries
  and secure randomness sources provided by the underlying operating system,
  ensuring session identifiers (tokens) meet stringent randomness and uniqueness
  requirements. The Istio Service Mesh generates unique cryptographic session
  identifiers (certificates) for each internal service-to-service session using
  secure random number generation compliant with best practices and DoD security
  standards.
