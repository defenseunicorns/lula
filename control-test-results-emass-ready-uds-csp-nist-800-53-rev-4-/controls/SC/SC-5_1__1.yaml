control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system restricts the ability of individuals to launch
  [Assignment: organization-defined denial of service attacks] against other
  information systems.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Restricting the ability of individuals to launch denial of service attacks
  requires that the mechanisms used for such attacks are unavailable.
  Individuals of concern can include, for example, hostile insiders or external
  adversaries that have successfully breached the information system and are
  using the system as a platform to launch cyber attacks on third parties.
  Organizations can restrict the ability of individuals to connect and transmit
  arbitrary information on the transport medium (i.e., network, wireless
  spectrum). Organizations can also limit the ability of individuals to use
  excessive information system resources. Protection against individuals having
  the ability to launch denial of service attacks may be implemented on specific
  information systems or on boundary devices prohibiting egress to potential
  target systems.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing denial of service protection; information system design
  documentation; security plan; list of denial of service attacks launched by
  individuals against information systems; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with incident response responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms restricting the ability to launch
  denial of service attacks against other information systems].

  001094: The information system restricts the ability of individuals to launch
  organization-defined denial of service attacks against other information
  systems.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  restrict the ability of individuals to launch denial of service attacks
  defined in SC-5 (1), CCI 2387 against other information systems. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 1094.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Configuration documentation on how organization configures the information
  system to restrict the ability of individuals to launch DoS attacks defined in
  SC-5 (1), CCI 2387 against other information systems.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to restrict the ability of individuals to launch denial of
  service attacks defined in SC-5 (1), CCI 2387 against other information
  systems. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs,
  the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components
  to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 1094.
