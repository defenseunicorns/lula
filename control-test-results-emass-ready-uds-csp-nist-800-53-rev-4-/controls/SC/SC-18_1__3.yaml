family: SC
control-acronym: SC-18(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system identifies [Assignment: organization-defined
  unacceptable mobile code] and takes [Assignment: organization-defined
  corrective actions].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Corrective actions when unacceptable mobile code is detected include, for
  example, blocking, quarantine, or alerting administrators. Blocking includes,
  for example, preventing transmission of word processing files with embedded
  macros when such macros have been defined to be unacceptable mobile code.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing mobile code; mobile code usage restrictions, mobile code
  implementation policy and procedures; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation; list
  of unacceptable mobile code; list of corrective actions to be taken when
  unacceptable mobile code is identified; information system monitoring records;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with responsibilities for managing mobile code].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing mobile
  code detection, inspection, and corrective capability].

  DoD has defined the corrective actions to be taken when organization-defined
  unacceptable mobile code is identified as the corrective actions defined in
  the Protection Profile for Web Browsers and Application SRG.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically compliant.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed is automatically compliant with this
  CCI because they are covered at the DoD level.

  DoD has defined the corrective actions to be taken when organization-defined
  unacceptable mobile code is identified as the corrective actions defined in
  the Protection Profile for Web Browsers and Application SRG.
