control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for [Assignment:
  organization-defined information system components] based on the potential to
  cause damage to the information system if used maliciously; and

  b. Authorizes, monitors, and controls the use of such components within the
  information system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information system components include hardware, software, or firmware
  components (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, mobile code, digital copiers,
  printers, scanners, optical devices, wireless technologies, mobile devices).
  Related controls: CM-6, SC-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing usage restrictions; usage restrictions; implementation policy and
  procedures; authorization records; information system monitoring records;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for authorizing, monitoring, and
  controlling use of components with usage restrictions; Automated mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing authorizing, monitoring, and controlling use of
  components with usage restrictions].

  002562: The organization monitors the use of organization-defined information
  system components which have the potential to cause damage to the information
  system if used maliciously.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to monitor the use of all information system components (through the use of an
  acceptable use agreement) which have the potential to cause damage to the
  information system if used maliciously. The organization must maintain an
  audit trail of monitoring. DoD has defined the information system components
  as all information system components (through the use of an acceptable use
  agreement). Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated user agreement.

  2.) System security plan (SSP) (reference "usage" section).
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented process as well as the audit trail of monitoring to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed monitors the use of all information
  system components (through the use of an acceptable use agreement). DoD has
  defined the information system components as all information system components
  (through the use of an acceptable use agreement).

test-results: >-
  In UDS, critical components that could cause significant damage if used
  maliciously are continuously monitored through an integrated observability
  framework. Tools such as Prometheus and Grafana provide real-time metrics and
  dashboards that capture usage patterns across components like Keycloak, Istio,
  and NeuVector. Loki aggregates detailed logs, enabling the detection of
  anomalous behaviors such as unauthorized access attempts or deviations from
  normal operating patterns that may indicate misuse.
