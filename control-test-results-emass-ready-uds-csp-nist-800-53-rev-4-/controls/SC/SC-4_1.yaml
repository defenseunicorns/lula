family: SC
control-acronym: SC-4
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system prevents unauthorized and unintended information
  transfer via shared system resources.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control prevents information, including encrypted representations of
  information, produced by the actions of prior users/roles (or the actions of
  processes acting on behalf of prior users/roles) from being available to any
  current users/roles (or current processes) that obtain access to shared system
  resources (e.g., registers, main memory, hard disks) after those resources
  have been released back to information systems. The control of information in
  shared resources is also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual
  information protection. This control does not address: (i) information
  remanence which refers to residual representation of data that has been
  nominally erased or removed; (ii) covert channels (including storage and/or
  timing channels) where shared resources are manipulated to violate information
  flow restrictions; or (iii) components within information systems for which
  there are only single users/roles. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, MP-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing information protection in shared system resources; information
  system design documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms preventing unauthorized and
  unintended transfer of information via shared system resources].

  001090: The information system prevents unauthorized and unintended
  information transfer via shared system resources.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system
  resources. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG
  guidance that pertains to CCI 1090.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Data flow diagram.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer
  via shared system resources. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 1090.

test-results: >-
  UDS platform implements robust isolation and resource management measures to
  prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system
  resources. Specifically, UDS utilizes Kubernetes namespace isolation combined
  with network policies enforced by Istio Service Mesh, ensuring strict
  segregation and controlled communication between containerized applications
  and microservices. Additionally, NeuVector continuously monitors container
  runtime behavior, network traffic, and system processes, proactively blocking
  unauthorized cross-container interactions or access to shared resources.
  Resource usage and activity monitoring are further supported by Prometheus and
  Grafana, enabling detection of anomalous or unauthorized resource consumption
  patterns. Collectively, these integrated mechanisms provide effective controls
  to mitigate the risk of unauthorized or unintended information transfer within
  shared system environments.
