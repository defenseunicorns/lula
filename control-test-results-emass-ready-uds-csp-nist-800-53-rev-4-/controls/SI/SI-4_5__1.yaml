control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system alerts [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
  roles] when the following indications of compromise or potential compromise
  occur: [Assignment: organization-defined compromise indicators].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Alerts may be generated from a variety of sources, including, for example,
  audit records or inputs from malicious code protection mechanisms, intrusion
  detection or prevention mechanisms, or boundary protection devices such as
  firewalls, gateways, and routers. Alerts can be transmitted, for example,
  telephonically, by electronic mail messages, or by text messaging.
  Organizational personnel on the notification list can include, for example,
  system administrators, mission/business owners, system owners, or information
  system security officers. Related controls: AU-5, PE-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing information system monitoring tools and techniques; information
  system monitoring tools and techniques documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; alerts/notifications
  generated based on compromise indicators; information system audit records;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers;;
  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the
  information system; organizational personnel with responsibility for
  monitoring the information system; organizational personnel with
  responsibility for the intrusion detection system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for intrusion
  detection/information system monitoring; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing intrusion detection/information system monitoring
  capability; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing alerts for
  compromise indicators].

cci-definition: >-
  001264: The organization defines indicators of compromise or potential
  compromise to the security of the information system which will result in
  information system alerts being provided to organization-defined personnel or
  roles.
implementation-guidance: >-
  DoD has defined the compromise indicators as real time intrusion detection and
  when there are threats identified by authoritative sources (e.g. CTOs) and IAW
  incident categories I, II, IV, & VII within CJCSM 6510.01B.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically compliant.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed is automatically compliant with this
  CCI because they are covered at the DoD level. DoD has defined the compromise
  indicators as real time intrusion detection and when there are threats
  identified by authoritative sources (e.g. CTOs) and IAW incident categories I,
  II, IV, & VII within CJCSM 6510.01B.
