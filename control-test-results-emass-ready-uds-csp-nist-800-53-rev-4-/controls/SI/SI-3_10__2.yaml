  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Employs [Assignment: organization-defined tools and techniques] to analyze
  the characteristics and behavior of malicious code; and

  (b) Incorporates the results from malicious code analysis into organizational
  incident response and flaw remediation processes.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The application of selected malicious code analysis tools and techniques
  provides organizations with a more in-depth understanding of adversary
  tradecraft (i.e., tactics, techniques, and procedures) and the functionality
  and purpose of specific instances of malicious code. Understanding the
  characteristics of malicious code facilitates more effective organizational
  responses to current and future threats. Organizations can conduct malicious
  code analyses by using reverse engineering techniques or by monitoring the
  behavior of executing code.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing malicious code protection; procedures addressing incident response;
  procedures addressing flaw remediation; information system design
  documentation; malicious code protection mechanisms, tools, and techniques;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  results from malicious code analyses; records of flaw remediation events
  resulting from malicious code analyses; information system audit records;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility for malicious code protection;
  organizational personnel responsible for flaw remediation; organizational
  personnel responsible for incident response/management].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational process for incident response;
  organizational process for flaw remediation; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing malicious code protection capability; tools and techniques
  for analysis of malicious code characteristics and behavior].

  002635: The organization defines the techniques to be employed to analyze the
  characteristics and behavior of malicious code.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the techniques
  to be employed to analyze the characteristics and behavior of malicious code.
  DoD has determined the techniques are not appropriate to define at the
  Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan that documents the techniques to be
  employed to analyze the characteristics and behavior of malicious code.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented techniques to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  defines the techniques to be employed to analyze the characteristics and
  behavior of malicious code. DoD has determined the techniques are not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
