  Description:

  The organization centrally manages spam protection mechanisms.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Central management is the organization-wide management and implementation of
  spam protection mechanisms. Central management includes planning,
  implementing, assessing, authorizing, and monitoring the organization-defined,
  centrally managed spam protection security controls. Related controls: AU-3,
  SI-2, SI-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing spam protection; spam protection mechanisms; information system
  design documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for spam
  protection; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for central management of spam
  protection; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing central
  management of spam protection].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to centrally manage spam protection mechanisms.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System security plan documents central management of spam
  protection mechanisms.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented process to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  centrally manages spam protection mechanisms.

test-results: "Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Spam protection â\x80\x93 relates to filtering spam in email or inputs. UDS doesnâ\x80\x99t have an email system or user-generated content filtering; thatâ\x80\x99s outside scope. If an app on UDS was an email server, that app would need spam filtering, but the platform itself is neutral here.)"
