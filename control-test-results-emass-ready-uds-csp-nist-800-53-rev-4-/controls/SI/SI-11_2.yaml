  Description:

  The information system:

  a. Generates error messages that provide information necessary for corrective
  actions without revealing information that could be exploited by adversaries;
  and

  b. Reveals error messages only to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel
  or roles].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations carefully consider the structure/content of error messages. The
  extent to which information systems are able to identify and handle error
  conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements.
  Information that could be exploited by adversaries includes, for example,
  erroneous logon attempts with passwords entered by mistake as the username,
  mission/business information that can be derived from (if not stated
  explicitly by) information recorded, and personal information such as account
  numbers, social security numbers, and credit card numbers. In addition, error
  messages may provide a covert channel for transmitting information. Related
  controls: AU-2, AU-3, SC-31.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing information system error handling; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; documentation providing structure/content of error messages;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  information input validation; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for error handling; automated
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing error handling; automated mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing management of error messages].

  001314: The information system reveals error messages only to
  organization-defined personnel or roles.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  reveal error messages only to the ISSO, ISSM, and SCA. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  1314. DoD has defined the personnel or roles as the ISSO, ISSM, and SCA.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System security plan defines who is authorized to receive
  error messages.

  2.) Protection software configuration documentation only transmits error
  message alerts to authorized personnel.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to reveal error messages only to the ISSO, ISSM, and SCA.
  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 1314. DoD has defined the personnel or roles as the ISSO, ISSM, and
  SCA.

  On the UDS infrastructure side, system component errors (like a stack trace in
  Keycloak) are not exposed to end users in a way that would leak
  security-critical info. UDS logs errors internally for debugging but those are
  protected by systems administrator access through RBAC which ensures critical
  error information is only available to organization-defined personnel or
  roles.
