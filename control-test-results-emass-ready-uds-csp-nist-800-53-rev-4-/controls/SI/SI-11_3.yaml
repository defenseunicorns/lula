family: SI
control-acronym: SI-11
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system:

  a. Generates error messages that provide information necessary for corrective
  actions without revealing information that could be exploited by adversaries;
  and

  b. Reveals error messages only to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel
  or roles].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations carefully consider the structure/content of error messages. The
  extent to which information systems are able to identify and handle error
  conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements.
  Information that could be exploited by adversaries includes, for example,
  erroneous logon attempts with passwords entered by mistake as the username,
  mission/business information that can be derived from (if not stated
  explicitly by) information recorded, and personal information such as account
  numbers, social security numbers, and credit card numbers. In addition, error
  messages may provide a covert channel for transmitting information. Related
  controls: AU-2, AU-3, SC-31.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing information system error handling; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; documentation providing structure/content of error messages;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  information input validation; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for error handling; automated
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing error handling; automated mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing management of error messages].
