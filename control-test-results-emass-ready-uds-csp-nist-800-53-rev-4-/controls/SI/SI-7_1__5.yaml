family: SI
control-acronym: SI-7(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system performs an integrity check of [Assignment:
  organization-defined software, firmware, and information] [Selection (one or
  more): at startup; at [Assignment: organization-defined transitional states or
  security-relevant events]; [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Security-relevant events include, for example, the identification of a new
  threat to which organizational information systems are susceptible, and the
  installation of new hardware, software, or firmware. Transitional states
  include, for example, system startup, restart, shutdown, and abort.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing software, firmware, and information integrity; information system
  design documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; integrity verification tools and associated documentation;
  records of integrity scans; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  software, firmware, and/or information integrity; organizational personnel
  with information security responsibilities; system/network administrators;
  system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Software, firmware, and information integrity verification
  tools].

  002709: The organization defines the frequency at which it will perform
  integrity checks of software, firmware and information.
implementation-guidance: |-
  DoD has defined the frequency as annually.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:
  Automatically compliant.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed is automatically compliant with this
  CCI because they are covered at the DoD level. DoD has defined the frequency
