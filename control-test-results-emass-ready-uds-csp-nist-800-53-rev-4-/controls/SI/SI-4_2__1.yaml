  Description:

  The organization employs automated tools to support near real-time analysis of
  events.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Automated tools include, for example, host-based, network-based,
  transport-based, or storage-based event monitoring tools or Security
  Information and Event Management (SIEM) technologies that provide real time
  analysis of alerts and/or notifications generated by organizational
  information systems.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing information system monitoring tools and techniques; information
  system design documentation; information system monitoring tools and
  techniques documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility for monitoring the information
  system; organizational personnel with responsibility for incident
  response/management].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for near real-time analysis of
  events; organizational processes for information system monitoring; automated
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing information system monitoring;
  automated mechanisms/tools supporting and/or implementing analysis of events].

  001260: The organization employs automated tools to support near real-time
  analysis of events.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements automated
  tools to support near real-time analysis of events.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan documents what automated tools are
  used to support near real-time analysis of events. It must also cover
  configuration baseline for those automated tools.

  2.) Logs of automated tools.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines
  documentation of the use of the identified automated tools to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed employs automated tools to support near
  real-time analysis of events. The organization being inspected/assessed may be
  required to demonstrate use of their automated tools.
