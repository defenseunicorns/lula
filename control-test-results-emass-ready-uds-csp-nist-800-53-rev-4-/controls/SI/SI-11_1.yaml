  Description:

  The information system:

  a. Generates error messages that provide information necessary for corrective
  actions without revealing information that could be exploited by adversaries;
  and

  b. Reveals error messages only to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel
  or roles].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations carefully consider the structure/content of error messages. The
  extent to which information systems are able to identify and handle error
  conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements.
  Information that could be exploited by adversaries includes, for example,
  erroneous logon attempts with passwords entered by mistake as the username,
  mission/business information that can be derived from (if not stated
  explicitly by) information recorded, and personal information such as account
  numbers, social security numbers, and credit card numbers. In addition, error
  messages may provide a covert channel for transmitting information. Related
  controls: AU-2, AU-3, SC-31.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing information system error handling; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; documentation providing structure/content of error messages;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  information input validation; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for error handling; automated
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing error handling; automated mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing management of error messages].

  001312: Generates error messages that provide information necessary for
  corrective actions without revealing information that could be exploited.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  generate error messages that provide information necessary for corrective
  actions without revealing information that could be exploited by adversaries.
  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 1312.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System security plan documents that how error messages
  will be formulated to provide data for corrective action without revealing
  sensitive information.

  2.) Protection software configuration documentation that states useable
  information is in error messages without providing sensitive information.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to generate error messages that provide information
  necessary for corrective actions without revealing information that could be
  exploited by adversaries. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 1312.

test-results: "UDS components (Keycloak, etc.) are designed to handle errors securely (they won't spill sensitive info in logs or to users). For example, Keycloakâ\x80\x99s error messages are generic as noted, and system component errors generally do not reveal secrets. However, proper error handling in custom mission applications running on UDS must be implemented by those applications. The UDS platform doesnâ\x80\x99t modify application error messages. It does, however, centralize logs which can be monitored for error conditions without exposing them to end-users."
