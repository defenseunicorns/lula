  Description:

  The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined additional
  monitoring] of individuals who have been identified by [Assignment:
  organization-defined sources] as posing an increased level of risk.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Indications of increased risk from individuals can be obtained from a variety
  of sources including, for example, human resource records, intelligence
  agencies, law enforcement organizations, and/or other credible sources. The
  monitoring of individuals is closely coordinated with management, legal,
  security, and human resources officials within organizations conducting such
  monitoring and complies with federal legislation, Executive Orders, policies,
  directives, regulations, and standards.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing information system monitoring; information system design
  documentation; list of individuals who have been identified as posing an
  increased level of risk; information system monitoring tools and techniques
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility for monitoring the information
  system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for information system
  monitoring; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing system
  monitoring capability].

  002674: The organization defines the sources that may be used to identify
  individuals who pose an increased level of risk.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the sources
  that may be used to identify individuals who pose an increased level of risk.
  DoD has determined the sources are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise
  level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System security plan defines the sources that may be used
  to identify individuals who pose an increased level of risk.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented sources to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed defines
  the sources that may be used to identify individuals who pose an increased
  level of risk. DoD has determined the sources are not appropriate to define at
  the Enterprise level.
