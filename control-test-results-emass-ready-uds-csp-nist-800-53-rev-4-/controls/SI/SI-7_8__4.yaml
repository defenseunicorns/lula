family: SI
control-acronym: SI-7(8)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system, upon detection of a potential integrity violation,
  provides the capability to audit the event and initiates the following
  actions: [Selection (one or more): generates an audit record; alerts current
  user; alerts [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles];
  [Assignment: organization-defined other actions]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations select response actions based on types of software, specific
  software, or information for which there are potential integrity violations.
  Related controls: AU-2, AU-6, AU-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing software, firmware, and information integrity; information system
  design documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; integrity verification tools and associated documentation;
  records of integrity scans; incident response records, list of
  security-relevant changes to the information system; automated tools
  supporting alerts and notifications if unauthorized security changes are
  detected; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  software, firmware, and/or information integrity; organizational personnel
  with information security responsibilities; system/network administrators;
  system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Software, firmware, and information integrity verification
  tools; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the capability to
  audit potential integrity violations; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing alerts about potential integrity violations].

  002724: The information system, upon detection of a potential integrity
  violation, initiates one or more of following actions: generates an audit
  record; alerts current user; alerts organization-defined personnel or roles;
  and/or organization-defined other actions.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  initiate one or more of following actions: generates an audit record; alerts
  current user; alerts at a minimum, the ISSO and ISSM; and/or other actions
  defined in SI-7 (8), CCI 2722 upon detection of a potential integrity
  violation. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG
  guidance that pertains to CCI 2724. DoD has defined the personnel or roles as
  at a minimum, the ISSO and ISSM.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Configuration documentation for the information system to initiate one or
  more of following actions: generates an audit record; alerts current user;
  alerts at a minimum, the ISSO and ISSM; and/or other actions defined in SI-7
  (8), CCI 2722 upon detection of a potential integrity violation.

  2.) Audit records of alerts or other actions defined in SI-7(8), CCI 2722.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to initiate one or more of following actions: generates an
  audit record; alerts current user; alerts at a minimum, the ISSO and ISSM;
  and/or other actions defined in SI-7 (8), CCI 2722 upon detection of a
  potential integrity violation. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 2724. DoD has defined the
  personnel or roles as at a minimum, the ISSO and ISSM.

test-results: >-
  UDS actively responds to potential integrity violations through its integrated
  security tools. Specifically, NeuVector immediately detects unauthorized
  container modifications, runtime anomalies, and integrity deviations,
  automatically generating detailed audit records and real-time alerts to
  designated security administrators. Additionally, Vector and Loki aggregate
  these security event logs, preserving detailed audit trails. Alerts generated
  by NeuVector and metrics monitored via Prometheus and Grafana ensure rapid
  visibility of potential integrity violations, notifying defined organizational
  personnel or security roles to facilitate timely incident response.
  Collectively, these capabilities meet the requirement by promptly initiating
  audit logging and alerting actions upon detection of potential integrity
  violations.
