control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system monitors inbound and outbound communications traffic
  [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] for unusual or unauthorized
  activities or conditions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Unusual/unauthorized activities or conditions related to information system
  inbound and outbound communications traffic include, for example, internal
  traffic that indicates the presence of malicious code within organizational
  information systems or propagating among system components, the unauthorized
  exporting of information, or signaling to external information systems.
  Evidence of malicious code is used to identify potentially compromised
  information systems or information system components.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing information system monitoring tools and techniques; information
  system design documentation; information system monitoring tools and
  techniques documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; information system protocols; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility for monitoring the information
  system; organizational personnel with responsibility for the intrusion
  detection system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for intrusion
  detection/information system monitoring; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing intrusion detection capability/information system
  monitoring; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing monitoring of
  inbound/outbound communications traffic].

cci-definition: >-
  002662: The information system monitors outbound communications traffic per
  organization-defined frequency for unusual or unauthorized activities or
  conditions.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  monitor outbound communications traffic continuously for unusual or
  unauthorized activities or conditions. DoD has defined the frequency as
  continuously.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan with reference to section pertaining
  to how outbound communications are monitored for unusual or unauthorized
  activities or conditions and the frequency of that monitoring (DoD
  recommendation is continuously).
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to monitor outbound communications traffic continuously for
  unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions. DoD has defined the
  frequency as continuously.
