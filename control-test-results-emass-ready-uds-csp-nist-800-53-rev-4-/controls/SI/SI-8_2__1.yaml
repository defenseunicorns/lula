  Description:

  The information system automatically updates spam protection mechanisms.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing spam protection; spam protection mechanisms; records of spam
  protection updates; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for spam
  protection; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for spam protection; automated
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing automatic updates to spam protection
  mechanisms].

  001308: The information system automatically updates spam protection
  mechanisms .
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  automatically update spam protection mechanisms. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  1308.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System security plan documents what spam protection
  updates are applied automatically.

  2.) Protection software logs.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to automatically update spam protection mechanisms. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 1308.

test-results: "Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Spam protection â\x80\x93 relates to filtering spam in email or inputs. UDS doesnâ\x80\x99t have an email system or user-generated content filtering; thatâ\x80\x99s outside scope. If an app on UDS was an email server, that app would need spam filtering, but the platform itself is neutral here.)"
