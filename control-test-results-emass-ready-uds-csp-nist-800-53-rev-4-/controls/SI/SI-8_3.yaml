control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Employs spam protection mechanisms at information system entry and exit
  points to detect and take action on unsolicited messages; and

  b. Updates spam protection mechanisms when new releases are available in
  accordance with organizational configuration management policy and procedures.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information system entry and exit points include, for example, firewalls,
  electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, remote-access servers,
  workstations, mobile devices, and notebook/laptop computers. Spam can be
  transported by different means including, for example, electronic mail,
  electronic mail attachments, and web accesses. Spam protection mechanisms
  include, for example, signature definitions. Related controls: AT-2, AT-3,
  SC-5, SC-7, SI-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; configuration
  management policy and procedures (CM-1); procedures addressing spam
  protection; spam protection mechanisms; records of spam protection updates;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for spam
  protection; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for implementing spam protection;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing spam protection].

  001306: The organization updates spam protection mechanisms when new releases
  are available in accordance with organizational configuration management
  policy and procedures.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to update spam protection mechanisms when new releases are available in
  accordance with organizational configuration management policy and procedures.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System security plan documents update procedures for spam
  protection mechanisms.

  2.) Update log and update implementation documentation.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented process and examines the spam protection mechanisms to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed updates spam protection mechanisms when
  new releases are available in accordance with organizational configuration
  management policy and procedures.

test-results: "Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Spam protection â\x80\x93 relates to filtering spam in email or inputs. UDS doesnâ\x80\x99t have an email system or user-generated content filtering; thatâ\x80\x99s outside scope. If an app on UDS was an email server, that app would need spam filtering, but the platform itself is neutral here.)"
