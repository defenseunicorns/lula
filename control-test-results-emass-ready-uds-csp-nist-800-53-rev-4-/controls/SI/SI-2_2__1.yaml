  Description:

  The organization employs automated mechanisms [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] to determine the state of information system
  components with regard to flaw remediation.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related controls: CM-6, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing flaw remediation; automated mechanisms supporting centralized
  management of flaw remediation; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility for flaw remediation].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms used to determine the state of
  information system components with regard to flaw remediation].

  001233: The organization employs automated mechanisms on an
  organization-defined frequency to determine the state of information system
  components with regard to flaw remediation.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  employ automated mechanisms continuously with HBSS; 30 days for any additional
  internal network scans not covered by HBSS; annually for external scans by
  (Computer Network Defense Service Provider) CNDSP to determine the state of
  information system components with regard to flaw remediation. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  1233. DoD has defined the frequency as continuously with HBSS; 30 days for any
  additional internal network scans not covered by HBSS; annually for external
  scans by (Computer Network Defense Service Provider) CNDSP.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan.

  2.) Reports and results from annual Computer Network Defense Service Provider
  scans (System security plan must document Computer Network Defense Service
  Plan information for comparison to scan results).

  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to employ automated mechanisms continuously with HBSS; 30
  days for any additional internal network scans not covered by HBSS; annually
  for external scans by (Computer Network Defense Service Provider) CNDSP to
  determine the state of information system components with regard to flaw
  remediation. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the
  components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 1233. DoD has defined the frequency as continuously
  with HBSS; 30 days for any additional internal network scans not covered by
  HBSS; annually for external scans by (Computer Network Defense Service
  Provider) CNDSP.

  Defense Unicorns will provide updated and hardened images at a frequency
  according to the SLA between the organization. Defense Unicorns provides this
  as a service to organizations and is automated. Defense Unicorns provides
  updated vulnerability databases according to the agreed frequency per the SLA
  to easily determine the flaw remediation state in the UDS UI.
