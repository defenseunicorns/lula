family: SI
control-acronym: SI-7(8)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system, upon detection of a potential integrity violation,
  provides the capability to audit the event and initiates the following
  actions: [Selection (one or more): generates an audit record; alerts current
  user; alerts [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles];
  [Assignment: organization-defined other actions]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations select response actions based on types of software, specific
  software, or information for which there are potential integrity violations.
  Related controls: AU-2, AU-6, AU-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing software, firmware, and information integrity; information system
  design documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; integrity verification tools and associated documentation;
  records of integrity scans; incident response records, list of
  security-relevant changes to the information system; automated tools
  supporting alerts and notifications if unauthorized security changes are
  detected; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  software, firmware, and/or information integrity; organizational personnel
  with information security responsibilities; system/network administrators;
  system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Software, firmware, and information integrity verification
  tools; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the capability to
  audit potential integrity violations; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing alerts about potential integrity violations].

  002722: The organization defines other actions that can be taken when the
  information system detects a potential integrity violation.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents other actions
  that can be taken when the information system detects a potential integrity
  violation. DoD has determined the other actions are not appropriate to define
  at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System security plan defines the other actions that can
  be taken when the information system detects a potential integrity violation.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented other actions to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  defines other actions that can be taken when the information system detects a
  potential integrity violation. DoD has determined the other actions are not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  This likely refers to detecting unauthorized changes to software and
  information. As described, NeuVector is effectively doing this it will detect
  if any unexpected process or file change occurs in a container beyond what was
  present at deployment. Also, any changes to Kubernetes resources (adding a new
  pod, changing a config) are logged and can be monitored an unauthorized change
  (like someone applying a manifest outside of GitOps) can trigger an alert via
  admission control tools (Pepr could block or log it). So the infrastructure is
  in place to catch if something deviates from the baseline. This could be
  considered integrity monitoring. For example, if an attacker managed to modify
  a container image on disk, its hash would differ and would notice either
  failing to start the container or flagging it as un-scanned. UDS covers
  continuous verification and alerts on any unauthorized modifications.
