control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization correlates information from monitoring tools employed
  throughout the information system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Correlating information from different monitoring tools can provide a more
  comprehensive view of information system activity. The correlation of
  monitoring tools that usually work in isolation (e.g., host monitoring,
  network monitoring, anti-virus software) can provide an organization-wide view
  and in so doing, may reveal otherwise unseen attack patterns. Understanding
  the capabilities/limitations of diverse monitoring tools and how to maximize
  the utility of information generated by those tools can help organizations to
  build, operate, and maintain effective monitoring programs. Related control:
  AU-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing information system monitoring tools and techniques; information
  system design documentation; information system monitoring tools and
  techniques documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; event correlation logs or records; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility for monitoring the information
  system; organizational personnel with responsibility for the intrusion
  detection system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for intrusion
  detection/information system monitoring; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing intrusion detection/information system monitoring
  capability; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing correlation of
  information from monitoring tools].

  001283: The organization correlates information from monitoring tools employed
  throughout the information system.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to correlate information from monitoring tools employed throughout the
  information system.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan documents a process to correlate
  information from monitoring tools employed throughout the information system.

  2.) Correlated information from monitoring tools employed throughout the
  information system.

  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented process and the correlated results to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed correlates information from monitoring tools employed
  throughout the information system.
