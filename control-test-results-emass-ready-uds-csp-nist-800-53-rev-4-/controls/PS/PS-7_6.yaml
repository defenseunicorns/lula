  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Establishes personnel security requirements including security roles and
  responsibilities for third-party providers;

  b. Requires third-party providers to comply with personnel security policies
  and procedures established by the organization;

  c. Documents personnel security requirements;

  d. Requires third-party providers to notify [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles] of any personnel transfers or terminations of third-party
  personnel who possess organizational credentials and/or badges, or who have
  information system privileges within [Assignment: organization-defined time
  period]; and

  e. Monitors provider compliance.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Third-party providers include, for example, service bureaus, contractors, and
  other organizations providing information system development, information
  technology services, outsourced applications, and network and security
  management. Organizations explicitly include personnel security requirements
  in acquisition-related documents. Third-party providers may have personnel
  working at organizational facilities with credentials, badges, or information
  system privileges issued by organizations. Notifications of third-party
  personnel changes ensure appropriate termination of privileges and
  credentials. Organizations define the transfers and terminations deemed
  reportable by security-related characteristics that include, for example,
  functions, roles, and nature of credentials/privileges associated with
  individuals transferred or terminated. Related controls: PS-2, PS-3, PS-4,
  PS-5, PS-6, SA-9, SA-21.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Personnel security policy; procedures addressing
  third-party personnel security; list of personnel security requirements;
  acquisition documents; service-level agreements; compliance monitoring
  process; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with personnel security
  responsibilities; third-party providers; system/network administrators;
  organizational personnel with account management responsibilities;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing and monitoring
  third-party personnel security; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing monitoring of provider compliance].
