control-acronym: PS-5
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Reviews and confirms ongoing operational need for current logical and
  physical access authorizations to information systems/facilities when
  individuals are reassigned or transferred to other positions within the
  organization;

  b. Initiates [Assignment: organization-defined transfer or reassignment
  actions] within [Assignment: organization-defined time period following the
  formal transfer action];

  c. Modifies access authorization as needed to correspond with any changes in
  operational need due to reassignment or transfer; and

  d. Notifies [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] within
  [Assignment: organization-defined time period].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies when reassignments or transfers of individuals are
  permanent or of such extended durations as to make the actions warranted.
  Organizations define actions appropriate for the types of reassignments or
  transfers, whether permanent or extended. Actions that may be required for
  personnel transfers or reassignments to other positions within organizations
  include, for example: (i) returning old and issuing new keys, identification
  cards, and building passes; (ii) closing information system accounts and
  establishing new accounts; (iii) changing information system access
  authorizations (i.e., privileges); and (iv) providing for access to official
  records to which individuals had access at previous work locations and in
  previous information system accounts. Related controls: AC-2, IA-4, PE-2,
  PS-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  personnel transfer; security plan; records of personnel transfer actions; list
  of information system and facility access authorizations; other relevant
  documents or records].

  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with

  003032: The organization notifies organization-defined personnel or roles
  within an organization-defined time period when individuals are transferred or
  reassigned to other positions within the organization.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed notifies at a minimum, the ISSO and
  personnel responsible for transferring credentials within 24 hours when
  individuals are transferred or reassigned to other positions within the
  organization. The organization must maintain records of transfer/reassignment
  notifications. DoD has defined the personnel or roles as at a minimum, the
  ISSO and personnel responsible for transferring credentials. DoD has defined
  the time period as within 24 hours.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Records of transfer/reassignment notification.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines
  records of transfer/reassignment notifications to ensure the organization
  being inspected/assessed notifies at a minimum, the ISSO and personnel
  responsible for transferring credentials within 24 hours when individuals are
  transferred or reassigned to other positions within the organization. DoD has
  defined the personnel or roles as at a minimum, the ISSO and personnel
  responsible for transferring credentials. DoD has defined the time period as
  within 24 hours.
