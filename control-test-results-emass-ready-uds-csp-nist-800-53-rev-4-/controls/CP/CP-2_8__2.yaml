  Description:

  The organization identifies critical information system assets supporting
  essential missions and business functions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations may choose to carry out the contingency planning activities in
  this control enhancement as part of organizational business continuity
  planning including, for example, as part of business impact analyses.
  Organizations identify critical information system assets so that additional
  safeguards and countermeasures can be employed (above and beyond those
  safeguards and countermeasures routinely implemented) to help ensure that
  organizational missions/business functions can continue to be conducted during
  contingency operations. In addition, the identification of critical
  information assets facilitates the prioritization of organizational resources.
  Critical information system assets include technical and operational aspects.
  Technical aspects include, for example, information technology services,
  information system components, information technology products, and
  mechanisms. Operational aspects include, for example, procedures (manually
  executed operations) and personnel (individuals operating technical safeguards
  and/or executing manual procedures). Organizational program protection plans
  can provide assistance in identifying critical assets. Related controls:
  SA-14, SA-15.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  documentation is an organizational responsibility as it is custom to their
  mission.)
