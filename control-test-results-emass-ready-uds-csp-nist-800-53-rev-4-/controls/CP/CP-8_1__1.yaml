  Description:

  The organization

  (a) Develops primary and alternate telecommunications service agreements that
  contain priority-of-service provisions in accordance with organizational
  availability requirements (including recovery time objectives); and

  (b) Requests Telecommunications Service Priority for all telecommunications
  services used for national security emergency preparedness in the event that
  the primary and/or alternate telecommunications services are provided by a
  common carrier.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations consider the potential mission/business impact in situations
  where telecommunications service providers are servicing other organizations
  with similar priority-of-service provisions.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  primary and alternate telecommunications services; contingency plan; primary
  and alternate telecommunications service agreements; Telecommunications
  Service Priority documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency plan
  telecommunications responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  system recovery responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibility for
  acquisitions/contractual agreements].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting telecommunications].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.
