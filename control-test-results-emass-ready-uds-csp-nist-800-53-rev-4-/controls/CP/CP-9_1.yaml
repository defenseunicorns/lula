family: CP
control-acronym: CP-9
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Conducts backups of user-level information contained in the information
  system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency consistent with recovery
  time and recovery point objectives];

  b. Conducts backups of system-level information contained in the information
  system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency consistent with recovery
  time and recovery point objectives];

  c. Conducts backups of information system documentation including
  security-related documentation [Assignment: organization-defined frequency
  consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives]; and

  d. Protects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of backup
  information at storage locations.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  System-level information includes, for example, system-state information,
  operating system and application software, and licenses. User-level
  information includes any information other than system-level information.
  Mechanisms employed by organizations to protect the integrity of information
  system backups include, for example, digital signatures and cryptographic
  hashes. Protection of system backup information while in transit is beyond the
  scope of this control. Information system backups reflect the requirements in
  contingency plans as well as other organizational requirements for backing up
  information. Related controls: CP-2, CP-6, MP-4, MP-5, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  information system backup; contingency plan; backup storage location(s);
  information system backup logs or records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  backup responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for conducting information system
  backups; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing information
  system backups].

ap-acronym: CP-9.1
cci: 534
cci-definition: >-
  000534: The organization defines frequency of conducting user-level
  information backups to support recovery time objectives and recovery point
  objectives.
implementation-guidance: >-
  DoD has defined the frequency as at least weekly as defined in the contingency
  plan.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically Compliant
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed is automatically compliant with this
  CCI because they are covered at the DoD level. DoD has defined the frequency
  as at least weekly as defined in the contingency plan.
