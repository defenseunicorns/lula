  Description:

  The organization transfers information system backup information to the
  alternate storage site [Assignment: organization-defined time period and
  transfer rate consistent with the recovery time and recovery point
  objectives].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information system backup information can be transferred to alternate storage
  sites either electronically or by physical shipment of storage media.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  information system backup; contingency plan; information system backup logs or
  records; evidence of system backup information transferred to alternate
  storage site; alternate storage site agreements; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  backup responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for transferring information
  system backups to the alternate storage site; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing information system backups; automated mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing information transfer to the alternate storage
  site].

  000547: The organization defines the time period and transfer rate of the
  information system backup information to the alternate storage site consistent
  with the recovery time and recovery point objectives.
implementation-guidance: >-
  DoD has defined the time period as Continuously (Availability High ) 24 hours
  (Availability Moderate) 7 days (Availability Low) as defined in the
  contingency plan.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically Compliant
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed is automatically compliant with this
  CCI because they are covered at the DoD level. DoD has defined the time period
  as Continuously (Availability High ) 24 hours (Availability Moderate) 7 days
  (Availability Low) as defined in the contingency plan.
