  Description:

  The organization identifies potential accessibility problems to the alternate
  processing site in the event of an area-wide disruption or disaster and
  outlines explicit mitigation actions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Area-wide disruptions refer to those types of disruptions that are broad in
  geographic scope (e.g., hurricane, regional power outage) with such
  determinations made by organizations based on organizational assessments of
  risk. Related control: RA-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  alternate processing sites; contingency plan; alternate processing site;
  alternate processing site agreements; primary processing site agreements;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency plan
  alternate processing site responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information system recovery responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.

  This control may be inheritable if customers choose an AWS region as an
  alternate storage site. However, if part of any system that is being created
  has components outside of AWS where this control applies, it is not

  001606: The organization outlines explicit mitigation actions for organization
  identified potential accessibility problems to the alternate processing site
  in the event of an area-wide disruption or disaster.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed must identify and document in the
  contingency plan explicit mitigation actions for accessibility problems
  identified in CP-7 (2), CCI 517 to the alternate processing site in the event
  of an area-wide disruption or disaster.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated disaster recovery plan
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  contingency plan to ensure the organization has documented explicit mitigation
  actions for accessibility problems identified in CP-7 (2), CCI 517 to the
  alternate processing site in the event of an area-wide disruption or disaster.
