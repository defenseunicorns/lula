  Description:

  The organization stores backup copies of [Assignment: organization-defined
  critical information system software and other security-related information]
  in a separate facility or in a fire-rated container that is not collocated
  with the operational system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Critical information system software includes, for example, operating systems,
  cryptographic key management systems, and intrusion detection/prevention
  systems. Security-related information includes, for example, organizational
  inventories of hardware, software, and firmware components. Alternate storage
  sites typically serve as separate storage facilities for organizations.
  Related controls: CM-2, CM-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  information system backup; contingency plan; backup storage location(s);
  information system backup configurations and associated documentation;
  information system backup logs or records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency planning
  and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information system backup responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].

  002850: The organization stores backup copies of organization defined critical
  information system software and other security-related information in a
  separate facility or in a fire-rated container that is not collocated with the
  operational system.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed stores backup copies of critical
  information system software and other security-related information defined in
  CP-9 (3), CCI 2849 in a separate facility or in a fire-rated container that is
  not collocated with the operational system. The organization must maintain a
  record of where software is stored.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) List of critical information system software which backup copies must be
  stored in a separate facility or in a fire-rated container
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  record of where software is stored to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed stores backup copies of critical information system
  software and other security-related information defined in CP-9 (3), CCI 2849
  in a separate facility or in a fire-rated container that is not collocated
  with the operational system.
