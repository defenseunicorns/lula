  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Establishes an alternate processing site including necessary agreements to
  permit the transfer and resumption of [Assignment: organization-defined
  information system operations] for essential missions/business functions
  within [Assignment: organization-defined time period consistent with recovery
  time and recovery point objectives] when the primary processing capabilities
  are unavailable;

  b. Ensures that equipment and supplies required to transfer and resume
  operations are available at the alternate processing site or contracts are in
  place to support delivery to the site within the organization-defined time
  period for transfer/resumption; and

  c. Ensures that the alternate processing site provides information security
  safeguards equivalent to that of the primary site.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Alternate processing sites are sites that are geographically distinct from
  primary processing sites. An alternate processing site provides processing
  capability in the event that the primary processing site is not available.
  Items covered by alternate processing site agreements include, for example,
  environmental conditions at alternate sites, access rules, physical and
  environmental protection requirements, and coordination for the
  transfer/assignment of personnel. Requirements are specifically allocated to
  alternate processing sites that reflect the requirements in contingency plans
  to maintain essential missions/business functions despite disruption,
  compromise, or failure in organizational information systems. Related
  controls: CP-2, CP-6, CP-8, CP-9, CP-10, MA-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  alternate processing sites; contingency plan; alternate processing site
  agreements; primary processing site agreements; spare equipment and supplies
  inventory at alternate processing site; equipment and supply contracts;
  service-level agreements; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  contingency planning and/or alternate site arrangements; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for recovery at the alternate
  site; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing recovery at the
  alternate processing site].
