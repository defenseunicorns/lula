control-acronym: CP-9
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Conducts backups of user-level information contained in the information
  system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency consistent with recovery
  time and recovery point objectives];

  b. Conducts backups of system-level information contained in the information
  system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency consistent with recovery
  time and recovery point objectives];

  c. Conducts backups of information system documentation including
  security-related documentation [Assignment: organization-defined frequency
  consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives]; and

  d. Protects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of backup
  information at storage locations.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  System-level information includes, for example, system-state information,
  operating system and application software, and licenses. User-level
  information includes any information other than system-level information.
  Mechanisms employed by organizations to protect the integrity of information
  system backups include, for example, digital signatures and cryptographic
  hashes. Protection of system backup information while in transit is beyond the
  scope of this control. Information system backups reflect the requirements in
  contingency plans as well as other organizational requirements for backing up
  information. Related controls: CP-2, CP-6, MP-4, MP-5, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  information system backup; contingency plan; backup storage location(s);
  information system backup logs or records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  backup responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for conducting information system
  backups; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing information
  system backups].

cci-definition: >-
  000537: The organization conducts backups of system-level information
  contained in the information system per organization-defined frequency that is
  consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed must identify system-level
  information within the backup strategy and configure the system to perform
  backups at least weekly and as required by system baseline configuration
  changes in accordance with the contingency plan.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated contingency plan, referencing frequency of backup
  sections

  2.) Sample or audit of backup
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and reviews the
  backup strategy, and examines a sample of systems to ensure they are
  configured to perform back ups at least weekly and as required by system
  baseline configuration changes in accordance with the contingency plan.

test-results: "UDS integrates Velero for backup and restoreâ\x80\x8B. Velero is configured to routinely (typically weekly per implementation guidance) back up Kubernetes resources and any persistent data (such as databases or storage volumes used by UDS components). These backups can be stored within the cluster or exported to an external storage location, providing data redundancy. For example, Velero can take scheduled snapshots of Keycloakâ\x80\x99s database and the state of applications. In an event of data loss or corruption, these backups are available to restore the system to a previous state."
