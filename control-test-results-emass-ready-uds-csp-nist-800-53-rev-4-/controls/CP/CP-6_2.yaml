  Description:

  The organization

  a. Establishes an alternate storage site including necessary agreements to
  permit the storage and retrieval of information system backup information; and

  b. Ensures that the alternate storage site provides information security
  safeguards equivalent to that of the primary site.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Alternate storage sites are sites that are geographically distinct from
  primary storage sites. An alternate storage site maintains duplicate copies of
  information and data in the event that the primary storage site is not
  available. Items covered by alternate storage site agreements include, for
  example, environmental conditions at alternate sites, access rules, physical
  and environmental protection requirements, and coordination of
  delivery/retrieval of backup media. Alternate storage sites reflect the
  requirements in contingency plans so that organizations can maintain essential
  missions/business functions despite disruption, compromise, or failure in
  organizational information systems. Related controls: CP-2, CP-7, CP-9, CP-10,
  MP-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  alternate storage sites; contingency plan; alternate storage site agreements;
  primary storage site agreements; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency plan
  alternate storage site responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information system recovery responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for storing and retrieving
  information system backup information at the alternate storage site; automated
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing storage and retrieval of information
  system backup information at the alternate storage site].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP
  Moderate Baseline, Rev 4
control-implementation-status: Inherited
security-control-designation: Hybrid
control-implementation-narrative: >-
  Customers can leverage multi-availability zone infrastructure and cross-region
  replication for services that support it to address alternate storage site
  controls if required by their organization.


  This control may be inheritable if customers choose an AWS region as an
  alternate storage site. However, if part of any system that is being created
  has components outside of AWS where this control applies, it is not
  inheritable....
ap-acronym: CP-6.2
cci: 2836
cci-definition: >-
  002836: The organization ensures that the alternate storage site provides
  information security safeguards equivalent to that of the primary site.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents the information security
  safeguards that are in place at both the primary and alternate sites and
  evidence that the alternate site was approved based on an assessment that
  security is equivalent at the alternate site.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation of the primary/alternate site information security
  safeguards that are in place

  2.) Signed documentation that the alternate site was approved based on an
  assessment that security is equivalent at the alternate site.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documentation of the primary/alternate site information security safeguards
  that are in place as well as evidence that the alternate site was approved
  based on an assessment that security is equivalent at the alternate site.
