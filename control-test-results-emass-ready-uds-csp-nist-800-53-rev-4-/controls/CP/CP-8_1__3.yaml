  Description:

  The organization

  (a) Develops primary and alternate telecommunications service agreements that
  contain priority-of-service provisions in accordance with organizational
  availability requirements (including recovery time objectives); and

  (b) Requests Telecommunications Service Priority for all telecommunications
  services used for national security emergency preparedness in the event that
  the primary and/or alternate telecommunications services are provided by a
  common carrier.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations consider the potential mission/business impact in situations
  where telecommunications service providers are servicing other organizations
  with similar priority-of-service provisions.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  primary and alternate telecommunications services; contingency plan; primary
  and alternate telecommunications service agreements; Telecommunications
  Service Priority documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency plan
  telecommunications responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  system recovery responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibility for
  acquisitions/contractual agreements].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting telecommunications].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.

cci-definition: >-
  000528: The organization requests Telecommunications Service Priority for all
  telecommunications services used for national security emergency preparedness
  in the event that the primary telecommunications services are provided by a
  common carrier.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed identifies and documents within the
  contingency plan any telecommunications services used for national security
  emergency preparedness. If the primary telecommunications services are
  provided by a common carrier, the organization formally requests
  Telecommunications Service Priority IAW the DHS Telecommunications Service
  Priority Process http://www.dhs.gov/telecommunications-service-priority-tsp.
  If the primary telecommunications services are provided by a mid-tier provider
  instead of a common carrier (for example, DISA) the organization must insure
  that their provider formally requests Telecommunications Service Priority on
  their behalf.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) SLA for telecommunication systems
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  contingency plan, the telecommunication service agreement, and any existing
  formal requests for Telecommunications Service Priority.


  The purpose of the review is to ensure the organization or the mid-tier
  provider has requested Telecommunications Service Priority for all
  telecommunications services used for national security emergency preparedness
  where the primary telecommunications services are provided by a common
  carrier.
