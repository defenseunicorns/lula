  Description:

  The organization protects backup and restoration hardware, firmware, and
  software.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Protection of backup and restoration hardware, firmware, and software
  components includes both physical and technical safeguards. Backup and
  restoration software includes, for example, router tables, compilers, and
  other security-relevant system software. Related controls: AC-3, AC-6, PE-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  information system recovery and reconstitution; contingency plan; information
  system design documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; logical access credentials; physical access
  credentials; logical access authorization records; physical access
  authorization records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  recovery and reconstitution responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for protecting backup and
  restoration hardware, firmware, and software; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing protection of backup and restoration hardware, firmware,
  and software].

  UDS secures its backup and restoration software through several integrated
  controls. Specifically, UDS utilizes Velero for managing backups and restores,
  which includes built-in security mechanisms such as role-based access controls
  (RBAC) enforced through Kubernetes, and encryption capabilities ensuring
  backup data remains secure both in transit and at rest. Access to Velero
  backups and restores is further protected through the identity and access
  management solution provided by Keycloak, enforcing strict authentication and
  authorization policies. Additionally, all software components, including
  Velero, are securely packaged and distributed via signed Zarf packages,
  ensuring software integrity throughout deployment. Together, these measures
  effectively protect the backup and restoration software, fully addressing this
  control requirement.
