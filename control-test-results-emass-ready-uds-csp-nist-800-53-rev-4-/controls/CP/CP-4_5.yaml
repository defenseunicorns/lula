  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Tests the contingency plan for the information system [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] using [Assignment: organization-defined tests]
  to determine the effectiveness of the plan and the organizational readiness to
  execute the plan;

  b. Reviews the contingency plan test results; and

  c. Initiates corrective actions, if needed.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Methods for testing contingency plans to determine the effectiveness of the
  plans and to identify potential weaknesses in the plans include, for example,
  walk-through and tabletop exercises, checklists, simulations (parallel, full
  interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. Organizations conduct testing based
  on the continuity requirements in contingency plans and include a
  determination of the effects on organizational operations, assets, and
  individuals arising due to contingency operations. Organizations have
  flexibility and discretion in the breadth, depth, and timelines of corrective
  actions. Related controls: CP-2, CP-3, IR-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  000497: The organization initiates corrective actions, if needed, after
  reviewing the contingency plan test results.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed identifies and documents any
  corrective actions required after reviewing the contingency plan test results.
  The organization initiates corrective actions and tracks those actions within
  the POA&M.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Contingency plan test results

  2.) Documented corrective actions required

  3.) Contingency plan after action reports
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  contingency plan test results as well as any documented corrective actions
  required and ensures the corrective actions are being implemented and tracked
  within the POA&M.

  documentation is an organizational responsibility as it is custom to their
  mission.)
