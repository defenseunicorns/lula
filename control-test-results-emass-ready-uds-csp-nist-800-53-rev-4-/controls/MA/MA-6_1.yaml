control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization obtains maintenance support and/or spare parts for
  [Assignment: organization-defined information system components] within
  [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of failure.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations specify the information system components that result in
  increased risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
  organizations, or the Nation when the functionality provided by those
  components is not operational. Organizational actions to obtain maintenance
  support typically include having appropriate contracts in place. Related
  controls: CM-8, CP-2, CP-7, SA-14, SA-15.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system maintenance policy; procedures
  addressing information system maintenance; service provider contracts;
  service-level agreements; inventory and availability of spare parts; security
  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  maintenance responsibilities; organizational personnel with acquisition
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for ensuring timely maintenance].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP
  Moderate Baseline, Rev 4

  GovCloud employs an N+1 redundancy model for information system components. As
  such, all components (N) have at least one backup component (+1). In some
  cases, some components may have two backup components. The N+1 redundancy
  model is deployed in active-active components mode so the backup component is
  active in the operation even if all other components are fully functional.
  This is applied throughout GovCloud including network and data center
  implementation....

  000903: The organization obtains maintenance support and/or spare parts for
  organization-defined information system components within an
  organization-defined time period of failure.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed obtains maintenance support and/or
  spare parts for information system components defined in MA-6, CCI 2896 within
  24 hours (Low and Moderate Availability) or immediately upon failure for (High
  Availability). DoD has defined the time period as within 24 hours (Low and
  Moderate Availability) or immediately upon failure for (High Availability).
  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Maintenance support contracts, inventories of spare parts, etc.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains evidence that
  maintenance support is available for information system components defined in
  MA-6, CCI 2896 and that the support will be provided within 24 hours (Low and
  Moderate Availability) or immediately upon failure for (High Availability).
  Evidence can include maintenance support contracts, inventories of spare
  parts, etc. DoD has defined the time period as within 24 hours (Low and
  Moderate Availability) or immediately upon failure for (High Availability).
