  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Schedules, performs, documents, and reviews records of maintenance and
  repairs on information system components in accordance with manufacturer or
  vendor specifications and/or organizational requirements;

  b. Approves and monitors all maintenance activities, whether performed on site
  or remotely and whether the equipment is serviced on site or removed to
  another location;

  c. Requires that [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]
  explicitly approve the removal of the information system or system components
  from organizational facilities for off-site maintenance or repairs;

  d. Sanitizes equipment to remove all information from associated media prior
  to removal from organizational facilities for off-site maintenance or repairs;

  e. Checks all potentially impacted security controls to verify that the
  controls are still functioning properly following maintenance or repair
  actions; and

  f. Includes [Assignment: organization-defined maintenance-related information]
  in organizational maintenance records.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control addresses the information security aspects of the information
  system maintenance program and applies to all types of maintenance to any
  system component (including applications) conducted by any local or nonlocal
  entity (e.g., in-contract, warranty, in-house, software maintenance
  agreement). System maintenance also includes those components not directly
  associated with information processing and/or data/information retention such
  as scanners, copiers, and printers. Information necessary for creating
  effective maintenance records includes, for example: (i) date and time of
  maintenance; (ii) name of individuals or group performing the maintenance;
  (iii) name of escort, if necessary; (iv) a description of the maintenance
  performed; and (v) information system components/equipment removed or replaced
  (including identification numbers, if applicable). The level of detail
  included in maintenance records can be informed by the security categories of
  organizational information systems. Organizations consider supply chain issues
  associated with replacement components for information systems. Related
  controls: CM-3, CM-4, MA-4, MP-6, PE-16, SA-12, SI-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system maintenance policy; procedures
  addressing controlled information system maintenance; maintenance records;
  manufacturer/vendor maintenance specifications; equipment sanitization
  records; media sanitization records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  maintenance responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel responsible for media
  sanitization; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for scheduling, performing,
  documenting, reviewing, approving, and monitoring maintenance and repairs for
  the information system; organizational processes for sanitizing information
  system components; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  controlled maintenance; automated mechanisms implementing sanitization of
  information system components].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP
  Moderate Baseline, Rev 4

  AWS is responsible for scheduling, performing, documenting, and reviewing of
  records of maintenance and repairs on GovCloud components in accordance with
  manufacturer or vendor specifications where applicable, or in accordance with
  GovCloud operational requirements.


  AWS is also responsible for employing a Run to Fail maintenance standard for
  Infrastructure hardware, which consists of network devices and servers;
  controlling of all maintenance activities locally, within GovCloud
  datacenters; and prohibiting the removal of information system components for
  off-site maintenance or repairs....

  002876: The organization defines the maintenance-related information to
  include in organizational maintenance records.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the
  maintenance-related information to include in organizational maintenance
  records. DoD has determined the maintenance-related information is not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated maintenance procedures describing the maintenance
  information to be included in a maintenance record.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented maintenance-related information to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed defines the maintenance-related information to include in
  organizational maintenance records. DoD has determined the maintenance-related
  information is not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
