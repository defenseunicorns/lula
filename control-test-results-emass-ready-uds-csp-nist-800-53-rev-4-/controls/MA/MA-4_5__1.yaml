  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Requires the approval of each nonlocal maintenance session by [Assignment:
  organization-defined personnel or roles]; and

  (b) Notifies [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] of the date
  and time of planned nonlocal maintenance.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Notification may be performed by maintenance personnel. Approval of nonlocal
  maintenance sessions is accomplished by organizational personnel with
  sufficient information security and information system knowledge to determine
  the appropriateness of the proposed maintenance.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system maintenance policy; procedures
  addressing non-local information system maintenance; security plan;
  notifications supporting nonlocal maintenance sessions; maintenance records;
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  maintenance responsibilities; organizational personnel with notification
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with approval responsibilities;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for approving and notifying
  personnel regarding nonlocal maintenance; automated mechanisms supporting
  notification and approval of nonlocal maintenance].
