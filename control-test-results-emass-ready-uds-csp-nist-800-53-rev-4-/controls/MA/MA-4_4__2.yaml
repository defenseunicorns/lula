  Description:

  The organization protects nonlocal maintenance sessions by:

  (a) Employing [Assignment: organization-defined authenticators that are replay
  resistant]; and

  (b) Separating the maintenance sessions from other network sessions with the
  information system by either:

  (1) Physically separated communications paths; or

  (2) Logically separated communications paths based upon encryption.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related control: SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system maintenance policy; procedures
  addressing nonlocal information system maintenance; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; maintenance records; audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  maintenance responsibilities; network engineers; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for protecting nonlocal
  maintenance sessions; automated mechanisms implementing replay resistant
  authenticators; automated mechanisms implementing logically
  separated/encrypted communications paths].

  002887: The organization defines the authenticators that are replay resistant
  which will be employed to protect nonlocal maintenance sessions.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the
  authenticators that are replay resistant which will be employed to protect
  nonlocal maintenance sessions. DoD has determined the authenticators are not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation that details the remote maintenance and digital
  authenticators used for remote maintenance and digital sessions.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented authenticators to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  defines the authenticators that are replay resistant which will be employed to
  protect nonlocal maintenance sessions. DoD has determined the authenticators
  are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (All maintenance would be considered
  local maintenance as admins would either be provided by the organization or
  contracted.)
