  Description:

  The organization

  (a) Implements procedures for the use of maintenance personnel that lack
  appropriate security clearances or are not U.S. citizens, that include the
  following requirements:

  (1) Maintenance personnel who do not have needed access authorizations,
  clearances, or formal access approvals are escorted and supervised during the
  performance of maintenance and diagnostic activities on the information system
  by approved organizational personnel who are fully cleared, have appropriate
  access authorizations, and are technically qualified;

  (2) Prior to initiating maintenance or diagnostic activities by personnel who
  do not have needed access authorizations, clearances or formal access
  approvals, all volatile information storage components within the information
  system are sanitized and all nonvolatile storage media are removed or
  physically disconnected from the system and secured; and

  (b) Develops and implements alternate security safeguards in the event an
  information system component cannot be sanitized, removed, or disconnected
  from the system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement denies individuals who lack appropriate security
  clearances (i.e., individuals who do not possess security clearances or
  possess security clearances at a lower level than required) or who are not
  U.S. citizens, visual and electronic access to any classified information,
  Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), or any other sensitive information
  contained on organizational information systems. Procedures for the use of
  maintenance personnel can be documented in security plans for the information
  systems. Related controls: MP-6, PL-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system maintenance policy; procedures
  addressing maintenance personnel; information system media protection policy;
  physical and environmental protection policy; security plan; list of
  maintenance personnel requiring escort/supervision; maintenance records;
  access control records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  maintenance responsibilities; organizational personnel with personnel security
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with physical access control
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; organizational personnel responsible for media sanitization;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing maintenance
  personnel without appropriate access; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing alternative security safeguards; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing information storage component sanitization].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, but NOT included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP

  000894: The organization requires maintenance personnel who do not have needed
  access authorizations, clearances, or formal access approvals to be escorted
  and supervised during the performance of maintenance and diagnostic activities
  on the information system by approved organizational personnel who are fully
  cleared, have appropriate access authorizations, and are technically
  qualified.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed requires maintenance personnel who
  do not have needed access authorizations, clearances, or formal access
  approvals to be escorted and supervised during the performance of maintenance
  and diagnostic activities on the information system by approved organizational
  personnel who are fully cleared, have appropriate access authorizations, and
  are technically qualified. The organization must maintain records of
  maintenance personnel who access the system including information on escorts.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Policy that details escort procedures for uncleared maintenance workers
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  records of maintenance personnel who access the system to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed requires maintenance personnel who do
  not have needed access authorizations, clearances, or formal access approvals
  to be escorted and supervised during the performance of maintenance and
  diagnostic activities on the information system by approved organizational
  personnel who are fully cleared, have appropriate access authorizations, and
  are technically qualified.
