control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization checks media containing diagnostic and test programs for
  malicious code before the media are used in the information system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  If, upon inspection of media containing maintenance diagnostic and test
  programs, organizations determine that the media contain malicious code, the
  incident is handled consistent with organizational incident handling policies
  and procedures. Related control: SI-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system maintenance policy; procedures
  addressing information system maintenance tools; information system
  maintenance tools and associated documentation; maintenance records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  maintenance responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational process for inspecting media for malicious
  code; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing inspection of media
  used for maintenance].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP
  Moderate Baseline, Rev 4
control-implementation-status: Inherited
security-control-designation: Common
control-implementation-narrative: >-
  AWS does not permit portable external hard drives, disks, tapes, memory
  devices, or any other media inside data centers (see control MP-2.)
  Third-party contractors do not have logical access to any systems or data for
  maintenance purposes. Maintenance activities are conducted without the use of
  portable media. Therefore the control is not applicable....

  000870: The organization checks media containing diagnostic and test programs
  for malicious code before the media are used in the information system.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed:

  1. documents and implements procedures to check all media containing
  diagnostic and test programs for malicious code before the media are used in
  the information system; and

  2. Runs an automated tool set to check all media containing diagnostic and
  test programs for malicious code before the media are used in the information
  system.

  The organization must maintain configuration files for the automated tool set
  and audit logs of the tool set used to check media.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Policy that details how test digital media is verified to be free of
  malicious code prior to use on an information system
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  procedures for checking all diagnostic and test media for malicious code, and
  a sampling of configuration files and audit logs of the tool set used to check
  media. The purpose of the review is to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed checks all media containing diagnostic and test programs
  for malicious code before the media are used in the information system.
