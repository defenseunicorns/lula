  Description:

  The organization provides basic security awareness training to information
  system users (including managers, senior executives, and contractors):

  a. As part of initial training for new users;

  b. When required by information system changes; and

  c. [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] thereafter.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations determine the appropriate content of security awareness training
  and security awareness techniques based on the specific organizational
  requirements and the information systems to which personnel have authorized
  access. The content includes a basic understanding of the need for information
  security and user actions to maintain security and to respond to suspected
  security incidents. The content also addresses awareness of the need for
  operations security. Security awareness techniques can include, for example,
  displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed with security reminders,
  generating email advisories/notices from senior organizational officials,
  displaying logon screen messages, and conducting information security
  awareness events. Related controls: AT-3, AT-4, PL-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
