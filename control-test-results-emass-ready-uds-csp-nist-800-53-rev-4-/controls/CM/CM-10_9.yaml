family: CM
control-acronym: CM-10
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization

  a. Uses software and associated documentation in accordance with contract
  agreements and copyright laws;

  b. Tracks the use of software and associated documentation protected by
  quantity licenses to control copying and distribution; and

  c. Controls and documents the use of peer-to-peer file sharing technology to
  ensure that this capability is not used for the unauthorized distribution,
  display, performance, or reproduction of copyrighted work.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Software license tracking can be accomplished by manual methods (e.g., simple
  spreadsheets) or automated methods (e.g., specialized tracking applications)
  depending on organizational needs. Related controls: AC-17, CM-8, SC-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  software usage restrictions; configuration management plan; security plan;
  software contract agreements and copyright laws; site license documentation;
  list of software usage restrictions; software license tracking reports; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel
  operating, using, and/or maintaining the information system; organizational
  personnel with software license management responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational process for tracking the use of software
  protected by quantity licenses; organization process for
  controlling/documenting the use of peer-to-peer file sharing technology;
  automated mechanisms implementing software license tracking; automated
  mechanisms implementing and controlling the use of peer-to-peer files sharing
  technology].

  001732: The organization controls the use of peer-to-peer file sharing
  technology to ensure that this capability is not used for the unauthorized
  distribution, display, performance, or reproduction of copyrighted work.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed reviews and authorizes in order to
  control the use of peer-to-peer file sharing technology to ensure that this
  capability is not used for the unauthorized distribution, display,
  performance, or reproduction of copyrighted work. The organization must
  maintain an audit trail of peer-to-peer file sharing technology reviews and
  authorizations.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Copy of P2P ports being blocked by firewall

  2.) Copy of system security plan (SSP) policy referencing peer-to-peer file
  sharing technology section
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  audit trail of peer-to-peer file sharing technology reviews and authorizations
  to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed controls the use of
  peer-to-peer file sharing technology to ensure that this capability is not
  used for the unauthorized distribution, display, performance, or reproduction
  of copyrighted work.
