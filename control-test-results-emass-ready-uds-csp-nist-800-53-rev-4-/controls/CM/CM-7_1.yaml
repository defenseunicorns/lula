family: CM
control-acronym: CM-7
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Configures the information system to provide only essential capabilities;
  and

  b. Prohibits or restricts the use of the following functions, ports,
  protocols, and/or services: [Assignment: organization-defined prohibited or
  restricted functions, ports, protocols, and/or services].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information systems can provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some
  of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to
  support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions).
  Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from
  single information system components, but doing so increases risk over
  limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible,
  organizations limit component functionality to a single function per device
  (e.g., email servers or web servers, but not both). Organizations review
  functions and services provided by information systems or individual
  components of information systems, to determine which functions and services
  are candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant
  Messaging, auto-execute, and file sharing). Organizations consider disabling
  unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols (e.g., Universal
  Serial Bus, File Transfer Protocol, and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) on
  information systems to prevent unauthorized connection of devices,
  unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling. Organizations
  can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention
  systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based intrusion
  detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions,
  ports, protocols, and services. Related controls: AC-6, CM-2, RA-5, SA-5,
  SC-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; configuration
  management plan; procedures addressing least functionality in the information
  system; security plan; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; security
  configuration checklists; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes prohibiting or restricting
  functions, ports, protocols, and/or services; automated mechanisms
  implementing restrictions or prohibition of functions, ports, protocols,
  and/or services].

  The organization being inspected/assessed documents in the security plan,
  essential capabilities which the information system must provide. The
  organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  provide only those documented essential capabilities.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP)

  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  security plan to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed has
  identified essential capabilities. The organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment inspects the information system to ensure that it
  provides only those documented essential capabilities.

test-results: "UDS is designed with least functionality in mind only necessary services and software are installed. Each component of UDS (Istio, Keycloak, etc.) serves a purpose and there√¢\x80\x99s nothing extraneous running in the environment. Zarf packaging helps here: it packages only the required applications and their dependencies, so you're not including miscellaneous tools or bloat."
