family: CM
control-acronym: CM-1
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles]:

  1. A configuration management policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
  responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational
  entities, and compliance; and

  2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the configuration management
  policy and associated configuration management controls; and

  b. Reviews and updates the current:

  1. Configuration management policy [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency]; and

  2. Configuration management procedures [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
  effective implementation of selected security controls and control
  enhancements in the CM family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable
  federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
  and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization
  level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures
  unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information
  security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by
  multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The
  procedures can be established for the security program in general and for
  particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
  strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related
  control: PM-9.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].

  001825: The organization disseminates to organization defined personnel or
  roles the procedures to facilitate the implementation of the configuration
  management policy and associated configuration management controls.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed disseminates the procedures to
  facilitate the implementation of the configuration management policy and
  associated configuration management controls via an information sharing
  capability (e.g. portal, intranet, email, etc.) to all stakeholders in the
  configuration management process.


  DoD has defined the organizational personnel or roles as all stakeholders in
  the configuration management process.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) List of personnel to whom the configuration management policy is to be
  disseminated.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  procedures to facilitate the implementation of the configuration management
  policy and associated configuration management controls via the inspected
  organization's information sharing capability (e.g. portal, intranet, email,
  etc.) to ensure it has been disseminated.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The UDS technology stack does not
  create or document configuration management policies, as this is a
  policy-driven activity. The responsibility for developing, documenting, and
  disseminating a configuration management policy, as well as associated
  procedures, lies with the organization. However, UDS provides tools to assist
  in conducting configuration management. This includes the UDS CLI and
  utilizing Zarf as delivery methods for the UDS technology stack itself. These
  tools support the implementation of configuration management practices by
  enabling efficient deployment and management of the UDS components. While the
  UDS platform provides these technical capabilities, the strategic planning,
  execution, and documentation of configuration management policies and
  procedures are managed by Mission Hero, ensuring alignment with organizational
  requirements and security policies.)
