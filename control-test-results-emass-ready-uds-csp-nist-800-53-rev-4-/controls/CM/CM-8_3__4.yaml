family: CM
control-acronym: CM-8(3)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Employs automated mechanisms [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]
  to detect the presence of unauthorized hardware, software, and firmware
  components within the information system; and

  (b) Takes the following actions when unauthorized components are detected:
  [Selection (one or more): disables network access by such components; isolates
  the components; notifies [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
  roles]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement is applied in addition to the monitoring for
  unauthorized remote connections and mobile devices. Monitoring for
  unauthorized system components may be accomplished on an ongoing basis or by
  the periodic scanning of systems for that purpose. Automated mechanisms can be
  implemented within information systems or in other separate devices. Isolation
  can be achieved, for example, by placing unauthorized information system
  components in separate domains or subnets or otherwise quarantining such
  components. This type of component isolation is commonly referred to as
  sandboxing. Related controls: AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, CA-7, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7,
  RA-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  information system component inventory; configuration management plan;
  security plan; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; information system
  inventory records; alerts/notifications of unauthorized components within the
  information system; information system monitoring records; change control
  records; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  managing the automated mechanisms implementing unauthorized information system
  component detection; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for detection of unauthorized
  information system components; automated mechanisms implementing the detection
  of unauthorized information system components].

cci: 1784
cci-definition: >-
  001784: When unauthorized hardware, software, and firmware components are
  detected within the system, take action to disable network access by such
  components; isolate the components, and/or notify organization-defined
  personnel or roles.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to take action to disable network access by unauthorized software, hardware,
  and firmware components, isolate the components, and/or notify the ISSO and
  ISSM and others as the local organization deems appropriate. The organization
  must maintain an audit trail of actions taken upon detection of unauthorized
  software, hardware, and firmware components. DoD has defined the personnel or
  roles as the ISSO and ISSM and others as the local organization deems
  appropriate.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated continuous monitoring policy
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented process and audit trail for taking action upon detection of
  unauthorized components to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  takes action to disable network access by unauthorized software, hardware, and
  firmware components, isolate the components, and/or notify the ISSO and ISSM
  and others as the local organization deems appropriate. DoD has defined the
  personnel or roles as the ISSO and ISSM and others as the local organization
  deems appropriate.
