control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization limits privileges to change software resident within software
  libraries.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Software libraries include privileged programs. Related control: AC-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  access restrictions for changes to the information system; configuration
  management plan; information system design documentation; information system
  architecture and configuration documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; change control records; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing access restrictions
  to change; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing access
  restrictions for change].

  001499: The organization limits privileges to change software resident within
  software libraries.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to limit privileges to accounts authorized to change software resident within
  software libraries. For information system components that have applicable
  STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the
  STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 1499.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation that defines a process to limit privileges
  to accounts authorized to change software resident within software libraries

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented process to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed limits
  privileges to change software resident within software libraries. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 1499.

test-results: >-
  In UDS, privileges to change software resident within software libraries are
  strictly controlled through an immutable, version-controlled deployment
  pipeline. Software libraries are packaged into container images via Zarf and
  managed as code through OpenTofu, ensuring that any modifications require
  authorized changes to the source code subject to formal code reviews and
  approvals rather than direct alteration in production. The immutable nature of
  container images, combined with robust RBAC enforced by Kubernetes and
  Keycloak, prevents unauthorized modifications, while cryptographic signing
  verifies the integrity of the software libraries. This structured process
  ensures that only a limited set of authorized personnel can update software
  libraries, maintaining their integrity and minimizing the risk of malicious
  changes.
