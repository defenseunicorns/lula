family: CM
control-acronym: CM-3(2)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization tests, validates, and documents changes to the information
  system before implementing the changes on the operational system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Changes to information systems include modifications to hardware, software, or
  firmware components and configuration settings defined in CM-6. Organizations
  ensure that testing does not interfere with information system operations.
  Individuals/groups conducting tests understand organizational security
  policies and procedures, information system security policies and procedures,
  and the specific health, safety, and environmental risks associated with
  particular facilities/processes. Operational systems may need to be taken
  off-line, or replicated to the extent feasible, before testing can be
  conducted. If information systems must be taken off-line for testing, the
  tests are scheduled to occur during planned system outages whenever possible.
  If testing cannot be conducted on operational systems, organizations employ
  compensating controls (e.g., testing on replicated systems).


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; configuration
  management plan; procedures addressing information system configuration change
  control; information system design documentation; information system
  architecture and configuration documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; test records; validation records;
  change control records; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration change
  control responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for configuration change control;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing testing, validating, and
  documenting information system changes].

  000327: The organization tests changes to the information system before
  implementing the changes on the operational system.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to test changes to the information system before implementing the changes on
  the operational system. The organization must maintain an audit trail of
  testing activity.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Change management testing procedures
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented process as well as the audit trail of testing activity to ensure
  the organization being inspected/assessed tests changes to the information
  system before implementing the changes on the operational system.

  UDS ensures thorough testing of all information system changes prior to
  deployment into operational environments. Leveraging Infrastructure as Code
  (IaC) with OpenTofu, alongside secure software delivery through signed Zarf
  packages, UDS provides standardized, repeatable, and isolated environments
  (such as dedicated staging or testing environments) where system and software
  configuration changes are rigorously tested before production deployment.
