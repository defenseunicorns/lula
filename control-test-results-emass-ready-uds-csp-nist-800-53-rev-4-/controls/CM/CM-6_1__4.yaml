  Description:

  The organization employs automated mechanisms to centrally manage, apply, and
  verify configuration settings for [Assignment: organization-defined
  information system components].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related controls: CA-7, CM-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  configuration settings for the information system; configuration management
  plan; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; security configuration
  checklists; change control records; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing configuration
  settings; automated mechanisms implemented to centrally manage, apply, and
  verify information system configuration settings].

  002059: The organization defines the information system components for which
  the organization will employ automated mechanisms to centrally manage, apply,
  and verify configuration settings.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the
  information system components for which the organization will employ automated
  mechanisms to centrally manage, apply, and verify configuration settings. DoD
  has determined the information system components are not appropriate to define
  at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation that identifies the information system components for which
  the organization will employ automated mechanisms to centrally manage, apply,
  and verify configuration settings
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examine the
  documented information system components to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed defines the information system components for which the
  organization will employ automated mechanisms to centrally manage, apply, and
  verify configuration settings. DoD has determined the information system
  components are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  UDS platform inherently supports automated mechanisms to centrally manage,
  apply, and verify configuration settings across its critical system
  components, including Kubernetes clusters, the Istio Service Mesh, Keycloak
  identity management, containerized applications, and associated DevSecOps
  infrastructure. Configuration management is conducted through Infrastructure
  as Code (IaC) using OpenTofu, combined with secure software distribution via
  Zarf packages. Policy enforcement is provided by Pepr, which ensures
  continuous verification and enforcement of configuration compliance.
