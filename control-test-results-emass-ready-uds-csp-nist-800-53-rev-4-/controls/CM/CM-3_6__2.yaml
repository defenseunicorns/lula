control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization ensures that cryptographic mechanisms used to provide
  [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] are under configuration
  management.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Regardless of the cryptographic means employed (e.g., public key, private key,
  shared secrets), organizations ensure that there are processes and procedures
  in place to effectively manage those means. For example, if devices use
  certificates as a basis for identification and authentication, there needs to
  be a process in place to address the expiration of those certificates. Related
  control: SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  information system configuration change control; configuration management
  plan; security plan; information system design documentation; information
  system architecture and configuration documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration change
  control responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for configuration change control;
  cryptographic mechanisms implementing organizational security safeguards].

  001746: The organization ensures that cryptographic mechanisms used to provide
  organization-defined security safeguards are under configuration management.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed ensures that cryptographic
  mechanisms used to provide all security safeguards are under configuration
  management. DoD has defined the security safeguards as all security
  safeguards.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Configuration management policy which documents the
  cryptographic mechanisms used to provide all security safeguards
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  configuration management policy to ensure that cryptographic mechanisms used
  to provide all security safeguards are documented in the policy. DoD has
  defined the security safeguards as all security safeguards.

  UDS ensures cryptographic mechanisms providing organizational security
  safeguards are strictly controlled under configuration management through
  Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using OpenTofu, and secure deployment practices
  via signed Zarf packages. Cryptographic settings including TLS certificates,
  mutual TLS (mTLS) configurations within Istio Service Mesh, and identity
  provider certificates managed by Keycloak are version-controlled, explicitly
  documented, and securely managed to prevent unauthorized modifications. The
  UDS technology stack utilizes FIPS modules in the underlying container images
  to aid in encryption. These cryptographic mechanisms are under configuration
  management and typically reference a repository that has the image marked as
  FIPS, ensuring that they are effectively managed and documented.
