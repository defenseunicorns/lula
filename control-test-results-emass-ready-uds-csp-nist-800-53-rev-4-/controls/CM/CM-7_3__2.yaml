  Description:

  The organization ensures compliance with [Assignment: organization-defined
  registration requirements for functions, ports, protocols, and services].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations use the registration process to manage, track, and provide
  oversight for information systems and implemented functions, ports, protocols,
  and services.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  least functionality in the information system; configuration management plan;
  security plan; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; audit and compliance reviews; information system audit records;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes ensuring compliance with
  registration requirements for functions, ports, protocols, and/or services;
  automated mechanisms implementing compliance with registration requirements
  for functions, ports, protocols, and/or services].

  The organization being inspected/assessed implements DoDI 8551.01. DoD has
  defined the registration requirements as IAW DoDI 8551.01.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) List of ports, protocols, and services in use
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines a
  documented listing of ports, protocols, and services in use, and reviews a
  sampling of those ports, protocols, and services to ensure the organization
  being inspected/assessed is compliant with DoDI 8551.01. DoD has defined the
  registration requirements as IAW DoDI 8551.01.

  UDS ensures compliance with organizationally defined registration requirements
  for functions, ports, protocols, and services through its integrated
  infrastructure management and policy enforcement capabilities. Specifically,
  the platform leverages Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices via OpenTofu to
  explicitly define and provision approved network configurations. The Istio
  Service Mesh enforces these definitions, strictly controlling and monitoring
  network communications, ports, protocols, and inter-service interactions.
  Istio explicitly controls and provides observability into network
  communications, clearly defining allowable protocols, ports, and services.
  Istio's telemetry data (accessible via Prometheus and Grafana) allows
  administrators to monitor network traffic and enforce policy compliance.
  Together, these tools offer detailed metrics and visualizations of the PPS
  usage across Kubernetes clusters. Grafana dashboards visualize active network
  services, resource endpoints, traffic patterns, and anomalies. By aggregating
  container and system logs, Vector and Loki provide audit trails and detailed
  records of PPS usage, facilitating compliance monitoring and forensic
  analysis.
