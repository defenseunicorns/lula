family: CM
control-acronym: CM-3(2)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization tests, validates, and documents changes to the information
  system before implementing the changes on the operational system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Changes to information systems include modifications to hardware, software, or
  firmware components and configuration settings defined in CM-6. Organizations
  ensure that testing does not interfere with information system operations.
  Individuals/groups conducting tests understand organizational security
  policies and procedures, information system security policies and procedures,
  and the specific health, safety, and environmental risks associated with
  particular facilities/processes. Operational systems may need to be taken
  off-line, or replicated to the extent feasible, before testing can be
  conducted. If information systems must be taken off-line for testing, the
  tests are scheduled to occur during planned system outages whenever possible.
  If testing cannot be conducted on operational systems, organizations employ
  compensating controls (e.g., testing on replicated systems).


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; configuration
  management plan; procedures addressing information system configuration change
  control; information system design documentation; information system
  architecture and configuration documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; test records; validation records;
  change control records; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration change
  control responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for configuration change control;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing testing, validating, and
  documenting information system changes].

  000328: The organization validates changes to the information system before
  implementing the changes on the operational system.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to validate changes to the information system before implementing the changes
  on the operational system. The organization must maintain an audit trail of
  validation activity.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Change management testing procedures
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented process as well as the audit trail of validation activity to ensure
  the organization being inspected/assessed validates changes to the information
  system before implementing the changes on the operational system.

  UDS fully supports validation of information system changes prior to
  operational deployment. Leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) through
  OpenTofu and secure software deployments via signed Zarf packages, UDS ensures
  that all proposed system changes are consistently documented, validated, and
  version-controlled in dedicated pre-production environments. Automated
  security compliance checks and validations provided by Pepr ensure that
  proposed changes align with established organizational baselines and security
  policies before reaching the operational environment. Additionally, detailed
  audit trails provided by Vector and Loki record all validation activities,
  facilitating review and compliance audits. Collectively, these capabilities
  fully satisfy the requirement to validate all system changes prior to
  implementation in the operational environment.
