  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Determines the types of changes to the information system that are
  configuration-controlled;

  b. Reviews proposed configuration-controlled changes to the information system
  and approves or disapproves such changes with explicit consideration for
  security impact analyses;

  c. Documents configuration change decisions associated with the information
  system;

  d. Implements approved configuration-controlled changes to the information
  system;

  e. Retains records of configuration-controlled changes to the information
  system for [Assignment: organization-defined time period];

  f. Audits and reviews activities associated with configuration-controlled
  changes to the information system; and

  g. Coordinates and provides oversight for configuration change control
  activities through [Assignment: organization-defined configuration change
  control element (e.g., committee, board)] that convenes [Selection (one or
  more): [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; [Assignment:
  organization-defined configuration change conditions]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Configuration change controls for organizational information systems involve
  the systematic proposal, justification, implementation, testing, review, and
  disposition of changes to the systems, including system upgrades and
  modifications. Configuration change control includes changes to baseline
  configurations for components and configuration items of information systems,
  changes to configuration settings for information technology products (e.g.,
  operating systems, applications, firewalls, routers, and mobile devices),
  unscheduled/unauthorized changes, and changes to remediate vulnerabilities.
  Typical processes for managing configuration changes to information systems
  include, for example, Configuration Control Boards that approve proposed
  changes to systems. For new development information systems or systems
  undergoing major upgrades, organizations consider including representatives
  from development organizations on the Configuration Control Boards. Auditing
  of changes includes activities before and after changes are made to
  organizational information systems and the auditing activities required to
  implement such changes. Related controls: CA-7, CM-2, CM-4, CM-5, CM-6, CM-9,
  SA-10, SI-2, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  information system configuration change control; configuration management
  plan; information system architecture and configuration documentation;
  security plan; change control records; information system audit records;
  change control audit and review reports; agenda /minutes from configuration
  change control oversight meetings; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration change
  control responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; members of change control
  board or similar].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for configuration change control;
  automated mechanisms that implement configuration change control].

  000313: The organization determines the types of changes to the information
  system that are configuration controlled.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed determines the types of changes to
  the information system that are to be configuration controlled. This action
  will be implemented by the CCB as defined in CM-3, CCI 1586.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated configuration management policies
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  configuration management policy and plan to ensure the organization identifies
  the types of changes to the information system that are configuration
  controlled.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The UDS technology stack provides
  tools to assist with configuration management, but the determination of the
  types of changes to the information system that are configuration-controlled
  is the responsibility of the organization.)
