  Description:

  The information system enforces access restrictions and supports auditing of
  the enforcement actions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related controls: AU-2, AU-12, AU-6, CM-3, CM-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  access restrictions for changes to the information system; information system
  design documentation; information system architecture and configuration
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; change control records; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing access restrictions
  to change; automated mechanisms implementing enforcement of access
  restrictions for changes to the information system; automated mechanisms
  supporting auditing of enforcement actions].

  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to enforce access restrictions provided by the information system.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation of a process to enforce access restrictions

  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented process as well as the configuration of the information system to
  ensure access restrictions are implemented.

  UDS effectively enforces access restrictions throughout the platform using
  multiple integrated technical mechanisms. Centralized authentication and
  authorization are managed by Keycloak, ensuring strict enforcement of user and
  role-based access controls. Kubernetes RBAC explicitly restricts permissions
  for users, applications, and services within the cluster environment, limiting
  access strictly to authorized resources and actions. Istio Service Mesh
  enhances this enforcement through fine-grained authorization policies and
  mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication, strictly controlling service-to-service
  communications. Additionally, the policy enforcement engine Pepr and runtime
  monitoring by NeuVector proactively detect and prevent unauthorized access
  attempts or policy deviations, ensuring continuous enforcement of access
  restrictions. These comprehensive security measures collectively fulfill the
  intent of this control.
