family: CM
control-acronym: CM-7(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Reviews the information system [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency] to identify unnecessary and/or nonsecure functions, ports,
  protocols, and services; and

  (b) Disables [Assignment: organization-defined functions, ports, protocols,
  and services within the information system deemed to be unnecessary and/or
  nonsecure].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The organization can either make a determination of the relative security of
  the function, port, protocol, and/or service or base the security decision on
  the assessment of other entities. Bluetooth, FTP, and peer-to-peer networking
  are examples of less than secure protocols. Related controls: AC-18, CM-7,
  IA-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  least functionality in the information system; configuration management plan;
  security plan; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; security configuration
  checklists; documented reviews of functions, ports, protocols, and/or
  services; change control records; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  reviewing functions, ports, protocols, and services on the information system;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for reviewing/disabling nonsecure
  functions, ports, protocols, and/or services; automated mechanisms
  implementing review and disabling of nonsecure functions, ports, protocols,
  and/or services].

  001761: The organization defines the functions, ports, protocols and services
  within the information system that are to be disabled when deemed unnecessary
  and/or nonsecure.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed must define and document in the
  system security plan, the functions, ports, protocols and services within the
  information system that are to be disabled when deemed unnecessary. DoD has
  determined that it is not appropriate to define unnecessary functions, ports,
  protocols and service at the Enterprise level. Nonsecure functions, ports,
  protocols and services are defined in DoDI 8551.01.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Disapproved ports, protocols, and/or services list
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  system security plan to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  defines the functions, ports, protocols and services within the information
  system that are to be disabled when deemed unnecessary. DoD has determined
  that it is not appropriate to define unnecessary functions, ports, protocols
  and service at the Enterprise level. Nonsecure functions, ports, protocols and
  services are defined in DoDI 8551.01.

test-results: >-
  UDS leverages Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via OpenTofu and secure deployments
  using Zarf packages, enabling centralized control and definition of allowable
  services, ports, protocols, and network access within Kubernetes clusters. The
  Istio Service Mesh further enforces these definitions by explicitly allowing
  only approved communications between microservices, automatically blocking
  undefined or unauthorized protocols, ports, and network pathways. Although UDS
  inherently supports enforcing strict control of services, ports, and network
  configurations, explicitly defining acceptable and unacceptable components
  including ports, services, and protocols is an organizational policy decision
  to configure.
