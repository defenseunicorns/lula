  Description:

  The organization ensures compliance with [Assignment: organization-defined
  registration requirements for functions, ports, protocols, and services].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations use the registration process to manage, track, and provide
  oversight for information systems and implemented functions, ports, protocols,
  and services.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  least functionality in the information system; configuration management plan;
  security plan; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; audit and compliance reviews; information system audit records;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes ensuring compliance with
  registration requirements for functions, ports, protocols, and/or services;
  automated mechanisms implementing compliance with registration requirements
  for functions, ports, protocols, and/or services].
