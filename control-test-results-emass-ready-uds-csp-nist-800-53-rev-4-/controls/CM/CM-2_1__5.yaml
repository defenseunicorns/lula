control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization reviews and updates the baseline configuration of the
  information system:

  (a) [Assignment: organization-defined frequency];

  (b) When required due to [Assignment organization-defined circumstances]; and

  (c) As an integral part of information system component installations and
  upgrades.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related control: CM-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; configuration
  management plan; procedures addressing the baseline configuration of the
  information system; procedures addressing information system component
  installations and upgrades; information system architecture and configuration
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; records of information system baseline configuration reviews
  and updates; information system component installations/upgrades and
  associated records; change control records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing baseline
  configurations; automated mechanisms supporting review and update of the
  baseline configuration].

  000298: The organization reviews and updates the baseline configuration of the
  information system as an integral part of information system component
  installations.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed reviews and updates the baseline
  configuration of the information system as an integral part of information
  system component installations. The organization must document each occurrence
  of the reviews and update actions as an audit trail.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated configuration management policy referencing section with
  reviews and updates to baseline configuration
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines
  documentation of organizational reviews and update actions for the baseline
  configuration of the information system as an integral part of information
  system component installations to ensure review and necessary updates are
  occurring.

test-results: >-
  UDS inherently ensures baseline configurations are reviewed, updated, and
  maintained as an integral part of every information system component
  installation through its Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach using OpenTofu,
  combined with secure, version-controlled software and infrastructure
  deployment via signed Zarf packages. Each time new components, updates, or
  patches are installed, the baseline configuration is automatically documented,
  version-controlled, and updated accordingly. Automated enforcement by Pepr
  further ensure these configurations remain consistent and accurately reflect
  current system state, promptly detecting deviations or unauthorized changes.
  Collectively, these mechanisms ensure baseline configuration management is
  seamlessly integrated into system component installations, fully satisfying
  the intent of this control.
