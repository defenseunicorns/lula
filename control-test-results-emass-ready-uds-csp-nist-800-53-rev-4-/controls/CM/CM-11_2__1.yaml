  Description:

  The information system prohibits user installation of software without
  explicit privileged status


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Privileged status can be obtained, for example, by serving in the role of
  system administrator. Related control: AC-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  user installed software; configuration management plan; security plan;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; alerts/notifications of unauthorized
  software installations; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  governing user-installed software; organizational personnel operating, using,
  and/or maintaining the information system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes governing user-installed software
  on the information system; automated mechanisms for prohibiting installation
  of software without privileged status (e.g., access controls)].

  001812: The information system prohibits user installation of software without
  explicit privileged status.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed must configure the information
  system to prevent the installation of software by non-privileged users. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 1812.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  configuration of the information system components to ensure that installation
  of software without explicit privileged status is prohibited. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization
  conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that
  the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the information
  system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI
  1812.

test-results: >-
  UDS explicitly prohibits software installation by users lacking explicit
  privileged status through robust security mechanisms. Specifically, software
  deployments and installations are managed centrally via Infrastructure as Code
  (IaC) using OpenTofu and signed Zarf packages, ensuring only explicitly
  authorized users or processes with defined privileges can deploy or install
  software components. Privilege enforcement is strictly controlled by identity
  and access management through Keycloak, ensuring only authorized, privileged
  users can approve or execute software installations.
