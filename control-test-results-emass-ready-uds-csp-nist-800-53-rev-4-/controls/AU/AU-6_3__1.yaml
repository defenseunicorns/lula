  Description:

  The organization analyzes and correlates audit records across different
  repositories to gain organization-wide situational awareness.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organization-wide situational awareness includes awareness across all three
  tiers of risk management (i.e., organizational, mission/business process, and
  information system) and supports cross-organization awareness. Related
  controls: AU-12, IR-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit review, analysis, and reporting; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records across different repositories;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit review, analysis,
  and reporting responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting analysis and correlation
  of audit records].

  000153: The organization analyzes and correlates audit records across
  different repositories to gain organization-wide situational awareness.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to analyze and correlate audit records across different repositories to gain
  organization-wide situational awareness. The organization must maintain a
  record of the analysis.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Record of the analysis of correlation of audit records across different
  repositories
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented process as well as the record of analysis to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed analyzes and correlates audit records
  across different repositories to gain organization-wide situational awareness.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Cross organizational situational
  awareness by correlating audit records from different repositories would need
  to be accomplished at the organizational level.)
