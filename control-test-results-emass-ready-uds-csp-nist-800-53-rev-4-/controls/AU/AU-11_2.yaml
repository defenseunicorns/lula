  Description:

  The organization retains audit records for [Assignment: organization-defined
  time period consistent with records retention policy] to provide support for
  after-the-fact investigations of security incidents and to meet regulatory and
  organizational information retention requirements.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations retain audit records until it is determined that they are no
  longer needed for administrative, legal, audit, or other operational purposes.
  This includes, for example, retention and availability of audit records
  relative to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, subpoenas, and law
  enforcement actions. Organizations develop standard categories of audit
  records relative to such types of actions and standard response processes for
  each type of action. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)
  General Records Schedules provide federal policy on record retention. Related
  controls: AU-4, AU-5, AU-9, MP-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
