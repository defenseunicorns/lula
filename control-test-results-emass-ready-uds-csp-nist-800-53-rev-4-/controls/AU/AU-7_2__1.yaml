  Description:

  The information system provides the capability to sort and search audit
  records for events of interest based on the content of [Assignment:
  organization-defined audit fields within audit records].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Sorting and searching of audit records may be based upon the contents of audit
  record fields, for example: (i) date/time of events; (ii) user identifiers;
  (iii) Internet Protocol (IP) addresses involved in the event; (iv) type of
  event; or (v) event success/failure.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit reduction and report generation; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; audit reduction, review, analysis, and reporting tools; audit
  record criteria (fields) establishing events of interest; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit reduction and
  report generation responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Audit reduction and report generation capability].

  001884: The organization defines the audit fields within audit records to be
  sorted for events of interest by the information system.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed must define and document the audit
  fields within audit records to be sorted for events of interest by the
  information system. DoD has determined that the audit fields are not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy

  2.) Example of audit log report based on events of interest
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented audit fields to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  defines the audit fields within audit records to be sorted for events of
  interest by the information system. DoD has determined that the audit fields
  are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  UDS provides robust capabilities to capture and sort audit records through its
  integrated logging and analytics solutions (Vector, Loki, and Grafana). These
  tools allow administrators to explicitly define and sort audit fields
  including user identities, timestamps, event types, actions performed, and
  authentication outcomes to rapidly identify and investigate events of
  interest. Audit logs can be efficiently filtered, sorted, and displayed via
  Grafana dashboards, providing clear visibility into significant security
  events. However, the specific audit fields to be sorted for events of interest
  must be explicitly defined by the administrator or cybersecurity team.
