  Description:

  The organization allocates audit record storage capacity in accordance with
  [Assignment: organization-defined audit record storage requirements].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations consider the types of auditing to be performed and the audit
  processing requirements when allocating audit storage capacity. Allocating
  sufficient audit storage capacity reduces the likelihood of such capacity
  being exceeded and resulting in the potential loss or reduction of auditing
  capability. Related controls: AU-2, AU-5, AU-6, AU-7, AU-11, SI-4.

  Related Controls: AR-4, AU-5(1), AU-9, AU-9(2), AU-11.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit storage capacity; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; audit record
  storage requirements; audit record storage capability for information system
  components; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Audit record storage capacity and related configuration
  settings].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] Privacy (Confidentiality Impact Level: Moderate) Overlay:
  Adequate storage capacity for logs used to audit privacy-related controls
  reduces the likelihood of the logs exceeding available storage space and
  potentially losing log information or reducing auditing capability. Audit
  information could be necessary to enforce criminal or civil penalties under
  the Privacy Act, and providing adequate storage capacity allows for preserving
  complete audit information for these purposes.

  001849: Allocate audit log storage capacity to accommodate
  organization-defined audit record retention requirements.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed allocates, and configures the
  information system to allocate audit record storage capacity as defined in
  AU-4, CCI 1848. For information system components that have applicable STIGs
  or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the
  STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 1849.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks

  2.) Documentation that shows the information system provides a warning when
  allocated audit record storage volume reaches a maximum (organization-defined
  percentage)
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured
  the information system to allocate audit record storage capacity as defined in
  AU-4, CCI 1848. For information system components that have applicable STIGs
  or SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the
  components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 1849.
