family: AU
control-acronym: AU-5
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system:

  a. Alerts [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] in the event
  of an audit processing failure; and

  b. Takes the following additional actions: [Assignment: organization-defined
  actions to be taken (e.g., shut down information system, overwrite oldest
  audit records, stop generating audit records)].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit processing failures include, for example, software/hardware errors,
  failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being
  reached or exceeded. Organizations may choose to define additional actions for
  different audit processing failures (e.g., by type, by location, by severity,
  or a combination of such factors). This control applies to each audit data
  storage repository (i.e., distinct information system component where audit
  records are stored), the total audit storage capacity of organizations (i.e.,
  all audit data storage repositories combined), or both. Related controls:
  AU-4, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  response to audit processing failures; information system design
  documentation; security plan; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; list of personnel to be notified in case of an audit
  processing failure; information system audit records; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing information system
  response to audit processing failures].

  001490: The organization defines actions to be taken by the information system
  upon audit failure (e.g., shut down information system, overwrite oldest audit
  records, stop generating audit records).
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will define and document actions to
  be taken by the information system upon audit failure. The organization shall
  consider trade-offs between the needs for system availability and audit
  integrity when defining the actions. Unless availability is an overriding
  concern, the default action should be to shut down the information system. DoD
  has determined that the actions are not appropriate to define at the
  Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented actions to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed has
  defined the actions to be taken by the information system upon audit failure.
  DoD has determined that the actions are not appropriate to define at the
  Enterprise level.

  that are required to me taken within UDS.)
