control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system backs up audit records [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] onto a physically different system or system
  component than the system or component being audited.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement helps to ensure that a compromise of the information
  system being audited does not also result in a compromise of the audit
  records. Related controls: AU-4, AU-5, AU-11.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  protection of audit information; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation, system
  or media storing backups of information system audit records; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing the backing up of audit
  records].

  001575: The organization defines the system or system component for storing
  audit records that is a different system or system component other than the
  system or component being audited.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents a system or
  storage media that will be used to store information system audit data
  different and separate from the system or media generating the audit data.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy

  2.) Example of information system backs up audit records at least weekly onto
  a different system or media than the system being audited.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  information system or media documentation addressing the storage of backups of
  information system audit records; information system audit records; and any
  other relevant documents or records. The purpose of the reviews is to ensure
  the organization has defined and documented a system or storage media
  different from the system or media being audited.
