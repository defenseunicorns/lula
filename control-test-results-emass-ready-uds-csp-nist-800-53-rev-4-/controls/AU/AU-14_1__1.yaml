  Description:

  The information system initiates session audits at system start-up.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  user session auditing; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing user session auditing
  capability].

cci-definition: '001464: The information system initiates session audits at system start-up.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  initiate session audits at system start-up. For information system components
  that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed
  must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 1464.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to initiate session audits at system start-up. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 1464.

  The UDS platform is configured to initiate session audits at system start-up,
  ensuring that all relevant session activities are logged from the beginning of
  system operation. This capability is implemented across all components of the
  UDS platform, including Keycloak, Kubernetes, and NeuVector. Upon start-up,
  these components generate audit logs that capture session initiation and other
  relevant activities. The logs are collected using Vector and aggregated in
  Loki, providing a centralized repository for audit records. These logs can be
  visualized and analyzed in Grafana, offering insights into session activities
  and ensuring that session audits are conducted consistently from system
  start-up.
