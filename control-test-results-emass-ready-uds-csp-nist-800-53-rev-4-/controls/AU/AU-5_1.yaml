family: AU
control-acronym: AU-5
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system:

  a. Alerts [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] in the event
  of an audit processing failure; and

  b. Takes the following additional actions: [Assignment: organization-defined
  actions to be taken (e.g., shut down information system, overwrite oldest
  audit records, stop generating audit records)].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit processing failures include, for example, software/hardware errors,
  failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being
  reached or exceeded. Organizations may choose to define additional actions for
  different audit processing failures (e.g., by type, by location, by severity,
  or a combination of such factors). This control applies to each audit data
  storage repository (i.e., distinct information system component where audit
  records are stored), the total audit storage capacity of organizations (i.e.,
  all audit data storage repositories combined), or both. Related controls:
  AU-4, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  response to audit processing failures; information system design
  documentation; security plan; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; list of personnel to be notified in case of an audit
  processing failure; information system audit records; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing information system
  response to audit processing failures].

cci: 139
cci-definition: >-
  000139: The information system alerts designated organization-defined
  personnel or roles in the event of an audit processing failure.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  alert at a minimum, the SCA and ISSO in the event of an audit processing
  failure. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs,
  the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG
  guidance that pertains to CCI 139. DoD has defined the personnel or roles as
  at a minimum, the SCA and ISSO. Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system to alert at a minimum, the SCA and ISSO in the event of an
  audit processing failure. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 139. DoD has defined the
  personnel or roles as at a minimum, the SCA and ISSO.

test-results: "This control deals with responses to audit logging failures (such as running out of log space or logger crashing). The UDS stack uses Loki and Vector which are both typically run as highly available components. If Loki becomes unavailable or its volume is full, Vector (the log shipping agent) can buffer a certain amount of logs in memory/disk. This is not infinite, but it provides a window for recovery. The stack itself won't shut down the system if logging fails (UDS doesnâ\x80\x99t halt applications for logger issues by default). However, you can configure monitoring e.g., Prometheus can watch Lokiâ\x80\x99s health and send an alert if itâ\x80\x99s down or if log volume usage is critical. An administrator could then intervene (increase storage or restart components). Detection and alerting of logging failures is achievable with the monitoring tools included."
