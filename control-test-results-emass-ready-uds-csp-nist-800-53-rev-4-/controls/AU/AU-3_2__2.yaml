control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system provides centralized management and configuration of
  the content to be captured in audit records generated by [Assignment:
  organization-defined information system components].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement requires that the content to be captured in audit
  records be configured from a central location (necessitating automation).
  Organizations coordinate the selection of required audit content to support
  the centralized management and configuration capability provided by the
  information system. Related controls: AU-6, AU-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  content of audit records; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; list of
  organization-defined auditable events; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Information system capability implementing centralized
  management and configuration of audit record content].
