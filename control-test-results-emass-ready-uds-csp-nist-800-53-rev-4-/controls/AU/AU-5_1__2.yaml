control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system provides a warning to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel, roles, and/or locations] within [Assignment: organization-defined
  time period] when allocated audit record storage volume reaches [Assignment:
  organization-defined percentage] of repository maximum audit record storage
  capacity.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations may have multiple audit data storage repositories distributed
  across multiple information system components, with each repository having
  different storage volume capacities.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  response to audit processing failures; information system design
  documentation; security plan; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing audit storage limit
  warnings].

  001853: The organization defines the time period within which
  organization-defined personnel, roles and/or location are to receive warnings
  when allocated audit record storage volume reaches a organization-defined
  percentage of maximum audit records storage capacity.

  DoD has defined the time period as immediate.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:
  Automatically Compliant

  The organization being inspected/assessed is automatically compliant with this
  CCI because they are covered at the DoD level. DoD has defined the time period
  as immediate.
