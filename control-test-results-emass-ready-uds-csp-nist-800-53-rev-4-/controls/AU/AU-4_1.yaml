  Description:

  The organization allocates audit record storage capacity in accordance with
  [Assignment: organization-defined audit record storage requirements].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations consider the types of auditing to be performed and the audit
  processing requirements when allocating audit storage capacity. Allocating
  sufficient audit storage capacity reduces the likelihood of such capacity
  being exceeded and resulting in the potential loss or reduction of auditing
  capability. Related controls: AU-2, AU-5, AU-6, AU-7, AU-11, SI-4.

  Related Controls: AR-4, AU-5(1), AU-9, AU-9(2), AU-11.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit storage capacity; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; audit record
  storage requirements; audit record storage capability for information system
  components; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Audit record storage capacity and related configuration
  settings].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] Privacy (Confidentiality Impact Level: Moderate) Overlay:
  Adequate storage capacity for logs used to audit privacy-related controls
  reduces the likelihood of the logs exceeding available storage space and
  potentially losing log information or reducing auditing capability. Audit
  information could be necessary to enforce criminal or civil penalties under
  the Privacy Act, and providing adequate storage capacity allows for preserving
  complete audit information for these purposes.

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the required
  audit record storage capacity. DoD has determined the audit record storage
  requirements are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented audit record storage requirements to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed has defined those requirements. DoD has determined the
  audit record storage requirements are not appropriate to define at the
  Enterprise level.
