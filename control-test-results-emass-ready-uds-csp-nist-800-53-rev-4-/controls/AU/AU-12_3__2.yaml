  Description:

  The information system provides the capability for [Assignment:
  organization-defined individuals or roles] to change the auditing to be
  performed on [Assignment: organization-defined information system components]
  based on [Assignment: organization-defined selectable event criteria] within
  [Assignment: organization-defined time thresholds].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement enables organizations to extend or limit auditing as
  necessary to meet organizational requirements. Auditing that is limited to
  conserve information system resources may be extended to address certain
  threat situations. In addition, auditing may be limited to a specific set of
  events to facilitate audit reduction, analysis, and reporting. Organizations
  can establish time thresholds in which audit actions are changed, for example,
  near real-time, within minutes, or within hours. Related control: AU-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit record generation; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; system-generated
  list of individuals or roles authorized to change auditing to be performed;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit record generation
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing audit record generation
  capability].

  001912: The organization defines the time thresholds for
  organizational-defined individuals or roles to change the auditing to be
  performed based on organization-defined selectable event criteria.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the time
  thresholds for individuals or roles to change the auditing to be performed on
  information system components based on selectable event criteria defined in
  AU-12 (3), CCI 1911 occurs. DoD has determined the time thresholds are not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy, referencing section
  defining the time threshold for organizational-defined individuals or roles to
  change the auditing

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented time thresholds to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  defines the time thresholds for individuals or roles to change the auditing to
  be performed on information system components based on selectable event
  criteria defined in AU-12 (3), CCI 1911 occurs. DoD has determined the time
  thresholds are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS supports dynamic changes to
  auditing configurations through its integrated logging solutions (Vector,
  Loki, and Grafana), enabling authorized personnel to adjust audit settings
  rapidly in response to selectable event criteria (e.g., security incidents,
  unusual system activity, or compliance requirements). These tools allow for
  real-time or near-real-time modification of audit configurations by designated
  administrative roles defined through centralized identity management
  (Keycloak) and Kubernetes RBAC policies. However, explicitly defining and
  formally documenting specific time thresholds for authorized personnel to
  implement changes to auditing based on selectable event criteria is an
  organizational responsibility.)
