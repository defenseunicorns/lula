control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system provides an audit reduction and report generation
  capability that

  a. Supports on-demand audit review, analysis, and reporting requirements and
  after-the-fact investigations of security incidents; and

  b. Does not alter the original content or time ordering of audit records.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit information and
  organizes such information in a summary format that is more meaningful to
  analysts. Audit reduction and report generation capabilities do not always
  emanate from the same information system or from the same organizational
  entities conducting auditing activities. Audit reduction capability can
  include, for example, modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters
  to identify anomalous behavior in audit records. The report generation
  capability provided by the information system can generate customizable
  reports. Time ordering of audit records can be a significant issue if the
  granularity of the timestamp in the record is insufficient. Related control:
  AU-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit reduction and report generation; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; audit reduction, review, analysis, and reporting tools;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit reduction and
  report generation responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].

  001877: The information system provides an audit reduction capability that
  supports after-the-fact investigations of security incidents.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed must employ information systems that
  provide an audit reduction capability that support after-the-fact
  investigations of security incidents (either natively or through the use of
  third-party tools). For information system components that have applicable
  STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the
  STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 1877.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) After action reports which include audit logs
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed employs
  information systems that provide an audit reduction capability that supports
  after-the-fact investigations of security incidents (either natively or
  through the use of third-party tools). For information system components that
  have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 1877.

  The UDS platform ensures robust audit reduction capabilities to support
  after-the-fact security investigations through its Vector, Loki, Prometheus,
  and Grafana logging and monitoring stack. Vector efficiently processes and
  normalizes log data before forwarding it to Loki, which indexes and stores
  logs for historical analysis. Security teams can query these logs in Grafana,
  leveraging filtering and visualization tools to reconstruct security events.
