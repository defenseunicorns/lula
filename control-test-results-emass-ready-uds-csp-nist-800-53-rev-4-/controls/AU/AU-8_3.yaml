  Description:

  The information system:

  a. Uses internal system clocks to generate time stamps for audit records; and

  b. Records time stamps for audit records that can be mapped to Coordinated
  Universal Time (UTC) or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and meets [Assignment:
  organization-defined granularity of time measurement].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Time stamps generated by the information system include date and time. Time is
  commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation
  of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC.
  Granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization
  between information system clocks and reference clocks, for example, clocks
  synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or within tens of milliseconds.
  Organizations may define different time granularities for different system
  components. Time service can also be critical to other security capabilities
  such as access control and identification and authentication, depending on the
  nature of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities. Related controls:
  AU-3, AU-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  time stamp generation; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing time stamp generation].

  001889: The information system records time stamps for audit records that
  meets organization-defined granularity of time measurement.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  generate time in the time stamps for audit records that meets one second
  granularity of time measurement. DoD has defined the granularity of time
  measurement as one second. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 1889.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured
  the information system to generate time in the time stamps for audit records
  that meets one second granularity of time measurement. DoD has defined the
  granularity of time measurement as one second. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 1889.
