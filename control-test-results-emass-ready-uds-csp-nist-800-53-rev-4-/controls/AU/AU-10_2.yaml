  Description:

  The information system protects against an individual (or process acting on
  behalf of an individual) falsely denying having performed [Assignment:
  organization-defined actions to be covered by non-repudiation].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Types of individual actions covered by non-repudiation include, for example,
  creating information, sending and receiving messages, approving information
  (e.g., indicating concurrence or signing a contract). Non-repudiation protects
  individuals against later claims by: (i) authors of not having authored
  particular documents; (ii) senders of not having transmitted messages; (iii)
  receivers of not having received messages; or (iv) signatories of not having
  signed documents. Non-repudiation services can be used to determine if
  information originated from a particular individual, or if an individual took
  specific actions (e.g., sending an email, signing a contract, approving a
  procurement request) or received specific information. Organizations obtain
  non-repudiation services by employing various techniques or mechanisms (e.g.,
  digital signatures, digital message receipts). Related controls: SC-12, SC-8,
  SC-13, SC-16, SC-17, SC-23.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  non-repudiation; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; information system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing non-repudiation
  capability].
