  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Reviews and analyzes information system audit records [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] for indications of [Assignment:
  organization-defined inappropriate or unusual activity]; and

  b. Reports findings to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit review, analysis, and reporting covers information security-related
  auditing performed by organizations including, for example, auditing that
  results from monitoring of account usage, remote access, wireless
  connectivity, mobile device connection, configuration settings, system
  component inventory, use of maintenance tools and nonlocal maintenance,
  physical access, temperature and humidity, equipment delivery and removal,
  communications at the information system boundaries, use of mobile code, and
  use of VoIP. Findings can be reported to organizational entities that include,
  for example, incident response team, help desk, information security
  group/department. If organizations are prohibited from reviewing and analyzing
  audit information or unable to conduct such activities (e.g., in certain
  national security applications or systems), the review/analysis may be carried
  out by other organizations granted such authority. Related controls: AC-2,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit review, analysis, and reporting; reports of audit findings; records of
  actions taken in response to reviews/analyses of audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit review, analysis,
  and reporting responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].

  001862: The organization defines the types of inappropriate or unusual
  activity to be reviewed and analyzed in the audit records.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the types of
  inappropriate or unusual activity to be reviewed and analyzed in the audit
  records. DoD has determined that the types of inappropriate or unusual
  activity are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation that defines the types of inappropriate or unusual activity
  to be reviewed
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented types of inappropriate or unusual activity to ensure they have been
  defined. DoD has determined that the types of inappropriate or unusual
  activity are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

test-results: "Prometheus can be used to define the types of alerts or dashboards for certain audit events (via metrics exported from logs, if configured). The stack enables regular review by making logs accessible and searchable. Additionally, because it√¢\x80\x99s a live monitoring stack, near-real-time analysis is possible (you can set up dashboards that update as events come in). Generating reports from these logs (e.g., weekly summaries of admin actions) can be done using Grafana or external tools exporting from Loki."
