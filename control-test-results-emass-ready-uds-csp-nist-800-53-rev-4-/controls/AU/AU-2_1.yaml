  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Determines that the information system is capable of auditing the following
  events: [Assignment: organization-defined auditable events];

  b. Coordinates the security audit function with other organizational entities
  requiring audit-related information to enhance mutual support and to help
  guide the selection of auditable events;

  c. Provides a rationale for why the auditable events are deemed to be adequate
  to support after-the-fact investigations of security incidents; and

  d. Determines that the following events are to be audited within the
  information system: [Assignment: organization-defined audited events (the
  subset of the auditable events defined in AU-2 a.) along with the frequency of
  (or situation requiring) auditing for each identified event].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  An event is any observable occurrence in an organizational information system.
  Organizations identify audit events as those events which are significant and
  relevant to the security of information systems and the environments in which
  those systems operate in order to meet specific and ongoing audit needs. Audit
  events can include, for example, password changes, failed logons, or failed
  accesses related to information systems, administrative privilege usage, PIV
  credential usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining the set of
  auditable events, organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of
  the security controls to be implemented. To balance auditing requirements with
  other information system needs, this control also requires identifying that
  subset of auditable events that are audited at a given point in time. For
  example, organizations may determine that information systems must have the
  capability to log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not
  activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the
  potential burden on system performance. Auditing requirements, including the
  need for auditable events, may be referenced in other security controls and
  control enhancements. Organizations also include auditable events that are
  required by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
  regulations, and standards. Audit records can be generated at various levels
  of abstraction, including at the packet level as information traverses the
  network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical aspect
  of an audit capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to
  problems. Organizations consider in the definition of auditable events, the
  auditing necessary to cover related events such as the steps in distributed,
  transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are distributed across
  multiple organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented
  architectures. Related controls: AC-6, AC-17, AU-3, AU-12, MA-4, MP-2, MP-4,
  SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  auditable events; security plan; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; information system auditable events; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing information system
  auditing].

  000123: The organization determines the information system must be capable of
  auditing an organization-defined list of auditable events.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed determines whether the information
  system is capable of auditing:

  - Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete
  privileges, security objects, security levels, or categories of information
  (e.g. Classification levels),

  - Successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, - Privileged activities or other
  system level access, - Starting and ending time for user access to the system,
  - Concurrent logons from different workstations, - Successful and unsuccessful
  accesses to objects, - All program initiations, - All direct access to the
  information system,

  - All account creations, modifications, disabling, and terminations,

  - All kernel module load, unload, and restart. The organization must document
  those auditable events that are not captured.

  DoD has defined the information system auditable events as successful and
  unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security
  objects, security levels, or categories of information (e.g. classification
  levels). Successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, Privileged activities or
  other system level access, Starting and ending time for user access to the
  system, Concurrent logons from different workstations, Successful and
  unsuccessful accesses to objects, All program initiations, All direct access
  to the information system. All account creations, modifications, disabling,
  and terminations. All kernel module load, unload, and restart.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy

  2.) Defined list of auditable events

  3.) Sample of logged events

  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documentation of the auditable events to ensure the information system is
  capable of auditing the:

  - Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete
  privileges, security objects, security levels, or categories of information
  (e.g. Classification levels),

  - Successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, - Privileged activities or other
  system level access, - Starting and ending time for user access to the system,
  - Concurrent logons from different workstations, - Successful and unsuccessful

  UDS generates audit records for security-relevant events throughout the stack.
  Keycloak logs authentication events (login success, failure, logout, admin
  changes to accounts), Kubernetes can generate audit logs for API calls (when
  enabled), and applications can be configured to send logs via Vector to Loki.
  The Metrics/Prometheus stack can also capture certain event metrics (like
  number of logins, resource access counts). By deploying Loki (a centralized
  log aggregator) and configuring all components to forward logs, the system can
  record events such as user authentications, privilege use, configuration
  changes, and network access attempts. For example, any invocation of an admin
  function in Keycloak is recorded as an admin event log, and NeuVector records
  security incidents (like blocked network connections or container violations).
  These logs together constitute audit records of defined events. The
  organization will need to specify which events are considered auditable (e.g.,
  admin actions, authentication attempts, data access), but UDS provides the
  means to capture them.
