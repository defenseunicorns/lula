control-acronym: AU-9(2)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system backs up audit records [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] onto a physically different system or system
  component than the system or component being audited.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement helps to ensure that a compromise of the information
  system being audited does not also result in a compromise of the audit
  records. Related controls: AU-4, AU-5, AU-11.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  protection of audit information; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation, system
  or media storing backups of information system audit records; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing the backing up of audit
  records].

  DoD has defined the frequency as every seven days.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:
  Automatically Compliant

  The organization being inspected/assessed is automatically compliant with this
  CCI because they are covered at the DoD level. DoD has defined the frequency
