control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system generates audit records containing information that
  establishes what type of event occurred, when the event occurred, where the
  event occurred, the source of the event, the outcome of the event, and the
  identity of any individuals or subjects associated with the event


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this
  control, includes, for example, time stamps, source and destination addresses,
  user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications,
  filenames involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. Event
  outcomes can include indicators of event success or failure and event-specific
  results (e.g., the security state of the information system after the event
  occurred). Related controls: AU-2, AU-8, AU-12, SI-11.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  content of audit records; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; list of
  organization-defined auditable events; information system audit records;
  information system incident reports; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing information system
  auditing of auditable events].

  000133: The information system generates audit records containing information
  that establishes the source of the event.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  generate audit records containing information that establishes the source of
  the event. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG
  guidance that pertains to CCI 133.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Sample of generated audit records

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured
  the information system to generate audit records containing information that
  establishes the source of the event. The organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment reviews the audit records generated to ensure that the
  records contain information that establishes the source of the event. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 133.

test-results: "Audit log content provided by UDS components typically includes required details. Logs from Keycloak, for instance, contain timestamp, user ID, event type, outcome (success/failure) and source IP for each login attempt or admin action. Kubernetes audit logs (if enabled) include the API method invoked, the request parameters, the user/service account who made the request, timestamp, and outcome code. NeuVector√¢\x80\x99s security event logs include what was detected/blocked, which container, and when. With Loki aggregating these, each audit record can be examined to see what event occurred, when, by whom, from where, and the result, fulfilling the content requirements. If needed, logs can also show object affected (e.g., which resource was changed in Kubernetes). Therefore, UDS can produce audit records with sufficient content to meet audit requirements. The exact schema varies by component, but collectively they provide comprehensive details."
