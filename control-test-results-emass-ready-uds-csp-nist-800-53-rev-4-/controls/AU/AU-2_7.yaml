  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Determines that the information system is capable of auditing the following
  events: [Assignment: organization-defined auditable events];

  b. Coordinates the security audit function with other organizational entities
  requiring audit-related information to enhance mutual support and to help
  guide the selection of auditable events;

  c. Provides a rationale for why the auditable events are deemed to be adequate
  to support after-the-fact investigations of security incidents; and

  d. Determines that the following events are to be audited within the
  information system: [Assignment: organization-defined audited events (the
  subset of the auditable events defined in AU-2 a.) along with the frequency of
  (or situation requiring) auditing for each identified event].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  An event is any observable occurrence in an organizational information system.
  Organizations identify audit events as those events which are significant and
  relevant to the security of information systems and the environments in which
  those systems operate in order to meet specific and ongoing audit needs. Audit
  events can include, for example, password changes, failed logons, or failed
  accesses related to information systems, administrative privilege usage, PIV
  credential usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining the set of
  auditable events, organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of
  the security controls to be implemented. To balance auditing requirements with
  other information system needs, this control also requires identifying that
  subset of auditable events that are audited at a given point in time. For
  example, organizations may determine that information systems must have the
  capability to log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not
  activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the
  potential burden on system performance. Auditing requirements, including the
  need for auditable events, may be referenced in other security controls and
  control enhancements. Organizations also include auditable events that are
  required by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
  regulations, and standards. Audit records can be generated at various levels
  of abstraction, including at the packet level as information traverses the
  network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical aspect
  of an audit capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to
  problems. Organizations consider in the definition of auditable events, the
  auditing necessary to cover related events such as the steps in distributed,
  transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are distributed across
  multiple organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented
  architectures. Related controls: AC-6, AC-17, AU-3, AU-12, MA-4, MP-2, MP-4,
  SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  auditable events; security plan; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; information system auditable events; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing information system
  auditing].

  001485: The organization defines the events which are to be audited on the
  information system on an organization-defined frequency of (or situation
  requiring) auditing for each identified event.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents events which
  are to be audited on the information system. Events should be selected from
  the events the information system is capable of auditing as defined in AU-2
  (a) and should be based on ongoing risk assessments of current threat
  information and environment. DoD has determined that the events are not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy and/or procedures
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines 

  the documented list of events which are to be audited on the information
  system to ensure those events have been defined.


  DoD has determined that the events are not appropriate to define at the
  Enterprise level.
