control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system:

  (a) Compares the internal information system clocks [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] with [Assignment: organization-defined
  authoritative time source]; and

  (b) Synchronizes the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source
  when the time difference is greater than [Assignment: organization-defined
  time period].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement provides uniformity of time stamps for information
  systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  time stamp generation; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing internal information
  system clock synchronization].

  001891: The information system compares internal information system clocks on
  an organization-defined frequency with an organization-defined authoritative
  time source.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  synchronize internal information system clocks every 24 hours for networked
  systems with an authoritative time server which is synchronized with redundant
  United States Naval Observatory (USNO) time servers as designated for the
  appropriate DoD network (NIPRNet / SIPRNet) and/or the Global Positioning
  System (GPS) when the time difference is greater than the difference defined
  in AU-8 (1), CCI 1892.

  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 1891.

  DoD has defined the frequency as every 24 hours for networked systems.

  DoD has defined the authoritative time source as an authoritative time server
  which is synchronized with redundant United States Naval Observatory (USNO)
  time servers as designated for the appropriate DoD network (NIPRNet / SIPRNet)
  and/or the Global Positioning System (GPS).

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured
  the information system to synchronize internal information system clocks every
  24 hours for networked systems with an authoritative time server which is
  synchronized with redundant United States Naval Observatory (USNO) time
  servers as designated for the appropriate DoD network (NIPRNet / SIPRNet)
  and/or the Global Positioning System (GPS) when the time difference is greater
  than the difference defined in AU-8 (1), CCI 1892.

  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 1891.

  DoD has defined the frequency as every 24 hours for networked systems.

  DoD has defined the authoritative time source as an authoritative time server
  which is synchronized with redundant United States Naval Observatory (USNO)
  time servers as designated for the appropriate DoD network (NIPRNet / SIPRNet)
  and/or the Global Positioning System (GPS).

  UDS ensures precise synchronization of internal system clocks through
  Kubernetes infrastructure, which is configured to regularly synchronize with
  an authoritative time source using the Network Time Protocol (NTP). Kubernetes
  nodes, containers, and all associated UDS components maintain time
  synchronization by periodically (at intervals defined by the organization's
  policy) comparing and aligning their internal clocks with the organization's
  designated authoritative NTP servers. This synchronization ensures consistent
  and accurate timestamps across audit logs collected by Vector and stored in
  Loki, facilitating accurate event correlation and compliance auditing.
