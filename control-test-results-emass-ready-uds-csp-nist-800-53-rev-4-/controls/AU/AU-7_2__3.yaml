  Description:

  The information system provides the capability to sort and search audit
  records for events of interest based on the content of [Assignment:
  organization-defined audit fields within audit records].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Sorting and searching of audit records may be based upon the contents of audit
  record fields, for example: (i) date/time of events; (ii) user identifiers;
  (iii) Internet Protocol (IP) addresses involved in the event; (iv) type of
  event; or (v) event success/failure.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit reduction and report generation; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; audit reduction, review, analysis, and reporting tools; audit
  record criteria (fields) establishing events of interest; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit reduction and
  report generation responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Audit reduction and report generation capability].

  001886: The information system provides the capability to sort audit records
  for events of interest based on the content of organization-defined audit
  fields within audit records.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed must employ information systems that
  provide the capability to sort audit records for events of interest based on
  the content of audit fields within audit records as defined in AU-7 (2), CCI
  1884. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs,
  the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG
  guidance that pertains to CCI 1886.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy

  2.) Example of audit log report based on events of interest
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed employs
  information systems that provide the capability to sort audit records for
  events of interest based on the content of audit fields within audit records
  as defined in AU-7 (2), CCI 1884. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 1886.

  UDS provides robust audit record sorting capabilities through its integrated
  logging and analytics solutions, specifically Vector, Loki, and Grafana. These
  tools capture and store audit records in structured, indexed formats, enabling
  administrators to sort events based explicitly on the content of
  organizationally defined audit fields such as timestamps, user identities,
  source and destination IP addresses, actions, event types, and authentication
  outcomes. Administrators can configure Grafana dashboards and queries to
  rapidly sort, visualize, and analyze audit records, facilitating efficient
  detection and investigation of security events. Thus, UDS fully meets the
  requirement to sort audit records based on defined audit fields, aligning
  closely with organizational security monitoring objectives.
