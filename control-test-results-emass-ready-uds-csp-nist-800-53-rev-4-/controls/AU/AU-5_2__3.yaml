  Description:

  The information system provides an alert in [Assignment: organization-defined
  real-time period] to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel, roles,
  and/or locations] when the following audit failure events occur: [Assignment:
  organization-defined audit failure events requiring real-time alerts].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Alerts provide organizations with urgent messages. Real-time alerts provide
  these messages at information technology speed (i.e., the time from event
  detection to alert occurs in seconds or less).


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  response to audit processing failures; information system design
  documentation; security plan; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; records of notifications or real-time alerts when
  audit processing failures occur; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing real-time audit alerts
  when organization-defined audit failure events occur].

  001857: The organization defines the personnel, roles and/or locations to
  receive alerts when organization-defined audit failure events occur.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents any personnel
  or roles, in addition to the SCA and ISSO, who shall receive alerts when all
  audit failure events occur. If there are no additional personnel or roles, the
  organization must also document that. DoD has defined the personnel or roles
  as at a minimum, the SCA and ISSO. DoD has defined the audit failure events as
  all.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy

  2.) List of personnel who receive indications of organization-defined
  inappropriate or unusual activity
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented list of personnel or roles who should receive alerts when all audit
  failure events occur to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed has
  either defined additional personnel or roles, or identified that there are no
  additional personnel or roles. DoD has defined the audit failure events as
  all.

  Within Grafana all defined personnel and roles that receive alerts can be
  found in the Contact Points tab. The Grafana Contact Points API can also
  return a JSON file with the list of recipients as evidence, "GET
  /api/v1/provisioning/contact-points".
