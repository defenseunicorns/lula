  Description:

  The information system:

  a. Provides audit record generation capability for the auditable events
  defined in AU-2 a. at [Assignment: organization-defined information system
  components];

  b. Allows [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to select
  which auditable events are to be audited by specific components of the
  information system; and

  c. Generates audit records for the events defined in AU-2

  d. with the content defined in AU-3.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit records can be generated from many different information system
  components. The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits
  are to be generated. These events are typically a subset of all events for
  which the information system is capable of generating audit records. Related
  controls: AC-3, AU-2, AU-3, AU-6, AU-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit record generation; security plan; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; list of auditable events; information system audit records;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit record generation
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing audit record generation
  capability].

  000171: The information system allows organization-defined personnel or roles
  to select which auditable events are to be audited by specific components of
  the information system.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  ensure that only the ISSM or individuals appointed by the ISSM select which
  auditable events are to be audited by specific components of the information
  system. DoD has defined the personnel or roles as the ISSM or individuals
  appointed by the ISSM.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically Compliant
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines a sampling of
  information system components and confirms that the individuals capable of
  selecting auditable events are the ISSM or individuals appointed by the ISSM.
  DoD has defined the personnel or roles as the ISSM or individuals appointed by
  the ISSM.

test-results: "All UDS components are configured to generate the necessary audit records. The system by default logs security-relevant events without requiring custom development. For instance, Keycloak generates login/logout events, NeuVector generates security incident logs, and Kubernetes (with auditing enabled) can log API calls. UDSÃ¢\x80\x99s integration of these tools ensures audit records are generated automatically during normal operation. The presence of multiple auditing sources (identity, network, container security) means UDS comprehensively covers audit generation for various event types."
