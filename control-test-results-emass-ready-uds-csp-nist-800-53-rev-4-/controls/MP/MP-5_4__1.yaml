family: MP
control-acronym: MP-5(4)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect the
  confidentiality and integrity of information stored on digital media during
  transport outside of controlled areas.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement applies to both portable storage devices (e.g., USB
  memory sticks, compact disks, digital video disks, external/removable hard
  disk drives) and mobile devices with storage capability (e.g., smart phones,
  tablets, E-readers). Related control: MP-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system media protection policy; procedures
  addressing media transport; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system media transport records; audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  media transport responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Cryptographic mechanisms protecting information on digital
  media during transportation outside controlled areas].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP
  Moderate Baseline, Rev 4

cci-definition: >-
  001027: The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect
  the confidentiality and integrity of information stored on digital media
  during transport outside of controlled areas.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed shall document within their Security
  Plan, and implement, FIPS 140-2 or other NSA approved cryptographic mechanisms
  to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information stored on digital
  media during transport outside of controlled areas.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation or System Security Plan (SSP) that shows the organization
  has implemented cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and
  integrity of information stored on digital media during transport outside of
  controlled areas.

  2.) Training documentation for personnel on the guidelines of transporting
  information system media.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  Security Plan to ensure the organization being inspected has identified FIPS
  140-2 or other NSA approved cryptographic mechanisms to protect the
  confidentiality and integrity of information stored on digital media during
  transport outside of controlled areas.
