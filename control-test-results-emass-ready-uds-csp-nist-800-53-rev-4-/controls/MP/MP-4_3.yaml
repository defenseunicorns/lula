  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Physically controls and securely stores [Assignment: organization-defined
  types of digital and/or non-digital media] within [Assignment:
  organization-defined controlled areas]; and

  b. Protects information system media until the media are destroyed or
  sanitized using approved equipment, techniques, and procedures.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital
  media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable
  hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks.
  Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. Physically
  controlling information system media includes, for example, conducting
  inventories, ensuring procedures are in place to allow individuals to check
  out and return media to the media library, and maintaining accountability for
  all stored media. Secure storage includes, for example, a locked drawer, desk,
  or cabinet, or a controlled media library. The type of media storage is
  commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the
  information residing on the media. Controlled areas are areas for which
  organizations provide sufficient physical and procedural safeguards to meet
  the requirements established for protecting information and/or information
  systems. For media containing information determined by organizations to be in
  the public domain, to be publicly releasable, or to have limited or no adverse
  impact on organizations or individuals if accessed by other than authorized
  personnel, fewer safeguards may be needed. In these situations, physical
  access controls provide adequate protection. Related controls: CP-6, CP-9,
  MP-2, MP-7, PE-3.


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: MP-4 (a)
  Requirement: The service provider defines controlled areas within facilities
  where the information and information system reside.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system media protection policy; procedures
  addressing media storage; physical and environmental protection policy and
  procedures; access control policy and procedures; security plan; information
  system media; designated controlled areas; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  media protection and storage responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for storing information media;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing secure media storage/media
  protection].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.

cci-definition: >-
  001016: The organization defines controlled areas where organization-defined
  types of digital and/or non-digital media are physically controlled and
  securely stored.
implementation-guidance: >-
  DoD has defined the controlled areas as areas approved for processing or
  storing data IAW the sensitivity and/or classification level of the
  information contained on/within the media.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically compliant
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed is automatically compliant with this
  CCI because they are covered at the DoD level. DoD has defined the controlled
  areas as areas approved for processing or storing data IAW the sensitivity
  and/or classification level of the information contained on/within the media.
