  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Sanitizes [Assignment: organization-defined information system media] prior
  to disposal, release out of organizational control, or release for reuse using
  [Assignment: organization-defined sanitization techniques and procedures] in
  accordance with applicable federal and organizational standards and policies;
  and

  b. Employs sanitization mechanisms with the strength and integrity
  commensurate with the security category or classification of the information.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies to all information system media, both digital and
  non-digital, subject to disposal or reuse, whether or not the media is
  considered removable. Examples include media found in scanners, copiers,
  printers, notebook computers, workstations, network components, and mobile
  devices. The sanitization process removes information from the media such that
  the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques,
  including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, and destruction, prevent the
  disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals when such media is
  reused or released for disposal. Organizations determine the appropriate
  sanitization methods recognizing that destruction is sometimes necessary when
  other methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization. Organizations
  use discretion on the employment of approved sanitization techniques and
  procedures for media containing information deemed to be in the public domain
  or publicly releasable, or deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations
  or individuals if released for reuse or disposal. Sanitization of non-digital
  media includes, for example, removing a classified appendix from an otherwise
  unclassified document, or redacting selected sections or words from a document
  by obscuring the redacted sections/words in a manner equivalent in
  effectiveness to removing them from the document. NSA standards and policies
  control the sanitization process for media containing classified information.
  Related controls: MA-2, MA-4, RA-3, SC-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system media protection policy; procedures
  addressing media sanitization and disposal; applicable federal standards and
  policies addressing media sanitization; media sanitization records; audit
  records; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with media sanitization
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for media sanitization; automated
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing media sanitization].


  Justification to Select:

  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.

cci-definition: >-
  001028: The organization sanitizes organization-defined information system
  media prior to disposal, release out of organizational control, or release for
  reuse using organization-defined sanitization techniques and procedures in
  accordance with applicable federal and organizational standards and policies.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed sanitizes all media prior to
  disposal, release out of organizational control, or release for reuse IAW DoDM
  5200.01 Vol. 1-4 using techniques and procedures IAW NIST SP 800-88. DoD has
  defined the sanitization techniques as techniques and procedures IAW NIST SP
  800-88. DoD has defined the information system media as all media.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) TTP or SOP showing steps for media sanitation.

  2.) System Security Plan (SSP), if necessary, referencing sections which apply
  to disposal and release for reuse out of organizational control.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines
  media sanitization records, audit records, any other relevant documents or
  records, and sanitization tools to ensure sanitization is in compliance with
  DoDM 5200.01 Vol. 1-4 and uses techniques and procedures IAW NIST SP 800-88.
  The objective of the review is to verify the organization is sanitizing its
  digital and non-digital information system media prior to disposal, release
  for reuse, or release out of the organizational control. DoD has defined the
  sanitization techniques as techniques and procedures IAW NIST SP 800-88. DoD
  has defined the information system media as all media.
