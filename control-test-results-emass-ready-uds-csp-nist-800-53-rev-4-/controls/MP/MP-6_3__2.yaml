  Description:

  The organization applies nondestructive sanitization techniques to portable
  storage devices prior to connecting such devices to the information system
  under the following circumstances: [Assignment: organization-defined
  circumstances requiring sanitization of portable storage devices].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement applies to digital media containing classified
  information and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Portable storage
  devices can be the source of malicious code insertions into organizational
  information systems. Many of these devices are obtained from unknown and
  potentially untrustworthy sources and may contain malicious code that can be
  readily transferred to information systems through USB ports or other entry
  portals. While scanning such storage devices is always recommended,
  sanitization provides additional assurance that the devices are free of
  malicious code to include code capable of initiating zero-day attacks.
  Organizations consider nondestructive sanitization of portable storage devices
  when such devices are first purchased from the manufacturer or vendor prior to
  initial use or when organizations lose a positive chain of custody for the
  devices. Related control: SI-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system media protection policy; procedures
  addressing media sanitization and disposal; list of circumstances requiring
  sanitization of portable storage devices; media sanitization records; audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  media sanitization responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for media sanitization of
  portable storage devices; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  media sanitization].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, but NOT included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4

cci: 1033
cci-definition: >-
  001033: The organization defines circumstances requiring sanitization of
  portable storage devices prior to connecting such devices to the information
  system.
implementation-guidance: >-
  DoD has defined the list circumstances as when such devices are first
  purchased from the manufacturer or vendor prior to initial use, when being
  considered for reuse, or when the organization loses a positive chain of
  custody for the device. Media obtained from unknown sources shall not be
  sanitized and reused.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically compliant
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed is automatically compliant with this
  CCI because they are covered at the DoD level. DoD has defined the
  circumstances as when such devices are first purchased from the manufacturer
  or vendor prior to initial use, when being considered for reuse, or when the
  organization loses a positive chain of custody for the device. Media obtained
  from unknown sources shall not be sanitized and reused.
