  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Scans for vulnerabilities in the information system and hosted applications
  [Assignment: organization-defined frequency and/or randomly in accordance with
  organization-defined process] and when new vulnerabilities potentially
  affecting the system/applications are identified and reported;

  b. Employs vulnerability scanning tools and techniques that facilitate
  interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability
  management process by using standards for:

  1. Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;

  2. Formatting checklists and test procedures; and

  3. Measuring vulnerability impact;

  c. Analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control
  assessments;

  d. Remediates legitimate vulnerabilities [Assignment: organization-defined
  response times] in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk; and

  e. Shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and
  security control assessments with [Assignment: organization-defined personnel
  or roles] to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other information
  systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or deficiencies).


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Security categorization of information systems guides the frequency and
  comprehensiveness of vulnerability scans. Organizations determine the required
  vulnerability scanning for all information system components, ensuring that
  potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and
  copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software
  applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis,
  dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches.
  Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools
  (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary
  analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for
  example: (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports,
  protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and
  (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information
  flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express
  vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming
  convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to
  determine/test for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for
  vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)
  listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In addition, security
  control assessments such as red team exercises provide other sources of
  potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using
  tools that express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring
  System (CVSS). Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, CM-4, CM-6, RA-2, RA-3, SA-11,
  SI-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
