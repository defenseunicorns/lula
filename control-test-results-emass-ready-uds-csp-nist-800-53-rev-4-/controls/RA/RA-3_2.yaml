family: RA
control-acronym: RA-3
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Conducts an assessment of risk, including the likelihood and magnitude of
  harm, from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification,
  or destruction of the information system and the information it processes,
  stores, or transmits;

  b. Documents risk assessment results in [Selection: security plan; risk
  assessment report; [Assignment: organization-defined document]];

  c. Reviews risk assessment results [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency];

  d. Disseminates risk assessment results to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles]; and

  e. Updates the risk assessment [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] or
  whenever there are significant changes to the information system or
  environment of operation (including the identification of new threats and
  vulnerabilities), or other conditions that may impact the security state of
  the system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Clearly defined authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective risk
  assessments. Risk assessments take into account threats, vulnerabilities,
  likelihood, and impact to organizational operations and assets, individuals,
  other organizations, and the Nation based on the operation and use of
  information systems. Risk assessments also take into account risk from
  external parties (e.g., service providers, contractors operating information
  systems on behalf of the organization, individuals accessing organizational
  information systems, outsourcing entities). In accordance with OMB policy and
  related E-authentication initiatives, authentication of public users accessing
  federal information systems may also be required to protect nonpublic or
  privacy-related information. As such, organizational assessments of risk also
  address public access to federal information systems.
   Risk assessments (either formal or informal) can be conducted at all three tiers in the risk management hierarchy (i.e., organization level, mission/business process level, or information system level) and at any phase in the system development life cycle. Risk assessments can also be conducted at various steps in the Risk Management Framework, including categorization, security control selection, security control implementation, security control assessment, information system authorization, and security control monitoring. RA-3 is noteworthy in that the control must be partially implemented prior to the implementation of other controls in order to complete the first two steps in the Risk Management Framework. Risk assessments can play an important role in security control selection processes, particularly during the application of tailoring guidance, which includes security control supplementation. Related controls: RA-2, PM-9.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
