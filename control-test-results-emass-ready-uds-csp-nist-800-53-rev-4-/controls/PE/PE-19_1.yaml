  Description:

  The organization protects the information system from information leakage due
  to electromagnetic signals emanations.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information leakage is the intentional or unintentional release of information
  to an untrusted environment from electromagnetic signals emanations. Security
  categories or classifications of information systems (with respect to
  confidentiality) and organizational security policies guide the selection of
  security controls employed to protect systems against information leakage due
  to electromagnetic signals emanations.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing information leakage due to electromagnetic signals
  emanations; mechanisms protecting the information system against electronic
  signals emanation; facility housing the information system; records from
  electromagnetic signals emanation tests; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  information system environmental controls; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  protection from information leakage due to electromagnetic signals
  emanations].

  leakage due to electromagnetic signals emanations.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will obtain a TEMPEST countermeasure
  review and implement the required countermeasures in order to protect the
  information system from information leakage due to electromagnetic signals
  emanations.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documented TEMPEST countermeasure review results
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  TEMPEST countermeasures review and inspects the information system to ensure
  those countermeasures have been implemented.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Physical access controls, monitoring,
  device protection, etc., must be managed in the data center, cloud facility,
  or on-premise environment and are not functions of UDS. UDS assumes the
  physical environment is secured per organizational policy.)
