control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Maintains temperature and humidity levels within the facility where the
  information system resides at [Assignment: organization - defined acceptable
  levels]; and

  b. Monitors temperature and humidity levels [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies primarily to facilities containing concentrations of
  information system resources, for example, data centers, server rooms, and
  mainframe computer rooms. Related control: AT-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing temperature and humidity control; security plan;
  temperature and humidity controls; facility housing the information system;
  temperature and humidity controls documentation; temperature and humidity
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  information system environmental controls; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  maintenance and monitoring of temperature and humidity levels].

  000971: The organization maintains temperature and humidity levels within the
  facility where the information system resides at organization-defined
  acceptable levels.
implementation-guidance: "Humidity controls are not required for general office areas where information system components may be in use and are only required where there are concentrations of information systems such as server farms, mainframes, etc. The organization being inspected/assessed must maintain temperature and where applicable humidity levels of for commercial grade information systems: 64.4 â\x80\x93 80.6 degrees F; 45% â\x80\x93 60% Relative Humidity; Dew Point 41.9 Â° â\x80\x93 59Â°F; measured at the air intake inlet of the IT equipment casing; for other systems, levels within manufacturer specifications. DoD has defined the acceptable levels as for commercial grade information systems: 64.4 â\x80\x93 80.6 degrees F; 45% â\x80\x93 60% Relative Humidity; Dew Point 41.9 Â° â\x80\x93 59Â°F; measured at the air intake inlet of the IT equipment casing; for other systems, levels within manufacturer specifications.\nRecommended Compelling Evidence:\n1.) Audit logs for temperature and humidity"
assessment-procedures: "The organization conducting the inspection/assessment reviews temperature and humidity controls to validate that they are set within DoD specified guidelines. DoD has defined the acceptable levels as for commercial grade information systems: 64.4 â\x80\x93 80.6 degrees F; 45% â\x80\x93 60% Relative Humidity; Dew Point 41.9 Â° â\x80\x93 59Â°F; measured at the air intake inlet of the IT equipment casing; for other systems, levels within manufacturer specifications."
