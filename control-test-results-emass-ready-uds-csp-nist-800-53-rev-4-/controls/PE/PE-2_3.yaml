family: PE
control-acronym: PE-2
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Develops, approves, and maintains a list of individuals with authorized
  access to the facility where the information system resides;

  b. Issues authorization credentials for facility access;

  c. Reviews the access list detailing authorized facility access by individuals
  [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and

  d. Removes individuals from the facility access list when access is no longer
  required.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies to organizational employees and visitors. Individuals
  (e.g., employees, contractors, and others) with permanent physical access
  authorization credentials are not considered visitors. Authorization
  credentials include, for example, badges, identification cards, and smart
  cards. Organizations determine the strength of authorization credentials
  needed (including level of forge-proof badges, smart cards, or identification
  cards) consistent with federal standards, policies, and procedures. This
  control only applies to areas within facilities that have not been designated
  as publicly accessible. Related controls: PE-3, PE-4, PS-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing physical access authorizations; security plan;
  authorized personnel access list; authorization credentials; physical access
  list reviews; physical access termination records and associated
  documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with physical access
  authorization responsibilities; organizational personnel with physical access
  to information system facility; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for physical access
  authorizations; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing physical
  access authorizations].
