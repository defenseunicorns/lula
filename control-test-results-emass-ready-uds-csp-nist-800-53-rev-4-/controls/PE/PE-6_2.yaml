control-acronym: PE-6
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Monitors physical access to the facility where the information system
  resides to detect and respond to physical security incidents;

  b. Reviews physical access logs [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]
  and upon occurrence of [Assignment: organization-defined events or potential
  indications of events]; and

  c. Coordinates results of reviews and investigations with the organizational
  incident response capability.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizational incident response capabilities include investigations of and
  responses to detected physical security incidents. Security incidents include,
  for example, apparent security violations or suspicious physical access
  activities. Suspicious physical access activities include, for example: (i)
  accesses outside of normal work hours; (ii) repeated accesses to areas not
  normally accessed; (iii) accesses for unusual lengths of time; and (iv)
  out-of-sequence accesses. Related controls: CA-7, IR-4, IR-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing physical access monitoring; security plan; physical
  access logs or records; physical access monitoring records; physical access
  log reviews; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with physical access
  monitoring responsibilities; organizational personnel with incident response
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for monitoring physical access;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing physical access
  monitoring; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing reviewing of
  physical access logs].

  002940: The organization reviews physical access logs upon occurrence of
  organization-defined events or potential indications of events
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to review physical access logs upon occurrence of events or potential
  indications of events defined in PE-6, CCI 2941. The organization must
  maintain records of reviews.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Facility access control policy and procedures, including a section on
  monitoring and response to physical access security incidents

  2.) AAR for any physical access security incidents (to include records
  reviewed during the incident).
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented process as well as the records of reviews to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed reviews physical access logs upon
  occurrence of events or potential indications of events defined in PE-6, CCI
  2941.
