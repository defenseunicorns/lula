family: PE
control-acronym: PE-16
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization authorizes, monitors, and controls [Assignment:
  organization-defined types of information system components] entering and
  exiting the facility and maintains records of those items.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Effectively enforcing authorizations for entry and exit of information system
  components may require restricting access to delivery areas and possibly
  isolating the areas from the information system and media libraries. Related
  controls: CM-3, MA-2, MA-3, MP-5, SA-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing delivery and removal of information system components
  from the facility; security plan; facility housing the information system;
  records of items entering and exiting the facility; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  controlling information system components entering and exiting the facility;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational process for authorizing, monitoring, and
  controlling information system-related items entering and exiting the
  facility; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing authorizing,
  monitoring, and controlling information system-related items entering and
  exiting the facility].

  000983: The organization controls organization-defined types of information
  system components entering and exiting the facility.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed:

  1. Documents in their physical and environmental protection plan (PE-1)
  controls for all system components entering and exiting the facility.

  2. Implements documented controls for system components entering and exiting
  the facility. DoD has defined the types of information system components as
  all system components.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Facility access list
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  physical and environmental protection plan to determine if controls have been
  documented for all system components entering and exiting the facility and
  visually inspects the controls (e.g., logs, scans, etc.) to ensure
  implementation. DoD has defined the types of information system components as
  all system components.
