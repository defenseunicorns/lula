control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization performs security checks [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency] at the physical boundary of the facility or information system for
  unauthorized exfiltration of information or removal of information system
  components.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations determine the extent, frequency, and/or randomness of security
  checks to adequately mitigate risk associated with exfiltration. Related
  controls: AC-4, SC-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing physical access control; physical access control logs or
  records; records of security checks; security audit reports; security
  inspection reports; facility layout documentation; information system entry
  and exit points; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with physical access control
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for physical access control to
  the facility and/or information system; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing physical access control for the facility or information system;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing security checks for
  unauthorized exfiltration of information].

  002927: The organization defines the frequency to perform security checks at
  the physical boundary of the facility or information system for unauthorized
  exfiltration of information or removal of information system components.
implementation-guidance: |-
  DoD has defined the frequency as at a minimum, annually.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:
  Automatically Compliant
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed is automatically compliant with this
  CCI because they are covered at the DoD level. DoD has defined the frequency
  as at a minimum, annually.
