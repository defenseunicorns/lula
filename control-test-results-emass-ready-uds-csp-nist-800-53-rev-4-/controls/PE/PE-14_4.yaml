family: PE
control-acronym: PE-14
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Maintains temperature and humidity levels within the facility where the
  information system resides at [Assignment: organization - defined acceptable
  levels]; and

  b. Monitors temperature and humidity levels [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies primarily to facilities containing concentrations of
  information system resources, for example, data centers, server rooms, and
  mainframe computer rooms. Related control: AT-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing temperature and humidity control; security plan;
  temperature and humidity controls; facility housing the information system;
  temperature and humidity controls documentation; temperature and humidity
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  information system environmental controls; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  maintenance and monitoring of temperature and humidity levels].

  000974: The organization defines a frequency for monitoring temperature and
  humidity levels.
implementation-guidance: >-
  DoD has defined the frequency as continuously unless manufacturer
  specifications allow for a wide enough tolerance that control is not required.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically Compliant
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed is automatically compliant with this
  CCI because they are covered at the DoD level. DoD has defined the frequency
  as continuously unless manufacturer specifications allow for a wide enough
  tolerance that control is not required.
