control-acronym: PE-10
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Provides the capability of shutting off power to the information system or
  individual system components in emergency situations;

  b. Places emergency shutoff switches or devices in [Assignment:
  organization-defined location by information system or system component] to
  facilitate safe and easy access for personnel; and

  c. Protects emergency power shutoff capability from unauthorized activation.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies primarily to facilities containing concentrations of
  information system resources including, for example, data centers, server
  rooms, and mainframe computer rooms. Related control: PE-15.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing power source emergency shutoff; security plan; emergency
  shutoff controls or switches; locations housing emergency shutoff switches and
  devices; security safeguards protecting emergency power shutoff capability
  from unauthorized activation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  emergency power shutoff capability (both implementing and using the
  capability); organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  emergency power shutoff].

  000958: The organization defines a location for emergency shutoff switches or
  devices by information system or system component.
implementation-guidance: >-
  DoD has defined the location as near more than one egress point of the IT area
  and ensures it is labeled and protected by a cover to prevent accidental
  shut-off.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically Compliant
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed is automatically compliant with this
  CCI because they are covered at the DoD level. DoD has defined the location as
  near more than one egress point of the IT area and ensures it is labeled and
  protected by a cover to prevent accidental shut-off.
