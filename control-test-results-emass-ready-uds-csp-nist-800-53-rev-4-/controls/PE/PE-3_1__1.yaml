family: PE
control-acronym: PE-3(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization enforces physical access authorizations to the information
  system in addition to the physical access controls for the facility at
  [Assignment: organization-defined physical spaces containing one or more
  components of the information system].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement provides additional physical security for those areas
  within facilities where there is a concentration of information system
  components (e.g., server rooms, media storage areas, data and communications
  centers). Related control: PS-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing physical access control; physical access control logs or
  records; physical access control devices; access authorizations; access
  credentials; information system entry and exit points; list of areas within
  the facility containing concentrations of information system components or
  information system components requiring additional physical protection; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with physical access
  authorization responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for physical access control to
  the information system/components; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing physical access control for facility areas containing information
  system components].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.

  000928: The organization enforces physical access authorizations to the
  information system in addition to the physical access controls for the
  facility at organization-defined physical spaces containing one or more
  components of the information system.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will provide documentation of
  additional physical access authorizations for the facility/facilities at
  physical spaces containing one or more components of the information system
  defined in PE-3 (1), CCI 2926. The organization will ensure that these
  controls are separate from, and independent of, the physical access controls
  established for the facility.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) List of additional physical access authorizations
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented list of additional physical access authorizations for the
  facility/facilities at physical spaces containing one or more components of
  the information system. The objective of the examination is to determine if
  the organization is enforcing additional physical access authorizations to
  areas of the facility at physical spaces containing one or more components of
  the information system defined in PE-3 (1), CCI 2926. These controls are
  independent of the physical access controls established for the facility.
