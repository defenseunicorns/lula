  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Maintains visitor access records to the facility where the information
  system resides for [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and

  b. Reviews visitor access records [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Visitor access records include, for example, names and organizations of
  persons visiting, visitor signatures, forms of identification, dates of
  access, entry and departure times, purposes of visits, and names and
  organizations of persons visited. Visitor access records are not required for
  publicly accessible areas.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing visitor access records; security plan; visitor access
  control logs or records; visitor access record or log reviews; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with visitor access records
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for maintaining and reviewing
  visitor access records; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  maintenance and review of visitor access records].
