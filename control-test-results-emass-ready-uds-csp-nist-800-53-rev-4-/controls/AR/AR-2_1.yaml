  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Documents and implements a privacy risk management process that assesses
  privacy risk to individuals resulting from the collection, sharing, storing,
  transmitting, use, and disposal of personally identifiable information (PII);
  and

  b. Conducts Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) for information systems,
  programs, or other activities that pose a privacy risk in accordance with
  applicable law, OMB policy, or any existing organizational policies and
  procedures.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizational privacy risk management processes operate across the life
  cycles of all mission/business processes that collect, use, maintain, share,
  or dispose of PII. The tools and processes for managing risk are specific to
  organizational missions and resources. They include, but are not limited to,
  the conduct of PIAs. The PIA is both a process and the document that is the
  outcome of that process. OMB Memorandum 03-22 provides guidance to
  organizations for implementing the privacy provisions of the E-Government Act
  of 2002, including guidance on when PIAs are required for information systems.
  Some organizations may be required by law or policy to extend the PIA
  requirement to other activities involving PII or otherwise impacting privacy
  (e.g., programs, projects, or regulations). PIAs are conducted to identify
  privacy risks and identify methods to mitigate those risks. PIAs are also
  conducted to ensure that programs or information systems comply with legal,
  regulatory, and policy requirements. PIAs also serve as notice to the public
  of privacy practices. PIAs are performed before developing or procuring
  information systems, or initiating programs or projects, that collect, use,
  maintain, or share PII and are updated when changes create new privacy risks.
