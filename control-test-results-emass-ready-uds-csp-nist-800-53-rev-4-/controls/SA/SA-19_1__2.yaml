  Description:

  The organization trains [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]
  to detect counterfeit information system components (including hardware,
  software, and firmware).


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy;
  anti-counterfeit policy and procedures; media disposal policy; media
  protection policy; incident response policy; training materials addressing
  counterfeit information system components; training records on detection of
  counterfeit information system components; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and services
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibility for
  anti-counterfeit policy, procedures, and training].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for anti-counterfeit training].

  003368: The organization defines the personnel or roles to be trained to
  detect counterfeit information system components (including hardware,
  software, and firmware).
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the personnel
  or roles to be trained to detect counterfeit information system components
  (including hardware, software, and firmware). DoD has determined the personnel
  or roles are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP).

  2.) System development life cycle (SDLC) documentation.

  3.) Continuous monitoring plan for defining the organization-defined personnel
  or roles to detect counterfeit information system components (including
  hardware, software, and firmware).
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented personnel or roles to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed defines the personnel or roles to be trained to detect
  counterfeit information system components (including hardware, software, and
  firmware). DoD has determined the personnel or roles are not appropriate to
  define at the Enterprise level.
