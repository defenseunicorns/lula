family: SA
control-acronym: SA-10
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization requires the developer of the information system, system
  component, or information system service to:

  a. Perform configuration management during system, component, or service
  [Selection (one or more): design; development; implementation; operation];

  b. Document, manage, and control the integrity of changes to [Assignment:
  organization-defined configuration items under configuration management];

  c. Implement only organization-approved changes to the system, component, or
  service;

  d. Document approved changes to the system, component, or service and the
  potential security impacts of such changes; and

  e. Track security flaws and flaw resolution within the system, component, or
  service and report findings to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control also applies to organizations conducting internal information
  systems development and integration. Organizations consider the quality and
  completeness of the configuration management activities conducted by
  developers as evidence of applying effective security safeguards. Safeguards
  include, for example, protecting from unauthorized modification or
  destruction, the master copies of all material used to generate
  security-relevant portions of the system hardware, software, and firmware.
  Maintaining the integrity of changes to the information system, information
  system component, or information system service requires configuration control
  throughout the system development life cycle to track authorized changes and
  prevent unauthorized changes. Configuration items that are placed under
  configuration management (if existence/use is required by other security
  controls) include: the formal model; the functional, high-level, and low-level
  design specifications; other design data; implementation documentation; source
  code and hardware schematics; the running version of the object code; tools
  for comparing new versions of security-relevant hardware descriptions and
  software/firmware source code with previous versions; and test fixtures and
  documentation. Depending on the mission/business needs of organizations and
  the nature of the contractual relationships in place, developers may provide
  configuration management support during the operations and maintenance phases
  of the life cycle. Related controls: CM-3, CM-4, CM-9, SA-12, SI-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing system developer configuration management; solicitation
  documentation; acquisition documentation; service-level agreements;
  acquisition contracts for the information system, system component, or
  information system service; system developer configuration management plan;
  security flaw and flaw resolution tracking records; system change
  authorization records; change control records; configuration management
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and services
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with configuration
  management responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for monitoring developer
  configuration management; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  the monitoring of developer configuration management].

  003156: The organization requires the developer of the information system,
  system component, or information system service to document the integrity of
  changes to organization-defined configuration items under configuration
  management.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed requires within contracts/agreements
  that the developer of the information system, system component, or information
  system service document the integrity of changes to configuration items under
  configuration management defined in SA-10, CCI 3159.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP).

  2.) System development life cycle (SDLC) documentation.

  3.) Continuous monitoring plan must require developer to perform configuration
  management during system, component or service design, development,
  implementation, and/or operation.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  contracts/agreements to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  requires that the developer of the information system, system component, or
  information system service document the integrity of changes to configuration
  items under configuration management defined in SA-10, CCI 3159.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (This control is about the Defense
  Unicorns (developer) following config management during development of UDS and
  its packages. As a consumer deploying UDS, the organization benefits from all
  provided updates to the software but the organization is not directly involved
  in the configuration management during the development of UDS.)
