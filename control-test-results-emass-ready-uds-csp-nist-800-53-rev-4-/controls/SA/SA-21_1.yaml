  Description:

  The organization requires that the developer of [Assignment:
  organization-defined information system, system component, or information
  system service]:

  a. Have appropriate access authorizations as determined by assigned
  [Assignment: organization-defined official government duties]; and

  b. Satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined additional personnel screening
  criteria].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Because the information system, system component, or information system
  service may be employed in critical activities essential to the national
  and/or economic security interests of the United States, organizations have a
  strong interest in ensuring that the developer is trustworthy. The degree of
  trust required of the developer may need to be consistent with that of the
  individuals accessing the information system/component/service once deployed.
  Examples of authorization and personnel screening criteria include clearance,
  satisfactory background checks, citizenship, and nationality. Trustworthiness
  of developers may also include a review and analysis of company ownership and
  any relationships the company has with entities potentially affecting the
  quality/reliability of the systems, components, or services being developed.
  Related controls: PS-3, PS-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; personnel
  security policy and procedures; procedures addressing personnel screening;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; list of appropriate access
  authorizations required by developers of the information system; personnel
  screening criteria and associated documentation; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and services
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibility for
  developer screening].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for developer screening;
  automated mechanisms supporting developer screening].

  003384: The organization defines the information system, system component, or
  information system service which require the information system developer to
  have appropriate access authorizations and satisfy additional personnel
  screening criteria.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the
  information system, system component, or information system service which
  require the information system developer to have appropriate access
  authorizations and satisfy additional personnel screening criteria. DoD has
  determined the information system, system component, or information system
  service is not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP).

  2.) System development life cycle (SDLC) documentation.

  3.) Continuous monitoring plan that defines the information system, system
  component, or information system service which require the information system
  developers to have appropriate access authorizations and satisfy additional
  personnel screening criteria.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented information system, system component, or information system service
  to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed defines the information
  system, system component, or information system service which require the
  information system developer to have appropriate access authorizations and
  satisfy additional personnel screening criteria. DoD has determined the
  information system, system component, or information system service is not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
