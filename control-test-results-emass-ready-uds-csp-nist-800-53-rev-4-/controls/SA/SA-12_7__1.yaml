control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization conducts an assessment of the information system, system
  component, or information system service prior to selection, acceptance, or
  update.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Assessments include, for example, testing, evaluations, reviews, and analyses.
  Independent, third-party entities or organizational personnel conduct
  assessments of systems, components, products, tools, and services.
  Organizations conduct assessments to uncover unintentional vulnerabilities and
  intentional vulnerabilities including, for example, malicious code, malicious
  processes, defective software, and counterfeits. Assessments can include, for
  example, static analyses, dynamic analyses, simulations, white, gray, and
  black box testing, fuzz testing, penetration testing, and ensuring that
  components or services are genuine (e.g., using tags, cryptographic hash
  verifications, or digital signatures). Evidence generated during security
  assessments is documented for follow-on actions carried out by organizations.
  Related controls: CA-2, SA-11.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing supply chain protection; procedures addressing the integration of
  information security requirements into the acquisition process; security test
  and evaluation results; vulnerability assessment results; penetration testing
  results; organizational risk assessment results; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and services
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with supply chain
  protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for conducting assessments prior
  to selection, acceptance, or update; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing the conducting of assessments prior to selection, acceptance, or
  update].

  003203: The organization conducts an assessment of the information system,
  system component, or information system service prior to selection,
  acceptance, or update.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed or an independent, third-party
  entity must perform and document assessments that may include static analyses,
  dynamic analyses, simulations, white, gray, and black box testing, fuzz
  testing, penetration testing, and ensure that components or services are
  genuine (e.g., using tags, cryptographic hash verifications, or digital
  signatures). Where possible, testing should employ threat profiles based on
  the threats that the system is likely to face in the operational environment.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP).

  2.) System development life cycle (SDLC) documentation.

  3.) Continuous monitoring plan for assessment of the information system,
  system components or information systems services prior to selection,
  acceptance or updates.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines
  documented assessment(s) that were conducted by the organization prior to
  selection, acceptance, or update to ensure that the organization being
  inspected/assessed is assessing information systems, system components, or
  information system services prior to selection, acceptance, or update.

test-results: "Though the majority of this control would require an external assessment i.e. penetration testing on UDS. UDS does provide the functionality to ensure components are genuine. Integrity validation of the software components is a core part of UDS deployment. As mentioned, Zarf packages can be signed and Zarf will verify the package signature and contents before deploying. Each container image has a cryptographic hash (digest); Zarf and Kubernetes ensure that the exact images (by digest) are deployed, preventing tampering. Additionally, the UDS CLI and Zarf have features to verify package checksums and signatures using keysâ\x80\x8B. If any component were altered, the signature check would fail or the hash wouldn't match, and UDS wouldn't install it. This ensures the softwareâ\x80\x99s integrity at installation."
