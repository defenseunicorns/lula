  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Limits the use of commercially provided information assurance (IA) and
  IA-enabled information technology products to those products that have been
  successfully evaluated against a National Information Assurance partnership
  (NIAP)-approved Protection Profile for a specific technology type, if such a
  profile exists; and

  (b) Requires, if no NIAP-approved Protection Profile exists for a specific
  technology type but a commercially provided information technology product
  relies on cryptographic functionality to enforce its security policy, that the
  cryptographic module is FIPS-validated.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related controls: SC-12, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing the integration of information security requirements, descriptions,
  and criteria into the acquisition process; solicitation documents; acquisition
  documentation; acquisition contracts for the information system, system
  component, or information system service; NAIP-approved protection profiles;
  FIPS-validation information for cryptographic functionality; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with acquisition/contracting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibility for determining
  information system security requirements; organizational personnel responsible
  for ensuring information assurance products are have been evaluated against a
  NIAP-approved protection profile or for ensuring products relying on
  cryptographic functionality are FIPS-validated; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for selecting and employing
  products/services evaluated against a NIAP-approved protection profile or
  FIPS-validated products].

  000634: The organization limits the use of commercially provided information
  assurance (IA) and IA-enabled information technology products to those
  products that have been successfully evaluated against a National Information
  Assurance partnership (NIAP)-approved Protection Profile for a specific
  technology type, if such a profile exists.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed, when using commercially provided IA
  and IA-enabled IT products uses only products that have been successfully
  evaluated against a National Information Assurance partnership (NIAP)-approved
  Protection Profile for a specific technology type, if such a profile exists.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP).

  2.) System development life cycle (SDLC) documentation includes information as
  it relates to commercially provided IA or IA enabled IT products.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  hardware and software lists to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed, when using commercially provided IA and IA-enabled IT
  products uses only products that have been successfully evaluated against a
  National Information Assurance partnership (NIAP)-approved Protection Profile
  for a specific technology type, if such a profile exists.

  because it uses FIPS-validated modules.)
