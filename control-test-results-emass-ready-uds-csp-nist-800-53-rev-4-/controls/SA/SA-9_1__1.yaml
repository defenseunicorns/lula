  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing external information system services; acquisition documentation;
  acquisition contracts for the information system, system component, or
  information system service; risk assessment reports; approval records for
  acquisition or outsourcing of dedicated information security services; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and services
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information system
  security responsibilities; external providers of information system services;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for conducting a risk assessment
  prior to acquiring or outsourcing dedicated information security services;
  organizational processes for approving the outsourcing of dedicated
  information security services; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing risk assessment; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing approval processes].
