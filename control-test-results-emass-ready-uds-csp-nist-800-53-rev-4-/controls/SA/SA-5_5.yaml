  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Obtains administrator documentation for the information system, system
  component, or information system service that describes:

  1. Secure configuration, installation, and operation of the system, component,
  or service;

  2. Effective use and maintenance of security functions/mechanisms; and

  3. Known vulnerabilities regarding configuration and use of administrative
  (i.e., privileged) functions;

  b. Obtains user documentation for the information system, system component, or
  information system service that describes:

  1. User-accessible security functions/mechanisms and how to effectively use
  those security functions/mechanisms;

  2. Methods for user interaction, which enables individuals to use the system,
  component, or service in a more secure manner; and

  3. User responsibilities in maintaining the security of the system, component,
  or service;

  c. Documents attempts to obtain information system, system component, or
  information system service documentation when such documentation is either
  unavailable or nonexistent and [Assignment: organization-defined actions] in
  response;

  d. Protects documentation as required, in accordance with the risk management
  strategy; and

  e. Distributes documentation to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
  roles].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control helps organizational personnel understand the implementation and
  operation of security controls associated with information systems, system
  components, and information system services. Organizations consider
  establishing specific measures to determine the quality/completeness of the
  content provided. The inability to obtain needed documentation may occur, for
  example, due to the age of the information system/component or lack of support
  from developers and contractors. In those situations, organizations may need
  to recreate selected documentation if such documentation is essential to the
  effective implementation or operation of security controls. The level of
  protection provided for selected information system, component, or service
  documentation is commensurate with the security category or classification of
  the system. For example, documentation associated with a key DoD weapons
  system or command and control system would typically require a higher level of
  protection than a routine administrative system. Documentation that addresses
  information system vulnerabilities may also require an increased level of
  protection. Secure operation of the information system, includes, for example,
  initially starting the system and resuming secure system operation after any
  lapse in system operation. Related controls: CM-6, CM-8, PL-2, PL-4, PS-2,
  SA-3, SA-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing information system documentation; information system documentation
  including administrator and user guides; records documenting attempts to
  obtain unavailable or nonexistent information system documentation; list of
  actions to be taken in response to documented attempts to obtain information
  system, system component, or information system service documentation; risk
  management strategy documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with acquisition/contracting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibility for determining
  information system security requirements; system administrators;
  organizational personnel operating, using, and/or maintaining the information
  system; information system developers; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for obtaining, protecting, and
  distributing information system administrator and user documentation].

  003128: The organization obtains administrator documentation for the
  information system, system component, or information system services that
  describes known vulnerabilities regarding configuration and use of
  administrative (i.e. privileged) functions.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents within
  contracts/agreements, requirements that the developer provide administrator
  documentation for the information system, system component or information
  system service that describe known vulnerabilities regarding configuration and
  use of administrative (i.e. privileged) functions.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP) must contain administrator documentation that
  describes known vulnerabilities regarding configuration and used of
  administrative(privileged) functions.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  contracts/agreements to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  requires that the developer provide administrator documentation for the
  information system, system component or information system service that
  describe known vulnerabilities regarding configuration and use of
  administrative (i.e. privileged) functions.
