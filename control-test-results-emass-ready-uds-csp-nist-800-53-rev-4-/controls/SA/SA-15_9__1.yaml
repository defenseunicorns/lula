control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization approves, documents, and controls the use of live data in
  development and test environments for the information system, system
  component, or information system service.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The use of live data in preproduction environments can result in significant
  risk to organizations. Organizations can minimize such risk by using test or
  dummy data during the development and testing of information systems,
  information system components, and information system services.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing development process, standards, and tools; solicitation
  documentation; acquisition documentation; service-level agreements;
  acquisition contracts for the information system, system component, or
  information system service; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  documentation authorizing use of live data in development and test
  environments; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and services
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for approving, documenting, and
  controlling the use of live data in development and test environments;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the approval,
  documentation, and control of the use of live data in development and test
  environments].

  003283: The organization approves the use of live data in development
  environments for the information system, system component, or information
  system service.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to approve the use of live data in development environments for the
  information system, system component, or information system service. The
  organization must maintain a record of approvals.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP).

  2.) System development life cycle (SDLC) documentation.

  3.) Continuous monitoring plan approves the use of live data in development
  environments for the information system, system components or information
  system service.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented process as well as the record of approvals to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed approves the use of live data in
  development environments for the information system, system component, or
  information system service.
