  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Requires that providers of external information system services comply with
  organizational information security requirements and employ [Assignment:
  organization-defined security controls] in accordance with applicable federal
  laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
  guidance;

  b. Defines and documents government oversight and user roles and
  responsibilities with regard to external information system services; and

  c. Employs [Assignment: organization-defined processes, methods, and
  techniques] to monitor security control compliance by external service
  providers on an ongoing basis.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  External information system services are services that are implemented outside
  of the authorization boundaries of organizational information systems. This
  includes services that are used by, but not a part of, organizational
  information systems. FISMA and OMB policy require that organizations using
  external service providers that are processing, storing, or transmitting
  federal information or operating information systems on behalf of the federal
  government ensure that such providers meet the same security requirements that
  federal agencies are required to meet. Organizations establish relationships
  with external service providers in a variety of ways including, for example,
  through joint ventures, business partnerships, contracts, interagency
  agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, and supply
  chain exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of
  external information system services remains with authorizing officials. For
  services external to organizations, a chain of trust requires that
  organizations establish and retain a level of confidence that each
  participating provider in the potentially complex consumer-provider
  relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered. The
  extent and nature of this chain of trust varies based on the relationships
  between organizations and the external providers. Organizations document the
  basis for trust relationships so the relationships can be monitored over time.
  External information system services documentation includes government,
  service providers, end user security roles and responsibilities, and
  service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define expectations of
  performance for security controls, describe measurable outcomes, and identify
  remedies and response requirements for identified instances of noncompliance.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing external information system services; procedures addressing methods
  and techniques for monitoring security control compliance by external service
  providers of information system services; acquisition contracts, service-level
  agreements; organizational security requirements and security specifications
  for external provider services; security control assessment evidence from
  external providers of information system services; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and services
  acquisition responsibilities; external providers of information system
  services; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for monitoring security control
  compliance by external service providers on an ongoing basis; automated
  mechanisms for monitoring security control compliance by external service
  providers on an ongoing basis].

  000674: The organization documents user roles and responsibilities with regard
  to external information system services.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed must establish in the official
  documentation governing the provision of the external IT services (e.g.
  contract, MOU, MOA, SLA, etc.) the roles and responsibilities of all types of
  users of the external information system services.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP) must document user roles and responsibilities
  with regards to external information services (includes contracts, MOUs, MOAs,
  SLAs).
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  official documentation governing the provision of the external IT services
  (e.g. contract, MOU, MOA, SLA, etc.) to confirm the organization has clearly
  established the roles and responsibilities of all types of users of the
  external information system services.
