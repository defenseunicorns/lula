family: SA
control-acronym: SA-19
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Develops and implements anti-counterfeit policy and procedures that include
  the means to detect and prevent counterfeit components from entering the
  information system; and

  b. Reports counterfeit information system components to [Selection (one or
  more): source of counterfeit component; [Assignment: organization-defined
  external reporting organizations]; [Assignment: organization-defined personnel
  or roles]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Sources of counterfeit components include, for example, manufacturers,
  developers, vendors, and contractors. Anti-counterfeiting policy and
  procedures support tamper resistance and provide a level of protection against
  the introduction of malicious code. External reporting organizations include,
  for example, US-CERT. Related controls: PE-3, SA-12, SI-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy;
  anti-counterfeit policy and procedures; media disposal policy; media
  protection policy; incident response policy; training materials addressing
  counterfeit information system components; training records on detection and
  prevention of counterfeit components from entering the information system;
  reports notifying developers/manufacturers/vendors/ contractors and/or
  external reporting organizations of counterfeit information system components;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and services
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibility for
  anti-counterfeit policy, procedures, and reporting].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for anti-counterfeit detection,
  prevention, and reporting; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  anti-counterfeit detection, prevention, and reporting].

  003356: The organization develops anti-counterfeit policy that include the
  means to detect counterfeit components from entering the information system.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed develops and documents an
  anti-counterfeit policy that include the means to detect counterfeit
  components from entering the information system.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP).

  2.) System development life cycle (SDLC) documentation.

  3.) Continuous monitoring plan for developing anti-counterfeit policy that
  include the means to detect counterfeit components from entering the
  information system.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented anti-counterfeit policy to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed develops an anti-counterfeit policy that include the means
  to detect counterfeit components from entering the information system.
