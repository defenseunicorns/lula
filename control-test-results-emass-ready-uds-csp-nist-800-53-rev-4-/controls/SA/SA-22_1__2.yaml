  Description:

  The organization provides [Selection (one or more): in-house support;
  [Assignment: organization-defined support from external providers]] for
  unsupported information system components.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement addresses the need to provide continued support for
  selected information system components that are no longer supported by the
  original developers, vendors, or manufacturers when such components remain
  essential to mission/business operations. Organizations can establish in-house
  support, for example, by developing customized patches for critical software
  components or secure the services of external providers who through
  contractual relationships, provide ongoing support for the designated
  unsupported components. Such contractual relationships can include, for
  example, Open Source Software value-added vendors.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing support for unsupported information system components; solicitation
  documentation; acquisition documentation; acquisition contracts; service-level
  agreements; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and services
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibility system
  development life cycle; organizational personnel or third-party external
  providers supporting information system components no longer supported by
  original developers, vendors, or manufacturers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for supporting system components
  no longer supported by original developers, vendors, or manufacturers;
  automated mechanisms providing support for system components no longer
  supported by original developers, vendors, or manufacturers].
