control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization requires the developer of the information system, system
  component, or information system service to provide design and implementation
  information for the security controls to be employed that includes: [Selection
  (one or more): security-relevant external system interfaces; high-level
  design; low-level design; source code or hardware schematics; [Assignment:
  organization-defined design/implementation information]] at [Assignment:
  organization-defined level of detail].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations may require different levels of detail in design and
  implementation documentation for security controls employed in organizational
  information systems, system components, or information system services based
  on mission/business requirements, requirements for trustworthiness/resiliency,
  and requirements for analysis and testing. Information systems can be
  partitioned into multiple subsystems. Each subsystem within the system can
  contain one or more modules. The high-level design for the system is expressed
  in terms of multiple subsystems and the interfaces between subsystems
  providing security-relevant functionality. The low-level design for the system
  is expressed in terms of modules with particular emphasis on software and
  firmware (but not excluding hardware) and the interfaces between modules
  providing security-relevant functionality. Source code and hardware schematics
  are typically referred to as the implementation representation of the
  information system. Related control: SA-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing the integration of information security requirements, descriptions,
  and criteria into the acquisition process; solicitation documents; acquisition
  documentation; acquisition contracts for the information system, system
  components, or information system services; design and implementation
  information for security controls employed in the information system, system
  component, or information system service; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with acquisition/contracting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibility for determining
  information system security requirements; information system developer or
  service provider; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for determining level of detail
  for system design and security controls; organizational processes for
  developing acquisition contracts; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing development of system design details].

  003105: The organization defines the level of detail the design information of
  the security controls is required to be provided by the developer of the
  information system, system component, or information system services.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the level of
  detail the design information of the security controls is required to be
  provided by the developer of the information system, system component, or
  information system services. DoD has determined the level of detail is not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP) defines level of detail required in design
  information of all security controls, to be provided by developer of
  information system, component, or service.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented level of detail to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  defines the level of detail the design information of the security controls is
  required to be provided by the developer of the information system, system
  component, or information system services. DoD has determined the level of
  detail is not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
