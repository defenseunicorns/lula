  Description:

  The information system accepts only FICAM-approved third-party credentials.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement typically applies to organizational information
  systems that are accessible to the general public, for example, public-facing
  websites. Third-party credentials are those credentials issued by nonfederal
  government entities approved by the Federal Identity, Credential, and Access
  Management (FICAM) Trust Framework Solutions initiative. Approved third-party
  credentials meet or exceed the set of minimum federal government-wide
  technical, security, privacy, and organizational maturity requirements. This
  allows federal government relying parties to trust such credentials at their
  approved assurance levels. Related control: AU-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing user identification and authentication; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; list of FICAM-approved,
  third-party credentialing products, components, or services procured and
  implemented by organization; third-party credential verification records;
  evidence of FICAM-approved third-party credentials; third-party credential
  authorizations; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  operations responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers;
  organizational personnel with account management responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  identification and authentication capability; automated mechanisms that accept
  FICAM-approved credentials].

cci-definition: '002011: The information system accepts FICAM-approved third-party credentials.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  accept Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM)-approved
  third-party credentials. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 2011. FICAM Guidance is
  available at http://www.idmanagement.gov.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP documentation configuring the information system
  to accept Federal Identify, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM)-approved
  third-party credentials.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to accept FICAM-approved third-party credentials For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 2011.

(UDS employs the Keycloak identity management component, which supports authentication integration with FICAM-approved identity and credentialing solutions, including DoD-approved PKI (such as CAC and PIV) and other FICAM-approved external credential providers. Keycloak itself provides the necessary technical capabilities√¢\x80\x94such as certificate-based authentication, validation, and federation with approved identity providers to meet FICAM compliance requirements. However, explicit verification and formal documentation of Keycloak as a FICAM-approved component, or integrating it explicitly with approved FICAM-compliant identity services, remain organizational responsibilities.)"
