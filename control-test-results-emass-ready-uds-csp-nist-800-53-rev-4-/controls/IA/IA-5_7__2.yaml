  Description:

  The organization ensures that unencrypted static authenticators are not
  embedded in applications or access scripts or stored on function keys.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations exercise caution in determining whether embedded or stored
  authenticators are in encrypted or unencrypted form. If authenticators are
  used in the manner stored, then those representations are considered
  unencrypted authenticators. This is irrespective of whether that
  representation is perhaps an encrypted version of something else (e.g., a
  password).


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing authenticator management; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  logical access scripts; application code reviews for detecting unencrypted
  static authenticators; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with authenticator
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  authenticator management capability; automated mechanisms implementing
  authentication in applications].

  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements
  requirements that unencrypted static authenticators not be stored on function
  keys.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP documenting that unencrypted static
  authenticators not be stored on function keys.

  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  requirements that unencrypted static authenticators not be stored on function
  keys to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed ensures unencrypted
  static authenticators are not stored on function keys.

test-results: >-
  In UDS, unencrypted static authenticators are never stored on function keys.
  Instead, any credentials or secrets required by function keys are securely
  encrypted and managed via mechanisms such as Kubernetes Secrets and secure
  vault integrations. UDS does not utilize or support the storage of unencrypted
  static authenticators (e.g., passwords or tokens) on hardware-based function
  keys or programmable keys. Authentication within UDS is managed centrally
  through Keycloak, employing secure digital certificates, multifactor
  authentication (e.g., CAC/PIV cards), and cryptographically secured tokens.
