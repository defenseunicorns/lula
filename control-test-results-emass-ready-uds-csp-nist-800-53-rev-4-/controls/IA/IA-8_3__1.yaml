  Description:

  The organization employs only FICAM-approved information system components in
  [Assignment: organization-defined information systems] to accept third-party
  credentials.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement typically applies to information systems that are
  accessible to the general public, for example, public-facing websites.
  FICAM-approved information system components include, for example, information
  technology products and software libraries that have been approved by the
  Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management conformance program.
  Related control: SA-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; system and
  services acquisition policy; procedures addressing user identification and
  authentication; procedures addressing the integration of security requirements
  into the acquisition process; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; third-party credential validations;
  third-party credential authorizations; third-party credential records; list of
  FICAM-approved information system components procured and implemented by
  organization; acquisition documentation; acquisition contracts for information
  system procurements or services; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  operations responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with account management responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with information system security, acquisition, and contracting
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  identification and authentication capability].

  002012: The organization defines the information systems which will employ
  only FICAM-approved information system components.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the
  information systems which will employ only Federal Identity, Credential, and
  Access Management (FICAM)-approved information system components. DoD has
  determined the information systems are not appropriate to define at the
  Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP documentation defining the information systems
  which will employ only Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management
  (FICAM)-approved information system components
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented information systems to ensure they have been defined. DoD has
  determined the information systems are not appropriate to define at the
  Enterprise level.

test-results: "Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS employs the Keycloak identity management component, which supports authentication integration with FICAM-approved identity and credentialing solutions, including DoD-approved PKI (such as CAC and PIV) and other FICAM-approved external credential providers. Keycloak itself provides the necessary technical capabilities√¢\x80\x94such as certificate-based authentication, validation, and federation with approved identity providers to meet FICAM compliance requirements. However, explicit verification and formal documentation of Keycloak as a FICAM-approved component, or integrating it explicitly with approved FICAM-compliant identity services, remain organizational responsibilities.)"
