  Description:

  The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates [Assignment:
  organization-defined specific and/or types of devices] before establishing a
  [Selection (one or more): local; remote; network] connection.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizational devices requiring unique device-to-device identification and
  authentication may be defined by type, by device, or by a combination of
  type/device. Information systems typically use either shared known information
  (e.g., Media Access Control [MAC] or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
  Protocol [TCP/IP] addresses) for device identification or organizational
  authentication solutions (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible Authentication
  Protocol [EAP], Radius server with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS]
  authentication, Kerberos) to identify/authenticate devices on local and/or
  wide area networks. Organizations determine the required strength of
  authentication mechanisms by the security categories of information systems.
  Because of the challenges of applying this control on large scale,
  organizations are encouraged to only apply the control to those limited number
  (and type) of devices that truly need to support this capability. Related
  controls: AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, CA-3, IA-4, IA-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing device identification and authentication; information system design
  documentation; list of devices requiring unique identification and
  authentication; device connection reports; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with operational
  responsibilities for device identification and authentication; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system/network
  administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing device
  identification and authentication capability].

  000778: The information system uniquely identifies an organization defined
  list of specific and/or types of devices before establishing a local, remote,
  or network connection.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the network
  infrastructure to identify all mobile devices and network connected endpoint
  devices (including but not limited to: workstations, printers, servers
  (outside a datacenter), VoIP Phones, VTC CODECs) before establishing a local,
  remote, network connection. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 778. DoD has defined
  the value as all mobile devices and network connected endpoint devices
  (including but not limited to: workstations, printers, servers (outside a
  datacenter), VoIP Phones, VTC CODECs). Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) List identifying all mobile devices and network connected endpoint devices
  (including but not limited to: workstations, printers, servers (outside a
  datacenter), VoIP Phones, VTC CODECs) before establishing a local remote
  network connection.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examine a sampling of
  the network infrastructure device configurations to ensure devices connecting
  to the infrastructure are uniquely identified. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 778.

test-results: "Device authentication is handled in UDS through mutual TLS and certificate-based trust between components. Each server/node in the Kubernetes cluster has its own credentials (certificates for the kubelet, etc.) and each service in the service mesh has a certificate identity (issued by Istioâ\x80\x99s Citadel). These certificates are used to authenticate machines and services to each other. For example, when Service A connects to Service B within the mesh, it presents its certificate and Bâ\x80\x99s sidecar verifies it only if itâ\x80\x99s a valid known service cert will communication proceed. This means that devices and applications are being authenticated at the network layer without user involvement."
