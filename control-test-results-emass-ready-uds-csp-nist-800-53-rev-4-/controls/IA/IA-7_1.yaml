  Description:

  The information system implements mechanisms for authentication to a
  cryptographic module that meet the requirements of applicable federal laws,
  Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance
  for such authentication.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Authentication mechanisms may be required within a cryptographic module to
  authenticate an operator accessing the module and to verify that the operator
  is authorized to assume the requested role and perform services within that
  role. Related controls: SC-12, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  addressing cryptographic module authentication; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  cryptographic module authentication; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].

  000803: The information system implements mechanisms for authentication to a
  cryptographic module that meet the requirements of applicable federal laws,
  Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance
  for such authentication.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  implement mechanisms for authentication to a cryptographic module that meet
  the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
  policies, regulations, standards, and guidance for such authentication. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 803.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP documenting organization's configuration of the
  information system to implement mechanisms for authentication to a
  cryptographic module that meet the requirements of applicable federal laws,
  EO, directives, policies, regulations, standards and guidance for such
  authentication.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to implement mechanisms for authentication to a
  cryptographic module that meet the requirements of applicable federal laws,
  Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance
  for such authentication. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 803.

  UDS components use cryptographic modules that meet federal standards (FIPS
  140-2) when configured for secure environments. For example, Istio can be
  deployed with FIPS-validated crypto libraries, and the Linux operating
  environment can be in FIPS mode. Keycloak and other components support
  FIPS-compliant algorithms for TLS and hashing.
