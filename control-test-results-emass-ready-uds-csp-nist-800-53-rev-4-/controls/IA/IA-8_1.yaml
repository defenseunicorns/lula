  Description:

  The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates
  non-organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of non-organizational
  users).


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Non-organizational users include information system users other than
  organizational users explicitly covered by IA-2. These individuals are
  uniquely identified and authenticated for accesses other than those accesses
  explicitly identified and documented in AC-14. In accordance with the
  E-Authentication E-Government initiative, authentication of non-organizational
  users accessing federal information systems may be required to protect
  federal, proprietary, or privacy-related information (with exceptions noted
  for national security systems). Organizations use risk assessments to
  determine authentication needs and consider scalability, practicality, and
  security in balancing the need to ensure ease of use for access to federal
  information and information systems with the need to protect and adequately
  mitigate risk. IA-2 addresses identification and authentication requirements
  for access to information systems by organizational users. Related controls:
  AC-2, AC-14, AC-17, AC-18, IA-2, IA-4, IA-5, MA-4, RA-3, SA-12, SC-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing user identification and authentication; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; list of information system
  accounts; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  operations responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with account management responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  identification and authentication capability].

  000804: The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates
  non-organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of non-organizational
  users).
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  uniquely identify and authenticate non-organizational users (or processes
  acting on behalf of non-organizational users). For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  804.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP documenting configuration of the information
  system to uniquely identify and authenticate non-organizational users (or
  processes acting on behalf of non-organizational users)

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG CHECKS.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to uniquely identify and authenticate non-organizational
  users (or processes acting on behalf of non-organizational users). For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 804.

test-results: "Identification and authentication of non-organizational users (e.g., guest users, federation partners) can be handled by UDS through Keycloak. Keycloak supports setting up separate user realms or groups for external users and applying different authentication requirements to them. For instance, if external partner users need to access a certain application, they can be put in a separate realm or marked with an attribute, and Keycloak can enforce that they use their own credentials or an agreed federation (such as logging in via their home organizationâ\x80\x99s IdP which Keycloak trusts). Keycloakâ\x80\x99s identity brokering capabilityâ\x80\x8B is very useful here: UDS can accept identities from external identity providers (e.g. SAML/OIDC provider) without issuing local accounts, meaning external users are authenticated via their organization but still identified to UDS."
