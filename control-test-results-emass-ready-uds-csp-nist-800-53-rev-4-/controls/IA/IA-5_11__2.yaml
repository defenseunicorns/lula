  Description:

  The information system, for hardware token-based authentication, employs
  mechanisms that satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined token quality
  requirements].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Hardware token-based authentication typically refers to the use of PKI-based
  tokens, such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card.
  Organizations define specific requirements for tokens, such as working with a
  particular PKI.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  002003: The information system, for token-based authentication, employs
  mechanisms that satisfy organization-defined token quality requirements.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The information system performing hardware token-based authentication must be
  configured to accept only DoD-approved PKI credentials in accordance with DoDI
  8520.02 and DoDI 8520.03. For unclassified systems, DoD-approved PKI
  credentials include DoD PKI credentials, External Certification Authority
  (ECA) PKI credentials, and DoD-approved external PKI credentials. For SIPRNet,
  DoD-approved PKI credentials include DoD PKI credentials and NSS PKI
  credentials. If the information system accepts DoD-approved external PKI
  credentials, the information system must be configured to accept only
  certificates at approved assurance levels, as represented by the Certificate
  Policy Object Identifiers (OIDs) asserted in the certificate. The current list
  of DoD-approved external PKIs and acceptable Object Identifiers (OIDs) for
  each approved external PKI is available at
  http://iase.disa.mil/pki-pke/interoperability.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP documenting the information system is configured
  to accept only DoD-approved PKI credentials IAW DoDI 8520.02 and DoDI 8520.03.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system to accept only DoD-approved PKI credentials in accordance
  with (IAW) DoDI 8520.02 and DoDI 8520.03. If the information system accepts
  DoD-approved external PKI credentials, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment examines the information system to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed has configured the information system to
  accept only DoD-approved external PKI credentials that assert an approved
  Certificate Policy OID and reject credentials issued off of DoD-approved
  external PKIs that do not assert an approved OID.

test-results: "In UDS, token-based authentication is engineered to meet organization-defined token quality requirements by enforcing the use of only DoD-approved PKI credentials. Keycloak is configured to accept and validate certificates in accordance with DoDI 8520.02 and DoDI 8520.03. For unclassified systems, this means accepting DoD PKI credentials, External Certification Authority (ECA) PKI credentials, and other DoD-approved external PKI credentials, while for SIPRNet deployments only DoD PKI and NSS PKI credentials are permitted. When external PKI credentials are accepted, Keycloak verifies that the certificate includes the required Certificate Policy Object Identifiers (OIDs) that represent approved assurance levels. Additionally, Istio√¢\x80\x99s mutual TLS is used to secure service-to-service communications by ensuring that only tokens derived from these validated certificates are accepted."
