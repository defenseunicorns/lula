  Description:

  The information system dynamically provisions identities.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Authentication requires some form of binding between an identity and the
  authenticator used to confirm the identity. In conventional approaches, this
  binding is established by pre-provisioning both the identity and the
  authenticator to the information system. For example, the binding between a
  username (i.e., identity) and a password (i.e., authenticator) is accomplished
  by provisioning the identity and authenticator as a pair in the information
  system. New authentication techniques allow the binding between the identity
  and the authenticator to be implemented outside an information system. For
  example, with smartcard credentials, the identity and the authenticator are
  bound together on the card. Using these credentials, information systems can
  authenticate identities that have not been pre-provisioned, dynamically
  provisioning the identity after authentication. In these situations,
  organizations can anticipate the dynamic provisioning of identities.
  Preestablished trust relationships and mechanisms with appropriate authorities
  to validate identities and related credentials are essential.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing identifier management; security plan; information system design
  documentation; automated mechanisms providing dynamic binding of identifiers
  and authenticators; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with identifier management
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing identifier management
  capability; automated mechanisms implementing dynamic provisioning of
  identifiers].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  dynamically provision identities. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 2001.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP configuring the information system to dynamically
  provision identities.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to dynamically provision identities. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 2001.

  UDS supports dynamic identity provisioning through its integrated identity
  management platform, Keycloak. Keycloak enables automated, dynamic
  provisioning and de-provisioning of user identities, roles, and associated
  permissions via integration with organizational identity sources (e.g.,
  LDAP/Active Directory or DoD-approved identity providers). Keycloak can
  provision identities dynamically using federation or automated synchronization
  mechanisms, ensuring identities and permissions are immediately available
  across the UDS platform upon user onboarding or changes in user status.
