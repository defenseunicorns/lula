  Description:

  The information system prohibits the use of cached authenticators after
  [Assignment: organization-defined time period].


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing authenticator management; security plan; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with authenticator
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  authenticator management capability].

cci-definition: >-
  002006: The organization defines the time period after which the use of cached
  authenticators are prohibited.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the time
  period after which the use of cached authenticators are prohibited. DoD has
  determined the time period is not appropriate to define at the Enterprise
  level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP documenting and defining the time period after
  which the use of cached authenticators are prohibited.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented time period to ensure it has been defined. DoD has determined the
  time period is not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
