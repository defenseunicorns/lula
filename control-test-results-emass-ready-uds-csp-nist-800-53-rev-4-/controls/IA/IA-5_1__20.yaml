  Description:

  The information system, for password-based authentication:

  (a) Enforces minimum password complexity of [Assignment: organization-defined
  requirements for case sensitivity, number of characters, mix of upper-case
  letters, lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters, including
  minimum requirements for each type];

  (b) Enforces at least the following number of changed characters when new
  passwords are created: [Assignment: organization-defined number];

  (c) Stores and transmits only cryptographically-protected passwords;

  (d) Enforces password minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions of
  [Assignment: organization-defined numbers for lifetime minimum, lifetime
  maximum];

  (e) Prohibits password reuse for [Assignment: organization-defined number]
  generations; and

  (f) Allows the use of a temporary password for system logons with an immediate
  change to a permanent password.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement applies to single-factor authentication of
  individuals using passwords as individual or group authenticators, and in a
  similar manner, when passwords are part of multifactor authenticators. This
  control enhancement does not apply when passwords are used to unlock hardware
  authenticators (e.g., Personal Identity Verification cards). The
  implementation of such password mechanisms may not meet all of the
  requirements in the enhancement. Cryptographically-protected passwords
  include, for example, encrypted versions of passwords and one-way
  cryptographic hashes of passwords. The number of changed characters refers to
  the number of changes required with respect to the total number of positions
  in the current password. Password lifetime restrictions do not apply to
  temporary passwords. To mitigate certain brute force attacks against
  passwords, organizations may also consider salting passwords. Related control:
  IA-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; password
  policy; procedures addressing authenticator management; security plan;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; password configurations and associated
  documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with authenticator
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information

  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  password-based authenticator management capability].

  002041: The information system allows the use of a temporary password for
  system logons with an immediate change to a permanent password.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  allow the use of a temporary password for system logons with an immediate
  change to a permanent password. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 2041.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Key Management Policy that allows the use of a temporary
  password for system logons with an immediate change to a permanent password.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to allow the use of a temporary password for system logons
  with an immediate change to a permanent password. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 2041.

test-results: "In UDS, the system supports the use of temporary passwords for initial logon while enforcing an immediate change to a permanent password. This is implemented through Keycloakâ\x80\x99s built-in account management features, which allow administrators to provision accounts with a temporary password and configure the system to require a password update at the first logon. Once a user logs in using the temporary credential, they are automatically prompted to create a new, permanent password that meets the organizationâ\x80\x99s security policies. This process is integrated into the user provisioning workflow and is tracked via audit logs to ensure compliance with security requirements."
