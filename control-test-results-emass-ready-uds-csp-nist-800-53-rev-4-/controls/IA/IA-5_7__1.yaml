  Description:

  The organization ensures that unencrypted static authenticators are not
  embedded in applications or access scripts or stored on function keys.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations exercise caution in determining whether embedded or stored
  authenticators are in encrypted or unencrypted form. If authenticators are
  used in the manner stored, then those representations are considered
  unencrypted authenticators. This is irrespective of whether that
  representation is perhaps an encrypted version of something else (e.g., a
  password).


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing authenticator management; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  logical access scripts; application code reviews for detecting unencrypted
  static authenticators; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with authenticator
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  authenticator management capability; automated mechanisms implementing
  authentication in applications].

  embedded in access scripts.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements
  requirements that unencrypted static authenticators not be embedded in access
  scripts.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP documenting implementation requirements that
  unencrypted static authenticators not be embedded in access scripts.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  requirements that unencrypted static authenticators not be embedded in access
  scripts to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed ensures
  unencrypted static authenticators are not embedded in access scripts.

test-results: >-
  In UDS, unencrypted static authenticators are strictly prohibited from being
  embedded in access scripts. Instead, all sensitive credentials are managed
  securely using encrypted storage mechanisms such as Kubernetes Secrets and
  secure vaults integrated with Keycloak and are dynamically injected at
  runtime.
