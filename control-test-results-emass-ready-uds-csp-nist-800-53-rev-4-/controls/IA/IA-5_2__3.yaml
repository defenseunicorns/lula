  Description:

  The information system, for PKI-based authentication

  (a) Validates certifications by constructing and verifying a certification
  path to an accepted trust anchor including checking certificate status
  information;

  (b) Enforces authorized access to the corresponding private key;

  (c) Maps the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group;
  and

  (d) Implements a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and
  validation in case of inability to access revocation information via the
  network.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Status information for certification paths includes, for example, certificate
  revocation lists or certificate status protocol responses. For PIV cards,
  validation of certifications involves the construction and verification of a
  certification path to the Common Policy Root trust anchor including
  certificate policy processing. Related control: IA-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing authenticator management; security plan; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; PKI certification validation records; PKI certification
  revocation lists; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with PKI-based,
  authenticator management responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system
  developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  PKI-based, authenticator management capability].

  000187: The information system, for PKI-based authentication, maps the
  authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The information system performing PKI-based authentication must be configured
  to map the authenticated PKI credential to a corresponding network or
  information system account or role in accordance with DoDI 8520.03. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 187.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP for configuring the information system mapping of
  the authenticated PKI credentials to a corresponding network or information
  system account or role in accordance with DoDI 8520.03.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system to map authenticated PKI credentials to corresponding
  network or information system accounts or roles in accordance with DoDI
  8520.03. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs,
  the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components
  to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 187.

  UDS effectively maps authenticated PKI credentials to user accounts through
  its centralized identity management system, Keycloak, fully aligning with DoDI
  8520.03 requirements. When users authenticate using PKI-based credentials
  (e.g., CAC or PIV), Keycloak validates the presented X.509 certificate and
  automatically maps the validated certificate identity to a corresponding,
  pre-established user account or role within the system. This mapping process
  ensures users receive appropriate permissions and role-based access control
  (RBAC) privileges in accordance with their assigned organizational roles.
  Additionally, Keycloak maintains detailed audit logs of successful and
  unsuccessful authentications and mappings, facilitating traceability and
  compliance auditing.
