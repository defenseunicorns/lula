family: AC
control-acronym: AC-6(7)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Reviews [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] the privileges
  assigned to [Assignment: organization-defined roles or classes of users] to
  validate the need for such privileges; and 

  (b) Reassigns or removes privileges, if necessary, to correctly reflect
  organizational mission/business needs.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The need for certain assigned user privileges may change over time reflecting
  changes in organizational missions/business function, environments of
  operation, technologies, or threat. Periodic review of assigned user
  privileges is necessary to determine if the rationale for assigning such
  privileges remains valid. If the need cannot be revalidated, organizations
  take appropriate corrective actions. Related control: CA-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing least
  privilege; list of system-generated roles or classes of users and assigned
  privileges; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; validation reviews of
  privileges assigned to roles or classes or users; records of privilege
  removals or reassignments for roles or classes of users; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  reviewing least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing review of user
  privileges].

  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to reassign or remove privileges, if necessary, to correctly reflect
  organizational mission/business needs.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation that defines the process to reassign or
  remove privileges, if necessary, to correctly reflect organizational
  mission/business needs.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (While UDS incorporates various
  technologies, such as Keycloak, for creating and managing roles, actual
  reassignments or removed privileges per an organizational business/mission
  need is managed by the organization.)
