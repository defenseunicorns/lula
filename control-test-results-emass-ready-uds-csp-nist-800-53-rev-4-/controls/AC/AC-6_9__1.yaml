  Description:

  The information system audits the execution of privileged functions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by
  authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised
  information system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have
  significant adverse impacts on organizations. Auditing the use of privileged
  functions is one way to detect such misuse, and in doing so, help mitigate the
  risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat (APT). Related
  control: AU-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing least
  privilege; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; list of privileged
  functions to be audited; list of audited events; information system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  reviewing least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms auditing the execution of least
  privilege functions].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  audit the execution of privileged functions. For information system components
  that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed
  must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 2234.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks

  2.) Documentation that shows the system is configured to audit the execution
  of privileged functions
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to audit the execution of privileged functions. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 2234.

  The UDS information system audits the execution of privileged functions to
  detect and mitigate the risk of misuse by authorized users or unauthorized
  external entities. UDS employs Vector for log shipping and Loki for log
  aggregation, which enables the collection and centralization of audit logs.
  These logs can be sent to a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
  system for comprehensive auditing and alerting, depending on the customer's
  setup. This configuration ensures that all privileged functions are monitored,
  and any misuse can be promptly detected and addressed. The auditing process
  includes reviewing access control policies, procedures addressing least
  privilege, and maintaining detailed records of privileged functions and
  audited events. This approach helps mitigate the risk from insider threats and
  advanced persistent threats (APT), ensuring compliance with the control
  requirements.
