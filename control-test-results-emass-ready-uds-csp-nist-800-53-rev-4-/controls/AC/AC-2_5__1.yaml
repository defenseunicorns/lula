  Description:

  The organization requires that users log out when [Assignment:
  organization-defined time-period of expected inactivity or description of when

  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related control: SC-23.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; security plan; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  security violation reports; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; users that must comply with inactivity
  logout policy].

  002133: The organization defines other conditions when users are required to
  log out.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the other
  conditions when users are required to log out. DoD has determined the
  conditions are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation that defines the other organization-defined
  condition requirements for logging out.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented conditions to ensure they have been defined. DoD has determined the
  conditions are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

test-results: "Keycloak fully supports session timeouts through configurable settings that manage the lifecycle of sessions. It allows you to set an SSO session idle timeout, which determines how long a session can remain inactive before being automatically terminated, as well as an SSO session max timeout, which imposes an absolute limit on the session's duration regardless of activity. Additionally, for offline sessions√¢\x80\x94such as those used with \"remember me\" functionality separate configurations exist to manage both idle timeouts and maximum lifespans. These settings are accessible and adjustable through the Keycloak admin console under the realm's token settings, enabling you to tailor session management to meet specific security and user experience requirements."
