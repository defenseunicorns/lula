family: AC
control-acronym: AC-7
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system:

  a. Enforces a limit of [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive
  invalid logon attempts by a user during a [Assignment: organization-defined
  time period]; and

  b. Automatically [Selection: locks the account/node for an [Assignment:
  organization-defined time period]; locks the account/node until released by an
  administrator; delays next logon prompt according to [Assignment:
  organization-defined delay algorithm]] when the maximum number of unsuccessful
  attempts is exceeded.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies regardless of whether the logon occurs via a local or
  network connection. Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic
  lockouts initiated by information systems are usually temporary and
  automatically release after a predetermined time period established by
  organizations. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may choose to
  employ different algorithms for different information system components based
  on the capabilities of those components. Responses to unsuccessful logon
  attempts may be implemented at both the operating system and the application
  levels. Related controls: AC-2, AC-9, AC-14, IA-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing
  unsuccessful logon attempts; security plan; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system developers; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing access control policy
  for unsuccessful logon attempts].

  002238: The information system automatically locks the account or node for
  either an organization-defined time period, until the locked account or node
  is released by an administrator, or delays the next login prompt according to
  the organization-defined delay algorithm when the maximum number of
  unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  automatically lock the account or node until the locked account is released by
  an administrator and delays the next login prompt for a minimum of 5 seconds
  when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  2238. DoD has defined the delay algorithm as a minimum of 5 seconds. DoD has
  defined the time period as until released by an administrator.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated access control policy

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to automatically lock the account or node until the locked
  account is released by an administrator and delays the next login prompt for a
  minimum of 5 seconds when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is
  exceeded. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the
  components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 2238. DoD has defined the delay algorithm as a minimum
  of 5 seconds. DoD has defined the time period as until released by an
  administrator.

  In Keycloak, you can manage account lockout settings by enabling Brute Force
  Detection under Security Defenses in your realm settings. Once enabled,
  specify the maximum number of consecutive login failures (Max Login Failures),
  the initial lockout duration (Wait Increment), the maximum lockout time (Max
  Wait), and how long failed attempts are remembered (Failure Reset Time).
  Adjusting these values controls how quickly users are locked out, how long the
  lockout lasts, and when failure counts are reset, allowing you to balance
  security against user convenience.
