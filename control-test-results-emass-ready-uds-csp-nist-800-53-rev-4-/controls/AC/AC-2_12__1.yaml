  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Monitors information system accounts for [Assignment: organization-defined
  atypical use]; and

  (b) Reports atypical usage of information system accounts to [Assignment:
  organization-defined personnel or roles].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A typical usage includes, for example, accessing information systems at
  certain times of the day and from locations that are not consistent with the
  normal usage patterns of individuals working in organizations. Related
  control: CA-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; information system
  monitoring records; information system audit records; audit tracking and
  monitoring reports; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing account management
  functions].

  002146: The organization defines atypical usage for which the information
  system accounts are to be monitored.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents atypical usage
  for which the information system accounts are to be monitored. DoD has
  determined atypical usage is not appropriate to define at the Enterprise
  level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation which defines atypical usage for which the
  information system accounts are to be monitored.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented atypical usage to ensure it has been defined. DoD has determined
  atypical usage is not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Not applicable to UDS technology stack. (It should be an organizational
  decision on how to define atypical usage for the monitored system though UDS
  provides the monitoring capabilities.)
