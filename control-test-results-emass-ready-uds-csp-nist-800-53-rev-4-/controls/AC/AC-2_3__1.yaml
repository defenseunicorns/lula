  Description:

  The information system automatically disables inactive accounts after
  [Assignment: organization-defined time period].


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; security plan; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system-generated list of temporary accounts removed and/or
  disabled; information system-generated list of emergency accounts removed
  and/or disabled; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing account management
  functions].

  000017: The information system automatically disables inactive accounts after
  an organization-defined time period.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  disable inactive accounts after 35 days. For information system components
  that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed
  must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 000017. DoD has
  defined the time period as 35 days.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Access control policy which defines the process for disabling inactive
  accounts after 35 days.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to disable inactive accounts after 35 days. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization
  conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that
  the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the information
  system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI
  000017. DoD has defined the time period as 35 days.

test-results: "Not Applicable to tech stack. (This control calls for automatically disabling inactive accounts after an organization-defined time. Out-of-the-box, Keycloak does not automatically lock or remove user accounts purely due to inactivity over a long period. Administrators would have to periodically review login activity (which Keycloak records per user) and manually disable accounts that haven't been used within the threshold. Itâ\x80\x99s possible to extend Keycloak or use scripts to implement this (e.g., a scheduled job that queries for users who haven't logged in within 60 days and disables them), but UDS doesnâ\x80\x99t include that automation by default. Thus, while the data is available (last login timestamps, etc., are accessible and could be acted on), UDS only partially meets this control: inactive account disabling must be handled via administrative process or additional tooling.)"
