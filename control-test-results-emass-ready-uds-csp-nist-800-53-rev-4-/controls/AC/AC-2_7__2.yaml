  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Establishes and administers privileged user accounts in accordance with a
  role-based access scheme that organizes allowed information system access and
  privileges into roles;

  (b) Monitors privileged role assignments; and

  (c) Takes [Assignment: organization-defined actions] when privileged role
  assignments are no longer appropriate.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals that
  allow those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that
  ordinary users are not authorized to perform. These privileged roles include,
  for example, key management, account management, network and system
  administration, database administration, and web administration.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; information
  system-generated list of privileged user accounts and associated role; records
  of actions taken when privileged role assignments are no longer appropriate;
  information system audit records; audit tracking and monitoring reports;
  information system monitoring records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing account management
  functions; automated mechanisms monitoring privileged role assignments].

  with a role-based access scheme that organizes allowed information system
  access and privileges into roles.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to administer privileged user accounts in accordance with a role-based access
  scheme that organizes allowed information system access and privileges into
  roles.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation that lists the procedures and requirements
  for getting a privileged user account.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines
  documented processes for privileged user account creation to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed administers privileged user accounts in
  accordance with a role-based access scheme that organizes allowed information
  system access and privileges into roles.

  UDS natively implements RBAC at multiple layers: Kubernetes RBAC enforces
  least privilege on cluster operations, and Keycloak provides role-based
  authorization for applications. The system is designed such that permissions
  are grouped into roles and then roles are assigned to accounts which a direct
  correspondence to RBAC. For example, within Kubernetes, service accounts or
  users are bound to roles (which have specific permissions like read-only,
  deploy pods, etc.), and by default only minimal permissions are given unless
  elevated by an admin. Keycloak similarly allows definition of fine-grained
  roles for application access.
