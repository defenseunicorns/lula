  Description:

  The organization [Selection: restricts; prohibits] the use of
  non-organizationally owned information systems, system components, or devices
  to process, store, or transmit organizational information.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Non-organizationally owned devices include devices owned by other
  organizations (e.g., federal/state agencies, contractors) and personally owned
  devices. There are risks to using non-organizationally owned devices. In some
  cases, the risk is sufficiently high as to prohibit such use. In other cases,
  it may be such that the use of non-organizationally owned devices is allowed
  but restricted in some way. Restrictions include, for example: (i) requiring
  the implementation of organization-approved security controls prior to
  authorizing such connections; (ii) limiting access to certain types of
  information, services, or applications; (iii) using virtualization techniques
  to limit processing and storage activities to servers or other system
  components provisioned by the organization; and (iv) agreeing to terms and
  conditions for usage. For personally owned devices, organizations consult with
  the Office of the General Counsel regarding legal issues associated with using
  such devices in operational environments, including, for example, requirements
  for conducting forensic analyses during investigations after an incident.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing the use of
  external information systems; security plan; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system connection or processing agreements; account
  management documents; information system audit records, other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  restricting or prohibiting use of non-organizationally owned information
  systems, system components, or devices; system/network administrators;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing restrictions on the use
  of non-organizationally owned systems/components/devices].

  002338: The organization restricts or prohibits the use of
  non-organizationally owned information systems, system components, or devices
  to process, store, or transmit organizational information.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to restrict or prohibit the use of non-organizationally owned information
  systems, system components, or devices to process, store, or transmit
  organizational information.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan (SSP)

  2.) Signed and dated MOU/MOA with any external information systems that
  describes the process that restricts or prohibits the use of
  non-organizationally owned information systems, system components, or devices
  to process, store, or transmit organizational information.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented process to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  restricts or prohibits the use of non-organizationally owned information
  systems, system components, or devices to process, store, or transmit
  organizational information.

test-results: "Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Any restrictions on using UDS from personal or external devices, or terms of use for external system connections, must be handled by policy. UDS does not inherently enforce device-specific rules beyond standard network access control. The expectation is that the hosting environment√¢\x80\x99s policies prevent unauthorized external system use.)"
