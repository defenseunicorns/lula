  Description:

  The organization establishes terms and conditions, consistent with any trust
  relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or
  maintaining external information systems, allowing authorized individuals to

  a. Access the information system from external information systems; and

  b. Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using
  external information systems.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  External information systems are information systems or components of
  information systems that are outside of the authorization boundary established
  by organizations and for which organizations typically have no direct
  supervision and authority over the application of required security controls
  or the assessment of control effectiveness. External information systems
  include, for example: (i) personally owned information systems/devices (e.g.,
  notebook computers, smart phones, tablets, personal digital assistants); (ii)
  privately owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or
  public facilities (e.g., hotels, train stations, convention centers, shopping
  malls, or airports); (iii) information systems owned or controlled by
  nonfederal governmental organizations; and (iv) federal information systems
  that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and
  authority of organizations. This control also addresses the use of external
  information systems for the processing, storage, or transmission of
  organizational information, including, for example, accessing cloud services
  (e.g., infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, or software as a
  service) from organizational information systems.

  For some external information systems (i.e., information systems operated by
  other federal agencies, including organizations subordinate to those
  agencies), the trust relationships that have been established between those
  organizations and the originating organization may be such, that no explicit
  terms and conditions are required. Information systems within these
  organizations would not be considered external. These situations occur when,
  for example, there are pre-existing sharing/trust agreements (either implicit
  or explicit) established between federal agencies or organizations subordinate
  to those agencies, or when such trust agreements are specified by applicable
  laws, Executive Orders, directives, or policies. Authorized individuals
  include, for example, organizational personnel, contractors, or other
  individuals with authorized access to organizational information systems and
  over which organizations have the authority to impose rules of behavior with
  regard to system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized
  individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions may vary depending upon
  the trust relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may
  choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors than on state,
  local, or tribal governments.

  This control does not apply to the use of external information systems to
  access public interfaces to organizational information systems (e.g.,
  individuals accessing federal information through www.usa.gov). Organizations
  establish terms and conditions for the use of external information systems in
  accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and
  conditions address as a minimum: types of applications that can be accessed on
  organizational information systems from external information systems; and the
  highest security category of information that can be processed, stored, or
  transmitted on external information systems. If terms and conditions with the
  owners of external information systems cannot be established, organizations
  may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external
  systems. Related controls: AC-3, AC-17, AC-19, CA-3, PL-4, SA-9.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing the use of
  external information systems; external information systems terms and
  conditions; list of types of applications accessible from external information
  systems; maximum security categorization for information processed, stored, or
  transmitted on external information systems; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  defining terms and conditions for use of external information systems to
  access organizational systems; system/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing terms and conditions on
  use of external information systems].

  trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating,

  The organization being inspected/assessed establishes and documents terms and
  conditions, consistent with any trust relationships established with other
  organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external information
  systems, allowing authorized individuals to access the information system from
  the external information systems.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated MOU/MOA with any external information systems
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented terms and conditions to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed establishes terms and conditions, consistent with any trust
  relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or
  maintaining external information systems, allowing authorized individuals to
  access the information system from the external information systems.

  to the organizational requirements and is handled outside of the system though
  technical access can be enforced by UDS.)
