control-acronym: AC-4(4)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system prevents encrypted information from bypassing
  content-checking mechanisms by [Selection (one or more): decrypting the
  information; blocking the flow of the encrypted information; terminating
  communications sessions attempting to pass encrypted information; [Assignment:
  organization-defined procedure or method]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related control: SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; information flow control
  policies; procedures addressing information flow enforcement; information
  system design documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing information flow
  enforcement policy].

  002193: The organization defines procedures or methods to be employed by the
  information system to prevent encrypted information from bypassing
  content-checking mechanisms, such as decrypting the information, blocking the
  flow of the encrypted information, and/or terminating communications sessions
  attempting to pass encrypted information.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed selects or defines, and documents
  the mechanism to prevent encrypted information from bypassing content-checking
  mechanisms, such as decrypting the information, blocking the flow of the
  encrypted information, and/or terminating communications sessions attempting
  to pass encrypted information. Alternatively, the organization may define
  their own procedure or method. DoD has determined the procedures or methods
  are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation that defines the procedures or methods used
  to prevent encrypted information from bypassing content-checking mechanisms.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented mechanism to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  selects or defines the mechanism to prevent encrypted information from
  bypassing content-checking mechanisms. DoD has determined the procedures or
  methods are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
