  Description:

  The organization disables accounts of users posing a significant risk within
  [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of discovery of the risk.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Users posing a significant risk to organizations include individuals for whom
  reliable evidence or intelligence indicates either the intention to use
  authorized access to information systems to cause harm or through whom
  adversaries will cause harm. Harm includes potential adverse impacts to
  organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the
  Nation. Close coordination between authorizing officials, information system
  administrators, and human resource managers is essential in order for timely
  execution of this control enhancement. Related control: PS-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system-generated list of
  disabled accounts; list of user activities posing significant organizational
  risk; information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing account management
  functions].
