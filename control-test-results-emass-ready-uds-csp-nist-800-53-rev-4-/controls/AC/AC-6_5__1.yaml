  Description:

  The organization restricts privileged accounts on the information system to
  [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically described as
  system administrator for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating
  systems. Restricting privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles
  prevents day-to-day users from having access to privileged
  information/functions. Organizations may differentiate in the application of
  this control enhancement between allowed privileges for local accounts and for
  domain accounts provided organizations retain the ability to control
  information system configurations for key security parameters and as otherwise
  necessary to sufficiently mitigate risk. Related control: CM-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing least
  privilege; list of system-generated privileged accounts; list of system
  administration personnel; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  defining least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing least privilege
  functions].

  002226: The organization defines the personnel or roles to whom privileged
  accounts are to be restricted on the information system.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the personnel
  or roles to whom privileged accounts are to be restricted on the information
  system. DoD has determined the personnel and roles are not appropriate to
  define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated access control policy

  2.) Signed and dated system security plan (SSP)

  3.) Copy of privileged user agreement

  4.) Signed and dated documentation that defines the personnel or roles to whom
  privileged accounts are to be restricted on the information system.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented personnel or roles to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed defines the personnel or roles to whom privileged accounts
  are to be restricted on the information system. DoD has determined the
  personnel and roles are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Not applicable to the UDS technology stack. (UDS platform provides robust
  technical capabilities to restrict privileged accounts through its centralized
  identity management solution (Keycloak) and Kubernetes Role-Based Access
  Control (RBAC). Privileged roles such as system administrators, security
  managers, or auditors can be explicitly defined and assigned granular
  permissions within Keycloak and Kubernetes, ensuring privileged access is
  strictly controlled. However, explicitly defining and documenting the specific
  personnel or organizational roles authorized to receive privileged accounts
  remains an organizational responsibility. While UDS fully supports enforcing
  privileged access restrictions, the organization deploying UDS must formally
  document and approve the assignment of privileged roles and accounts within
  internal security policies )
