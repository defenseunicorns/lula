control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization permits authorized individuals to use an external information
  system to access the information system or to process, store, or transmit
  organization-controlled information only when the organization

  (a) Verifies the implementation of required security controls on the external
  system as specified in the organization's information security policy and
  security plan; or

  (b) Retains approved information system connection or processing agreements
  with the organizational entity hosting the external information system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement recognizes that there are circumstances where
  individuals using external information systems (e.g., contractors, coalition
  partners) need to access organizational information systems. In those
  situations, organizations need confidence that the external information
  systems contain the necessary security safeguards (i.e., security controls),
  so as not to compromise, damage, or otherwise harm organizational information
  systems. Verification that the required security controls have been
  implemented can be achieved, for example, by third-party, independent
  assessments, attestations, or other means, depending on the confidence level
  required by organizations. Related control: CA-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing the use of
  external information systems; security plan; information system connection or
  processing agreements; account management documents; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing limits on use of
  external information systems].

  to the organizational requirements and is handled outside of the system though
  technical access can be enforced by UDS.)
