control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization provides the capability to expeditiously disconnect or
  disable remote access to the information system within [Assignment:
  organization-defined time period].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement requires organizations to have the capability to
  rapidly disconnect current users remotely accessing the information system
  and/or disable further remote access. The speed of disconnect or disablement
  varies based on the criticality of missions/business functions and the need to
  eliminate immediate or future remote access to organizational information
  systems.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing
  disconnecting or disabling remote access to the information system;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; security plan, information system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing capability to disconnect
  or disable remote access to information system].

  002322: The organization provides the capability to expeditiously disconnect
  or disable remote access to the information system within the
  organization-defined time period.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  provide the capability to expeditiously disconnect or disable remote access to
  the information system immediately. For information system components that
  have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 2322. DoD has defined
  the time period as immediately.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks

  2.) Documentation that shows the information system is configured to provide
  the capability to expeditiously disconnect or disable remote access to the
  information system immediately
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to provide the capability to expeditiously disconnect or
  disable remote access to the information system immediately. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization
  conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that
  the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the information
  system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI
  2322. DoD has defined the time period as immediately.
