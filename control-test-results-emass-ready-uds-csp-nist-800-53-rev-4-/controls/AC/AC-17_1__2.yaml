control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system monitors and controls remote access methods.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Automated monitoring and control of remote access sessions allows
  organizations to detect cyber attacks and also ensure ongoing compliance with
  remote access policies by auditing connection activities of remote users on a
  variety of information system components (e.g., servers, workstations,
  notebook computers, smart phones, and tablets). Related controls: AU-2, AU-12.


  Added by [r4] Privacy (Confidentiality Impact Level: Moderate) Overlay: Audit
  all remote access to, and actions on, resources containing PII. Related
  Control: AU-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing remote
  access to the information system; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; information system monitoring records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms monitoring and controlling remote
  access methods].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] Privacy (Confidentiality Impact Level: Moderate) Overlay:
  Auditing remote access ensures unauthorized connections to information systems
  containing PII can be detected across all information system platforms (e.g.,
  servers, mobile devices, work stations).

cci-definition: '002314: The information system controls remote access methods.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  control remote access methods. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 2314.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Log files that record remote access and blocks

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to control remote access methods. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 2314.
