control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined data mining
  prevention and detection techniques] for [Assignment: organization-defined
  data storage objects] to adequately detect and protect against data mining.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Data storage objects include, for example, databases, database records, and
  database fields. Data mining prevention and detection techniques include, for
  example: (i) limiting the types of responses provided to database queries;
  (ii) limiting the number/frequency of database queries to increase the work
  factor needed to determine the contents of such databases; and (iii) notifying
  organizational personnel when atypical database queries or accesses occur.
  This control focuses on the protection of organizational information from data
  mining while such information resides in organizational data stores. In
  contrast, AU-13 focuses on monitoring for organizational information that may
  have been mined or otherwise obtained from data stores and is now available as
  open source information residing on external sites, for example, through
  social networking or social media websites.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing data
  mining techniques; procedures addressing protection of data storage objects
  against data mining; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; information system
  audit logs; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  implementing data mining detection and prevention techniques for data storage
  objects; organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing data mining prevention
  and detection].

  002345: The organization defines the data storage objects that are to be
  protected against data mining attempts.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the data
  storage objects that are to be protected against data mining attempts. DoD has
  determined the data storage objects are not appropriate to define at the
  Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan (SSP)/standard operating procedure
  (SOP) or concept of operations (CONOP) that defines and describes the data
  storage objects that are to be protected against data mining attempts.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented data storage objects to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed defines the data storage objects that are to be protected
  against data mining attempts. DoD has determined the data storage objects are
  not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Though UDS provided robust monitoring
  capabilities it does not provide specific data mining prevention.)
