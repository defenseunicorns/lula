control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization allows personnel to associate, and maintain the association
  of [Assignment: organization-defined security attributes] with [Assignment:
  organization-defined subjects and objects] in accordance with [Assignment:
  organization-defined security policies].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement requires individual users (as opposed to the
  information system) to maintain associations of security attributes with
  subjects and objects.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing
  association of security attributes with subjects and objects; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  associating and maintaining association of security attributes with subjects
  and objects; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting associations of security
  attributes to subjects and objects].

  002294: The organization defines the objects to be associated, and that
  association maintained, with organization-defined security attributes in
  accordance with organization-defined security policies.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the objects to
  be associated, and that association maintained, with organization-defined
  security attributes in accordance with organization-defined security policies.
  DoD has determined the objects are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise
  level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation that defines objects and associates them
  with organization-defined security attributes in accordance with
  organization-defined security policies.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented objects to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed defines
  the objects to be associated, and that association maintained, with
  organization-defined security attributes in accordance with
  organization-defined security policies. DoD has determined the objects are not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS enables dynamic association and
  enforcement of organizationally defined security attributes (e.g., sensitivity
  levels, classification labels, and handling instructions) with subjects and
  objects. However, explicitly defining, documenting, and enforcing the specific
  security policies that personnel must follow when assigning and managing these
  attributes remains an organizational administrative responsibility.)
