family: AC
control-acronym: AC-23
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined data mining
  prevention and detection techniques] for [Assignment: organization-defined
  data storage objects] to adequately detect and protect against data mining.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Data storage objects include, for example, databases, database records, and
  database fields. Data mining prevention and detection techniques include, for
  example: (i) limiting the types of responses provided to database queries;
  (ii) limiting the number/frequency of database queries to increase the work
  factor needed to determine the contents of such databases; and (iii) notifying
  organizational personnel when atypical database queries or accesses occur.
  This control focuses on the protection of organizational information from data
  mining while such information resides in organizational data stores. In
  contrast, AU-13 focuses on monitoring for organizational information that may
  have been mined or otherwise obtained from data stores and is now available as
  open source information residing on external sites, for example, through
  social networking or social media websites.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing data
  mining techniques; procedures addressing protection of data storage objects
  against data mining; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; information system
  audit logs; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  implementing data mining detection and prevention techniques for data storage
  objects; organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing data mining prevention
  and detection].

  002346: Employs organization-defined data mining prevention techniques for
  organization-defined data storage objects to protect against unauthorized data
  mining.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  employ data mining prevention techniques defined in AC-23, CCI 2343 for data
  storage objects defined in AC-23, CCI 2345 to adequately detect data mining
  attempts. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG
  guidance that pertains to CCI 2346.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks

  2.) Documentation that shows the information system is configured to employ
  data mining prevention techniques defined in AC-23, CCI 2343 for data storage
  objects defined in AC-23, CCI 2345 to adequately detect data mining attempts.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to employ data mining prevention techniques defined in
  AC-23, CCI 2343 for data storage objects defined in AC-23, CCI 2345 to
  adequately detect data mining attempts. For information system components that
  have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 2346.
