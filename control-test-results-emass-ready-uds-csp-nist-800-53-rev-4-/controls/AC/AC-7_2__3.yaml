family: AC
control-acronym: AC-7(2)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system purges/wipes information from [Assignment:
  organization-defined mobile devices] based on [Assignment:
  organization-defined purging/wiping requirements/techniques] after
  [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive, unsuccessful device
  logon attempts.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement applies only to mobile devices for which a logon
  occurs (e.g., personal digital assistants, smart phones, tablets). The logon
  is to the mobile device, not to any one account on the device. Therefore,
  successful logons to any accounts on mobile devices reset the unsuccessful
  logon count to zero. Organizations define information to be purged/wiped
  carefully in order to avoid over purging/wiping which may result in devices
  becoming unusable. Purging/wiping may be unnecessary if the information on the
  device is protected with sufficiently strong encryption mechanisms. Related
  controls: AC-19, MP-5, MP-6, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing
  unsuccessful login attempts on mobile devices; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; list of mobile devices to be purged/wiped after
  organization-defined consecutive, unsuccessful device logon attempts; list of
  purging/wiping requirements or techniques for mobile devices; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing access control policy
  for unsuccessful device logon attempts].

  device logon attempts after which the information system will purge/wipe
  organization-defined mobile devices.

  The organization being inspected/assessed is automatically compliant with this
  CCI because they are covered at the DoD level. DoD has defined the number as
  10.
