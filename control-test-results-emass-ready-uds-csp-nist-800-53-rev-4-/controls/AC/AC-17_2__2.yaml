  Description:

  The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect the
  confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The encryption strength of mechanism is selected based on the security
  categorization of the information. Related controls: SC-8, SC-12, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing remote
  access to the information system; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  cryptographic mechanisms and associated configuration documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Cryptographic mechanisms protecting confidentiality and
  integrity of remote access sessions].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] Privacy (Confidentiality Impact Level: Moderate) Overlay:
  Encrypting remote sessions protects the confidentiality and integrity of PII.

  001453: The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect
  the integrity of remote access sessions.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of remote access
  sessions. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG
  guidance that pertains to CCI 1453.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect the
  integrity of remote access sessions. For information system components that
  have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 1453.
