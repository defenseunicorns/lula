  Description:

  The organization

  a. Establishes usage restrictions, configuration requirements, connection
  requirements, and implementation guidance for organization-controlled mobile
  devices; and

  b. Authorizes the connection of mobile devices to organizational information
  systems.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A mobile device is a computing device that: (i) has a small form factor such
  that it can easily be carried by a single individual; (ii) is designed to
  operate without a physical connection (e.g., wirelessly transmit or receive
  information); (iii) possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage;
  and (iv) includes a self-contained power source. Mobile devices may also
  include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the
  device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing
  local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones, E-readers,
  and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual
  and the device is usually in close proximity to the individual; however, the
  degree of proximity can vary depending upon on the form factor and size of the
  device. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile
  device may be comparable to or merely a subset of desktop systems, depending
  upon the nature and intended purpose of the device. Due to the large variety
  of mobile devices with different technical characteristics and capabilities,
  organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes/types of such
  devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile
  devices include, for example, configuration management, device identification
  and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software (e.g.,
  malicious code detection, firewall), scanning devices for malicious code,
  updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and
  patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident
  software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware (e.g.,
  wireless, infrared). Organizations are cautioned that the need to provide
  adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements in this
  control. Many safeguards and countermeasures for mobile devices are reflected
  in other security controls in the catalog allocated in the initial control
  baselines as starting points for the development of security plans and
  overlays using the tailoring process. There may also be some degree of overlap
  in the requirements articulated by the security controls within the different
  families of controls. AC-20 addresses mobile devices that are not
  organization-controlled. Related controls: AC-3, AC-7, AC-18, AC-20, CA-9,
  CM-2, IA-2, IA-3, MP-2, MP-4, MP-5, PL-4, SC-7, SC-43, SI-3, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing access
  control for mobile device usage (including restrictions); configuration
  management plan; security plan; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  authorizations for mobile device connections to organizational information
  systems; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel using mobile devices to
  access organizational information systems; system/network administrators;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Access control capability authorizing mobile device
  connections to organizational information systems].
