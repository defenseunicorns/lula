  Description:

  The information system protects wireless access to the system using
  authentication of [Selection (one or more): users; devices] and encryption.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related controls: SC-8, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing wireless
  implementation and usage (including restrictions); information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing wireless access
  protections to the information system].

  001443: The information system protects wireless access to the system using
  authentication of users and/or devices.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  protect wireless access to the system using authentication of users and/or
  devices. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs,
  the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG
  guidance that pertains to CCI 1443.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan (SSP)

  2.) Signed and dated wireless access policy
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to protect wireless access to the system using
  authentication of users and/or devices. For information system components that
  have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 1443.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS does not inherently control the
  use of wireless networking. Any wireless access control would be handled by
  the underlying network infrastructure, not by UDS itself i.e. wireless network
  adapters and bluetooth would be enabled/disabled at the operating system.)
