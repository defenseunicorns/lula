  Description:

  The information system automatically [Selection: removes; disables] temporary
  and emergency accounts after [Assignment: organization-defined time period for
  each type of account].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement requires the removal of both temporary and emergency
  accounts automatically after a predefined period of time has elapsed, rather
  than at the convenience of the systems administrator.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; security plan; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system-generated list of temporary accounts removed and/or
  disabled; information system-generated list of emergency accounts removed
  and/or disabled; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing account management
  functions].

  000016: The information system automatically removes or disables temporary
  accounts after an organization-defined time period for each type of account.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  automatically remove or disable temporary accounts after 72 hours. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 000016. DoD has defined the time period as 72 hours.
  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation which defines how temporary accounts are
  automatically removed or disabled after a 72 hour period.

  2.) Applicable STIG checks.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to automatically remove or disable temporary accounts after
  72 hours. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the
  components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 000016. DoD has defined the time period as 72 hours.

test-results: >-
  This enhancement requires automatically disabling or removing temporary or
  emergency accounts after a defined period. The UDS stack allows creation of
  temporary accounts (e.g., a Keycloak user account for a guest or emergency
  access) and those accounts can be given an expiration date by an admin which
  then mark them disabled. This can be done in Keycloak by creating a custom
  attribute with the 72 hour expiration value or done via the Keycloak Admin API
  using a JSON file that contains the custom attribute. Following security best
  practices it is typically not recommended to use temporary accounts.
