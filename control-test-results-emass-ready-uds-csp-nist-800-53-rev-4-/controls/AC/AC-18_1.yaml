family: AC
control-acronym: AC-18
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization

  a. Establishes usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and
  implementation guidance for wireless access; and

  b. Authorizes wireless access to the information system prior to allowing such
  connections.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Wireless technologies include, for example, microwave, packet radio (UHF/VHF),
  802.11x, and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication protocols (e.g.,
  EAP/TLS, PEAP), which provide credential protection and mutual authentication.
  Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-17, AC-19, CA-3, CA-7, CM-8, IA-2, IA-3,
  IA-8, PL-4, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing wireless
  access implementation and usage (including restrictions); configuration
  management plan; security plan; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  wireless access authorizations; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  managing wireless access connections; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Wireless access management capability for the information
  system].
