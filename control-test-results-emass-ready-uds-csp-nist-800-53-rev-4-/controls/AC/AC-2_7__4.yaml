  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Establishes and administers privileged user accounts in accordance with a
  role-based access scheme that organizes allowed information system access and
  privileges into roles;

  (b) Monitors privileged role assignments; and

  (c) Takes [Assignment: organization-defined actions] when privileged role
  assignments are no longer appropriate.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals that
  allow those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that
  ordinary users are not authorized to perform. These privileged roles include,
  for example, key management, account management, network and system
  administration, database administration, and web administration.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; information
  system-generated list of privileged user accounts and associated role; records
  of actions taken when privileged role assignments are no longer appropriate;
  information system audit records; audit tracking and monitoring reports;
  information system monitoring records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing account management
  functions; automated mechanisms monitoring privileged role assignments].

  DoD has defined the actions as disables (or revokes) privileged user account.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:
  Automatically compliant
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed is automatically compliant with this
  CCI because they are covered at the DoD level. DoD has defined the actions as
  disables (or revokes) privileged user account.
