control-acronym: AC-17(3)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system routes all remote accesses through [Assignment:
  organization-defined number] managed network access control points.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Limiting the number of access control points for remote accesses reduces the
  attack surface for organizations. Organizations consider the Trusted Internet
  Connections (TIC) initiative requirements for external network connections.
  Related control: SC-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing remote
  access to the information system; information system design documentation;
  list of all managed network access control points; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; information system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms routing all remote accesses through
  managed network access control points].

  002315: The organization defines the number of managed network access control
  points through which the information system routes all remote access.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the number of
  managed network access control points through which the information system
  routes all remote access. DoD has determined the number is not appropriate to
  define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation (ex. network flow chart, network diagram,
  hardware inventory sheet and/or other document that will list all remote
  access points) that defines the number of managed network access control
  points through which the information system routes all remote access.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented number to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed defines
  the number of managed network access control points through which the
  information system routes all remote access. DoD has determined the number is
  not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
