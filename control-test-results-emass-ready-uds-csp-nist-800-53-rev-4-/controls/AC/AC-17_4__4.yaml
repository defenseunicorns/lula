control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Authorizes the execution of privileged commands and access to
  security-relevant information via remote access only for [Assignment:
  organization-defined needs]; and

  (b) Documents the rationale for such access in the security plan for the
  information system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related control: AC-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing remote
  access to the information system; information system configuration settings
  and associated documentation; security plan; information system audit records;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing remote access
  management].

  002318: The organization defines the operational needs when access to
  security-relevant information via remote access is to be authorized.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the
  operational needs when access to security-relevant information via remote
  access is to be authorized. DoD has determined the operational needs are not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated access control policy, which defines the operational
  needs when access to security-relevant information via remote access is to be
  authorized.

  2.) Signed and dated system security plan (SSP)

  3.) Signed and dated privileged user agreement
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented operational needs to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed defines the operational needs when access to
  security-relevant information via remote access is to be authorized. DoD has
  determined the operational needs are not appropriate to define at the
  Enterprise level.
