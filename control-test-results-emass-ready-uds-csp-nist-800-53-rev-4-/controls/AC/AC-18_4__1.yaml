  Description:

  The organization identifies and explicitly authorizes users allowed to
  independently configure wireless networking capabilities.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizational authorizations to allow selected users to configure wireless
  networking capability are enforced in part, by the access enforcement
  mechanisms employed within organizational information systems. Related
  controls: AC-3, SC-15.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing wireless
  implementation and usage (including restrictions); information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms authorizing independent user
  configuration of wireless networking capabilities].

  configure wireless networking capabilities.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed identifies and explicitly authorizes
  users allowed to independently configure wireless networking capabilities. The
  organization must maintain an audit trail of authorizations.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated access control policy and/or account maintenance policy.

  2.) Audit trail of authorizations that shows that the site identifies and
  explicitly authorizes users (names and titles) allowed to independently
  configure wireless networking capabilities.

  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  audit trail of authorizations to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed identifies and explicitly authorizes users allowed to
  independently configure wireless networking capabilities.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS does not inherently control the
  use of wireless networking. Any wireless access control would be handled by
  the underlying network infrastructure, not by UDS itself i.e. wireless network
  adapters and bluetooth would be enabled/disabled at the operating system.)
