control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system enforces approved authorizations for logical access to
  information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control
  policies.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies,
  attribute-based policies) and access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access
  control lists, access control matrices, cryptography) control access between
  active entities or subjects (i.e., users or processes acting on behalf of
  users) and passive entities or objects (e.g., devices, files, records,
  domains) in information systems. In addition to enforcing authorized access at
  the information system level and recognizing that information systems can host
  many applications and services in support of organizational missions and
  business operations, access enforcement mechanisms can also be employed at the
  application and service level to provide increased information security.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing access
  enforcement; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; list of approved
  authorizations (user privileges); information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with access enforcement
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing access control policy].

  000213: The information system enforces approved authorizations for logical
  access to information and system resources in accordance with applicable
  access control policies.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  enforce approved authorizations for logical access to information and system
  resources in accordance with applicable access control policies. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 213.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Access control policy.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to enforce approved authorizations for logical access to
  information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control
  policies. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the
  components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 213.

test-results: "UDS enforces access control for systems and services through multiple layers. At the application level, Keycloak ensures that only authenticated and authorized users can access protected applications (via OAuth2/OIDC tokens or SSO sessions). At the service/microservice level, AuthService (integrated with Istio창\x80\x99s Envoy sidecars) acts as a policy enforcement point to check user tokens and permissions before allowing API requests, ensuring that application-level access policies are uniformly enforced. Additionally, Kubernetes RBAC ensures that administrative operations (like deploying a container or accessing a config) are only executed by principals with the correct role. In effect, every request in the UDS environment whether a user logging into a web app or a service calling another service 창\x80\x93 goes through an access control check: user requests are vetted by Keycloak/AuthService, and inter-service calls are controlled by Istio창\x80\x99s security policies. These mechanisms collectively satisfy the control창\x80\x99s intent by enforcing assigned access privileges on all attempted actions in the system."
