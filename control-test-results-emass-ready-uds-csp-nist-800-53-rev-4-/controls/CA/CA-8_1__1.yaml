  Description:

  The organization employs an independent penetration agent or penetration team
  to perform penetration testing on the information system or system components.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Independent penetration agents or teams are individuals or groups who conduct
  impartial penetration testing of organizational information systems.
  Impartiality implies that penetration agents or teams are free from any
  perceived or actual conflicts of interest with regard to the development,
  operation, or management of the information systems that are the targets of
  the penetration testing. Supplemental guidance for CA-2 (1) provides
  additional information regarding independent assessments that can be applied
  to penetration testing. Related control: CA-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed employs an independent penetration
  agent or penetration team to perform penetration testing on the information
  system or system components. The organization must maintain a record of
  penetration test results.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) SOP/TTP documenting the employment of an independent penetration agent or
  penetration team to perform penetration testing on information systems or
  system components.

  2.) Penetration testing results
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines a
  sampling of the penetration test results to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed employs an independent penetration agent or penetration
  team to perform penetration testing on the information system or system
  components.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The UDS technology stack does not
  conduct penetration testing or provide tools specifically for penetration
  testing. The responsibility for defining the frequency and conducting
  penetration testing on organization-defined information systems or system
  components lies with the organization. The organization must define and
  document the frequency for conducting penetration testing in accordance with
  their organizational requirements. This includes maintaining a record of
  penetration test results and ensuring that testing is conducted at the defined
  intervals.)
