  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Authorizes internal connections of [Assignment: organization-defined
  information system components or classes of components] to the information
  system; and

  b. Documents, for each internal connection, the interface characteristics,
  security requirements, and the nature of the information communicated.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies to connections between organizational information systems
  and (separate) constituent system components (i.e., intra-system connections)
  including, for example, system connections with mobile devices,
  notebook/desktop computers, printers, copiers, facsimile machines, scanners,
  sensors, and servers. Instead of authorizing each individual internal
  connection, organizations can authorize internal connections for a class of
  components with common characteristics and/or configurations, for example, all
  digital printers, scanners, and copiers with a specified processing, storage,
  and transmission capability or all smart phones with a specific baseline
  configuration. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, AC-18, AC-19, AU-2, AU-12, CA-7,
  CM-2, IA-3, SC-7, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing
  information system connections; system and communications protection policy;
  security plan; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; list of components or
  classes of components authorized as internal system connections; security
  assessment report; information system audit records; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  developing, implementing, or authorizing internal system connections;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].

  002101: The organization authorizes internal connections of
  organization-defined information system components or classes of components to
  the information system.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed authorizes internal connections of
  information system components defined in CA-9, CCI 2102 or classes of
  components to the information system. The organization must maintain an audit
  trail of authorizations.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Audit trail of documentation of authorizations of internal connections of
  information system components defined in CA-9, CCI 2102 or classes of
  components to the information system.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  audit trail of authorizations to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed authorizes internal connections of information system
  components defined in CA-9, CCI 2102 or classes of components to the
  information system.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The organization is responsible for
  authorizing new or existing internal connections per their organization
  authorizing workflow. UDS provides robust technical capabilities to control
  and authorize internal connections between information system components
  through infrastructure management and security solutions. Specifically, UDS
  utilizes Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via OpenTofu, network policy enforcement
  with Istio Service Mesh, and security policies implemented by the policy
  engine Pepr to explicitly authorize and control connections between internal
  system components, ensuring only approved communications occur within the
  system boundary.)
