  Description:

  The organization prohibits the direct connection of an [Assignment:
  organization-defined information system] to a public network.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A public network is any network accessible to the general public including,
  for example, the Internet and organizational extranets with public access.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing
  information system connections; system and communications protection policy;
  information system interconnection security agreements; security plan;
  information system design documentation; ; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; security assessment report; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting the management of public
  network connections].

  002078: The organization prohibits the direct connection of an
  organization-defined information system to a public network.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed does not connect any information
  system defined in CA-3 (4), CCI 2079 to a public network.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Network topology diagram
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines
  network topology diagrams and examines the information system to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed does not connect any information system
  defined in CA-3 (4), CCI 2079 to a public network.

test-results: "Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS can enforce technical controls on external system connections (as discussed in AC-20) â\x80\x93 for example, only allowing connections to approved external services and using secure protocols. If UDS needs to connect with another system (like a data feed or identity service), those connections can be governed by configuration and monitored.. However, the requirement to obtain formal authorization for interconnection is an organizational responsibility. The stack itself cannot grant or record â\x80\x9Cinterconnection agreements;â\x80\x9D it can only enforce security on the connection.)"
