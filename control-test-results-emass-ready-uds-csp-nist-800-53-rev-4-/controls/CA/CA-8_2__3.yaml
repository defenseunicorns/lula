  Description:

  The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined red team exercises]
  to simulate attempts by adversaries to compromise organizational information
  systems in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined rules of
  engagement].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Red team exercises extend the objectives of penetration testing by examining
  the security posture of organizations and their ability to implement effective
  cyber defenses. As such, red team exercises reflect simulated adversarial
  attempts to compromise organizational mission/business functions and provide a
  comprehensive assessment of the security state of information systems and
  organizations. Simulated adversarial attempts to compromise organizational
  missions/business functions and the information systems that support those
  missions/functions may include technology-focused attacks (e.g., interactions
  with hardware, software, or firmware components and/or mission/business
  processes) and social engineering-based attacks (e.g., interactions via email,
  telephone, shoulder surfing, or personal conversations). While penetration
  testing may be largely laboratory-based testing, organizations use red team
  exercises to provide more comprehensive assessments that reflect real-world
  conditions. Red team exercises can be used to improve security awareness and
  training and to assess levels of security control effectiveness.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  002099: The organization employs organization-defined red team exercises to
  simulate attempts by adversaries to compromise organizational information
  systems in accordance with organization-defined rules of engagement.
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed employs red team exercises defined
  in CA-8 (2), CCI 2097 to simulate attempts by adversaries to compromise
  organizational information systems in accordance with rules of engagement
  defined in CA-8 (2), CCI 2098. The organization must maintain a record of red
  team exercises and results.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Record of Red Team exercises

  2.) Results of the Red Team exercise as defined in CA 8 (2), CCI 2097 to
  simulate attempts by adversaries to compromise organizational information
  systems IAW the rules of engagement defined in CA-8 (2), CCI 2098.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  record of red team exercises and results to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed employs red team exercises defined in CA-8 (2), CCI 2097 to
  simulate attempts by adversaries to compromise organizational information
  systems in accordance with rules of engagement defined in CA-8 (2), CCI 2098.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The UDS technology stack does not
  conduct penetration testing or provide tools specifically for penetration
  testing. The responsibility for defining the frequency and conducting
  penetration testing on organization-defined information systems or system
  components lies with the organization. The organization must define and
  document the frequency for conducting penetration testing in accordance with
  their organizational requirements. This includes maintaining a record of
  penetration test results and ensuring that testing is conducted at the defined
  intervals.)
