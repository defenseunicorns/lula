  Description:

  The organization prohibits the direct connection of a classified, national
  security system to an external network without the use of [Assignment:
  organization-defined boundary protection device].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations typically do not have control over external networks (e.g., the
  Internet). Approved boundary protection devices (e.g., routers, firewalls)
  mediate communications (i.e., information flows) between classified national
  security systems and external networks. In addition, approved boundary
  protection devices (typically managed interface/cross-domain systems) provide
  information flow enforcement from information systems to external networks.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing
  information system connections; system and communications protection policy;
  information system interconnection security agreements; security plan;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; security assessment report; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  managing direct connections to external networks; network administrators;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities; personnel
  managing directly connected external networks].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting the management of external
  network connections].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed does not connect any national
  security systems to an external network without the use of protection devices
  defined in CA-3 (2), CCI 2074.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Security Assessment Plan or Interconnection Security
  Agreement documenting that boundary protection is used to connect to
  organization-defined classified and NSS to an external network.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines
  network topology diagrams and examines the information system to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed does not connect any national security
  systems to an external network without the use of protection devices defined
  in CA-3 (2), CCI 2074.

test-results: "Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS can enforce technical controls on external system connections (as discussed in AC-20) â\x80\x93 for example, only allowing connections to approved external services and using secure protocols. If UDS needs to connect with another system (like a data feed or identity service), those connections can be governed by configuration and monitored.. However, the requirement to obtain formal authorization for interconnection is an organizational responsibility. The stack itself cannot grant or record â\x80\x9Cinterconnection agreements;â\x80\x9D it can only enforce security on the connection.)"
