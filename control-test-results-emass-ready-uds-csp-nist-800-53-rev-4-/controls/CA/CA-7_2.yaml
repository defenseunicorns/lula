  Description:

  The organization develops a continuous monitoring strategy and implements a
  continuous monitoring program that includes:

  a. Establishment of [Assignment: organization-defined metrics] to be
  monitored; 

  b. Establishment of [Assignment: organization-defined frequencies] for
  monitoring and [Assignment: organization-defined frequencies] for assessments
  supporting such monitoring;

  c. Ongoing security control assessments in accordance with the organizational
  continuous monitoring strategy;

  d. Ongoing security status monitoring of organization-defined metrics in
  accordance with the organizational continuous monitoring strategy;

  e. Correlation and analysis of security-related information generated by
  assessments and monitoring;

  f. Response actions to address results of the analysis of security-related
  information; and

  g. Reporting the security status of organization and the information system to
  [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Continuous monitoring programs facilitate ongoing awareness of threats,
  vulnerabilities, and information security to support organizational risk
  management decisions. The terms continuous and ongoing imply that
  organizations assess/analyze security controls and information
  security-related risks at a frequency sufficient to support organizational
  risk-based decisions. The results of continuous monitoring programs generate
  appropriate risk response actions by organizations. Continuous monitoring
  programs also allow organizations to maintain the security authorizations of
  information systems and common controls over time in highly dynamic
  environments of operation with changing mission/business needs, threats,
  vulnerabilities, and technologies. Having access to security-related
  information on a continuing basis through reports/dashboards gives
  organizational officials the capability to make more effective and timely risk
  management decisions, including ongoing security authorization decisions.
  Automation supports more frequent updates to security authorization packages,
  hardware/software/firmware inventories, and other system information.
  Effectiveness is further enhanced when continuous monitoring outputs are
  formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable, actionable,
  relevant, and timely. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in
  accordance with the security categories of information systems. Related
  controls: CA-2, CA-5, CA-6, CM-3, CM-4, PM-6, PM-9, RA-5, SA-11, SA-12, SI-2,
  SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

test-results: "Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Continuous monitoring in NIST terms involves tracking security state on an ongoing basis. UDS contributes significantly to technical continuous monitoring: NeuVector continuously monitors runtime for threats and compliance issues, Prometheus and Grafana continuously monitor system health and can detect anomalies, and logs are continuously collected for review. These tools provide an ongoing view of security (e.g., vulnerability scan results are updated as new images are deployed, network attacks are caught in real time). However, a full continuous monitoring program includes analyzing those results and updating risk assessments periodically, which involves personnel. UDS automates the data collection and part of the analysis (real-time alerts), effectively implementing the technical monitoring portion of CA-7. What it doesn√¢\x80\x99t do by itself is the formal reporting and review cycle (that is done by the cybersecurity team). So, the technological capability for continuous monitoring is present (covering events, vulnerabilities, compliance drift), but integrating that into an official program is up to the organization.)"
