control-information: >-
  Description:

  Determine if system components have applicable security-relevant software and
  firmware updates installed using [Assignment: organization-defined automated
  mechanisms] [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Automated mechanisms can track and determine the status of known flaws for
  system components. Related Control(s): CA-7, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing flaw remediation;
  automated mechanisms supporting centralized management of flaw remediation;
  system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system audit records; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system; organizational
  personnel responsible for flaw remediation].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms used to determine the state of system
  components with regard to flaw remediation].

implementation-guidance: CCI-004957 and CCI-004958 of this assessment procedure
  are automatically compliant because of coverage by DoD Enterprise.

test-results: Defense Unicorns will provide updated and hardened images at a
  frequency according to the SLA between the organization. Defense Unicorns
  provides this as a service to organizations and is automated. Defense Unicorns
  provides updated vulnerability databases according to the agreed frequency per
  the SLA to easily determine the flaw remediation state in the UDS UI. DoD has
  defined the frequency as 30 days for any additional internal network scans not
  covered by HBSS; annually for external scans by (Computer Network Defense
  Service Provider) CNDSP.
rev-4-migration-notes: "Automatically generated test result during Revision 5
  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: SI-2(2).1, SI-2(2).2; as well as the following Rev. 5 security
  requirements: CCI-004955, CCI-004956, CCI-004957, CCI-004958, CCI-004959,
  CCI-004960. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  of the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that
  has not been previously assessed: CCI-004955, CCI-004956, CCI-004957,
  CCI-004958, CCI-004959, CCI-004960."
