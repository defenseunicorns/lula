control-information: >-
  Description:

  Verify the integrity of the boot process of the following system components:
  [Assignment: organization-defined system components].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Ensuring the integrity of boot processes is critical to starting system
  components in known, trustworthy states. Integrity verification mechanisms
  provide a level of assurance that only trusted code is executed during boot
  processes. Related Control(s): SI-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing software, firmware,
  and information integrity; system design documentation; system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; integrity verification tools and
  associated documentation; documentation; records of integrity verification
  scans; system audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel responsible for software,
  firmware, and/or information integrity; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Software, firmware, and information integrity verification
  tools; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing integrity verification of the
  boot process].
