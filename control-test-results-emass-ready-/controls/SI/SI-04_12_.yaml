control-acronym: "[r5] SI-04(12)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Alert [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] using [Assignment:
  organization-defined automated mechanisms] when the following indications of
  inappropriate or unusual activities with security or privacy implications
  occur: [Assignment: organization-defined activities that trigger alerts].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizational personnel on the system alert notification list include system
  administrators, mission or business owners, system owners, senior agency
  information security officer, senior agency official for privacy, system
  security officers, or privacy officers. Automated organization-generated
  alerts are the security alerts generated by organizations and transmitted
  using automated means. The sources for organization-generated alerts are
  focused on other entities such as suspicious activity reports and reports on
  potential insider threats. In contrast to alerts generated by the
  organization, alerts generated by the system in SI-4(5) focus on information
  sources that are internal to the systems, such as audit records. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing system monitoring
  tools and techniques; system design documentation; system monitoring tools and
  techniques documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; list of inappropriate or unusual activities with security and
  privacy implications that trigger alerts; suspicious activity reports; alerts
  provided to security and privacy personnel; system monitoring logs or records;
  system audit records; system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities; system
  developers; organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or
  maintaining the system; organizational personnel responsible for monitoring
  the system; organizational personnel responsible for the intrusion detection
  system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for intrusion detection and
  system monitoring; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  intrusion detection and system monitoring capabilities; automated mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing automated alerts to security personnel].

implementation-guidance: CCI-001275 and CCI-004980 of this assessment procedure
  are automatically compliant because of coverage by DoD Enterprise.

  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: SI-4(12).1, SI-4(12).2; as well as the following Rev. 5 security
  requirements: CCI-004980. The resulting compliance status was set to
