control-acronym: "[r5] SI-08"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Employ spam protection mechanisms at system entry and exit points to detect
  and act on unsolicited messages; and

  b. Update spam protection mechanisms when new releases are available in
  accordance with organizational configuration management policy and procedures.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  System entry and exit points include firewalls, remote-access servers,
  electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, workstations, notebook
  computers, and mobile devices. Spam can be transported by different means,
  including email, email attachments, and web accesses. Spam protection
  mechanisms include signature definitions. Related Control(s): PL-9, SC-5,
  SC-7, SC-38, SI-3, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; configuration management policies and
  procedures (CM-1); procedures addressing spam protection; spam protection
  mechanisms; records of spam protection updates; system design documentation;
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit
  records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel responsible for spam
  protection; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for implementing spam protection;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing spam protection].

  Determine if:

  - spam protection mechanisms are employed at system entry points to detect
  unsolicited messages.

  - spam protection mechanisms are employed at system exit points to detect
  unsolicited messages.

  - spam protection mechanisms are employed at system entry points to act on
  unsolicited messages.

  - spam protection mechanisms are employed at system exit points to act on
  unsolicited messages.

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: SI-8.1, SI-8.2.
  The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following
  Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance
  statement: SI-8.1, SI-8.2.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Spam protection – relates to
  filtering spam in email or inputs. UDS doesn’t have an email system or
  user-generated content filtering; that’s outside scope. If an app on UDS was
  an email server, that app would need spam filtering, but the platform itself
  is neutral here.)
