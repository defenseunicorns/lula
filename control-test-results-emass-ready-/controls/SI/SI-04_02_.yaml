control-acronym: "[r5] SI-04(02)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Employ automated tools and mechanisms to support near real-time analysis of
  events.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Automated tools and mechanisms include host-based, network-based,
  transport-based, or storage-based event monitoring tools and mechanisms or
  security information and event management (SIEM) technologies that provide
  real-time analysis of alerts and notifications generated by organizational
  systems. Automated monitoring techniques can create unintended privacy risks
  because automated controls may connect to external or otherwise unrelated
  systems. The matching of records between these systems may create linkages
  with unintended consequences. Organizations assess and document these risks in
  their privacy impact assessment and make determinations that are in alignment
  with their privacy program plan. Related Control(s): PM-23, PM-25.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing system monitoring
  tools and techniques; system design documentation; system monitoring tools and
  techniques documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system audit records; system security plan; privacy plan;
  privacy program plan; privacy impact assessment; privacy risk management
  documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities;
  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the
  system; organizational personnel responsible for monitoring the system;
  organizational personnel responsible for incident response/management].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for the near real-time analysis
  of events; organizational processes for system monitoring; mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing system monitoring; mechanisms/tools supporting
  and/or implementing an analysis of events].
