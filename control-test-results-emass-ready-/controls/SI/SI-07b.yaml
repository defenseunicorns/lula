control-acronym: "[r5] SI-07"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Employ integrity verification tools to detect unauthorized changes to the
  following software, firmware, and information: [Assignment:
  organization-defined software, firmware, and information]; and

  b. Take the following actions when unauthorized changes to the software,
  firmware, and information are detected: [Assignment: organization-defined
  actions].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Unauthorized changes to software, firmware, and information can occur due to
  errors or malicious activity. Software includes operating systems (with key
  internal components, such as kernels or drivers), middleware, and
  applications. Firmware interfaces include Unified Extensible Firmware
  Interface (UEFI) and Basic Input/Output System (BIOS). Information includes
  personally identifiable information and metadata that contains security and
  privacy attributes associated with information. Integrity-checking
  mechanisms—including parity checks, cyclical redundancy checks, cryptographic
  hashes, and associated tools—can automatically monitor the integrity of
  systems and hosted applications. Related Control(s): AC-4, CM-3, CM-7, CM-8,
  MA-3, MA-4, RA-5, SA-8, SA-9, SA-10, SC-8, SC-12, SC-13, SC-28, SC-37, SI-3,
  SR-3, SR-4, SR-5, SR-6, SR-9, SR-10, SR-11.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing software, firmware,
  and information integrity; personally identifiable information processing
  policy; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; integrity verification tools and associated
  documentation; records generated or triggered by integrity verification tools
  regarding unauthorized software, firmware, and information changes; system
  audit records; system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel responsible for software,
  firmware, and/or information integrity; organizational personnel with
  information security and privacy responsibilities; system/network
  administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Software, firmware, and information integrity verification
  tools].
