control-acronym: "[r5] SI-15"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Validate information output from the following software programs and/or
  applications to ensure that the information is consistent with the expected
  content: [Assignment: organization-defined software programs and/or
  applications].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Certain types of attacks, including SQL injections, produce output results
  that are unexpected or inconsistent with the output results that would be
  expected from software programs or applications. Information output filtering
  focuses on detecting extraneous content, preventing such extraneous content
  from being displayed, and then alerting monitoring tools that anomalous
  behavior has been discovered. Related Control(s): SI-3, SI-4, SI-11.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing information output
  filtering; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; system audit records; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel responsible for validating
  information output; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for validating information
  output; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing information output
  validation].
