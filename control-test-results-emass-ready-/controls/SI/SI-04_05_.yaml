control-acronym: "[r5] SI-04(05)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Alert [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] when the following
  system-generated indications of compromise or potential compromise occur:
  [Assignment: organization-defined compromise indicators].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Alerts may be generated from a variety of sources, including audit records or
  inputs from malicious code protection mechanisms, intrusion detection or
  prevention mechanisms, or boundary protection devices such as firewalls,
  gateways, and routers. Alerts can be automated and may be transmitted
  telephonically, by electronic mail messages, or by text messaging.
  Organizational personnel on the alert notification list can include system
  administrators, mission or business owners, system owners, information
  owners/stewards, senior agency information security officers, senior agency
  officials for privacy, system security officers, or privacy officers. In
  contrast to alerts generated by the system, alerts generated by organizations
  in SI-4(12) focus on information sources external to the system, such as
  suspicious activity reports and reports on potential insider threats. Related
  Control(s): AU-4, AU-5, PE-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing system monitoring
  tools and techniques; system monitoring tools and techniques documentation;
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; list of personnel
  selected to receive alerts; documentation of alerts generated based on
  compromise indicators; system audit records; system security plan; privacy
  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities; system
  developers; organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or
  maintaining the system; organizational personnel responsible for monitoring
  the system; organizational personnel on the system alert notification list;
  organizational personnel responsible for the intrusion detection system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for intrusion detection and
  system monitoring; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing intrusion
  detection and system monitoring capabilities; mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing alerts for compromise indicators].

  UDS system-generated alerts (from NeuVector, Prometheus, Keycloak events,
  etc.) are themselves subject to monitoring. Essentially this means having a
  process to ensure that when an alert is triggered, it’s noticed and handled.
  UDS’s integration of these tools ensures alerts are centralized (e.g., sent to
  a Mattermost or email via Alertmanager, or shown on a dashboard). The security
  team can monitor the customized dashboard which will show any critical alerts
  in real time. Since we already established automated alerting, here we ensure
  there’s a mechanism for those alerts to be consumed which falls slightly into
  procedure. However, from a technical view, UDS consolidates alerts and
  provides views that security personnel can monitor continuously. If needed,
  integration with SIEM or ticketing can be done so no alert falls through
  cracks. This satisfies the requirement that the system’s alert outputs are
  themselves effectively monitored and responded to.
