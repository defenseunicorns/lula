control-information: >-
  Description:

  Implement [Assignment: organization-defined additional monitoring] of
  individuals who have been identified by [Assignment: organization-defined
  sources] as posing an increased level of risk.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Indications of increased risk from individuals can be obtained from different
  sources, including personnel records, intelligence agencies, law enforcement
  organizations, and other sources. The monitoring of individuals is coordinated
  with the management, legal, security, privacy, and human resource officials
  who conduct such monitoring. Monitoring is conducted in accordance with
  applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies,
  standards, and guidelines. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing system monitoring;
  system design documentation; system monitoring tools and techniques
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system audit records; system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities;
  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the
  system; organizational personnel responsible for monitoring the system; legal
  counsel; human resource officials; organizational personnel with personnel
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for system monitoring; mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing a system monitoring capability].
