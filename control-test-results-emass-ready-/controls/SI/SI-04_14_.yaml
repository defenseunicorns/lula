control-information: >-
  Description:

  Employ a wireless intrusion detection system to identify rogue wireless
  devices and to detect attack attempts and potential compromises or breaches to
  the system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Wireless signals may radiate beyond organizational facilities. Organizations
  proactively search for unauthorized wireless connections, including the
  conduct of thorough scans for unauthorized wireless access points. Wireless
  scans are not limited to those areas within facilities containing systems but
  also include areas outside of facilities to verify that unauthorized wireless
  access points are not connected to organizational systems. Related Control(s):
  AC-18, IA-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing system monitoring
  tools and techniques; system design documentation; system monitoring tools and
  techniques documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system protocols; system audit records; system security plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system; organizational
  personnel responsible for monitoring the system; organizational personnel
  responsible for the intrusion detection system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for intrusion detection;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing a wireless intrusion detection
  capability].

  Determine if:

  - a wireless intrusion detection system is employed to identify rogue wireless
  devices.

  - a wireless intrusion detection system is employed to detect attack attempts
  on the system.

  - a wireless intrusion detection system is employed to detect potential
  compromises or breaches to the system.
