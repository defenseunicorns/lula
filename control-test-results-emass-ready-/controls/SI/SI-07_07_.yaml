control-acronym: "[r5] SI-07(07)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Incorporate the detection of the following unauthorized changes into the
  organizational incident response capability: [Assignment: organization-defined
  security-relevant changes to the system].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Integrating detection and response helps to ensure that detected events are
  tracked, monitored, corrected, and available for historical purposes.
  Maintaining historical records is important for being able to identify and
  discern adversary actions over an extended time period and for possible legal
  actions. Security-relevant changes include unauthorized changes to established
  configuration settings or the unauthorized elevation of system privileges.
  Related Control(s): AU-2, AU-6, IR-4, IR-5, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing software, firmware,
  and information integrity; procedures addressing incident response; system
  design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; incident response records; audit records; system security plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel responsible for software,
  firmware, and/or information integrity; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; organizational personnel with incident
  response responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for incorporating the detection
  of unauthorized security-relevant changes into the incident response
  capability; software, firmware, and information integrity verification tools;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the incorporation of detection of
  unauthorized security-relevant changes into the incident response capability].

test-results: In UDS, unauthorized security-relevant changes are defined as any
  deviations from the approved baseline configuration or software state such as
  unauthorized modifications to container images, configuration files, service
  mesh policies, or authentication settings that could compromise the system's
  security. These changes are identified through continuous monitoring and
  enforcement mechanisms provided by Pepr, NeuVector, and Kubernetes audit logs,
  with additional visibility from Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki. Once such
  deviations are detected, they are flagged as security incidents and integrated
  into the incident response capability, triggering alerts and initiating
  forensic analysis to enable rapid containment and remediation.
