control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Implement [Selection (one or more): signature based; non-signature based]
  malicious code protection mechanisms at system entry and exit points to detect
  and eradicate malicious code;

  b. Automatically update malicious code protection mechanisms as new releases
  are available in accordance with organizational configuration management
  policy and procedures;

  c. Configure malicious code protection mechanisms to:

  1. Perform periodic scans of the system [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency] and real-time scans of files from external sources at [Selection
  (one or more): endpoint; network entry and exit points] as the files are
  downloaded, opened, or executed in accordance with organizational policy; and

  2. [Selection (one or more): block malicious code; quarantine malicious code;
  take [Assignment: organization-defined action]]; and send alert to
  [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] in response to malicious
  code detection; and

  d. Address the receipt of false positives during malicious code detection and
  eradication and the resulting potential impact on the availability of the
  system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  System entry and exit points include firewalls, remote access servers,
  workstations, electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, notebook
  computers, and mobile devices. Malicious code includes viruses, worms, Trojan
  horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded in various formats
  contained within compressed or hidden files or hidden in files using
  techniques such as steganography. Malicious code can be inserted into systems
  in a variety of ways, including by electronic mail, the world-wide web, and
  portable storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the
  exploitation of system vulnerabilities. A variety of technologies and methods
  exist to limit or eliminate the effects of malicious code.


  Malicious code protection mechanisms include both signature- and
  nonsignature-based technologies. Nonsignature-based detection mechanisms
  include artificial intelligence techniques that use heuristics to detect,
  analyze, and describe the characteristics or behavior of malicious code and to
  provide controls against such code for which signatures do not yet exist or
  for which existing signatures may not be effective. Malicious code for which
  active signatures do not yet exist or may be ineffective includes polymorphic
  malicious code (i.e., code that changes signatures when it replicates).
  Nonsignature-based mechanisms also include reputation-based technologies. In
  addition to the above technologies, pervasive configuration management,
  comprehensive software integrity controls, and anti-exploitation software may
  be effective in preventing the execution of unauthorized code. Malicious code
  may be present in commercial off-the-shelf software as well as custom-built
  software and could include logic bombs, backdoors, and other types of attacks
  that could affect organizational mission and business functions.


  In situations where malicious code cannot be detected by detection methods or
  technologies, organizations rely on other types of controls, including secure
  coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement
  processes, and monitoring practices to ensure that software does not perform
  functions other than the functions intended. Organizations may determine that,
  in response to the detection of malicious code, different actions may be
  warranted. For example, organizations can define actions in response to
  malicious code detection during periodic scans, the detection of malicious
  downloads, or the detection of maliciousness when attempting to open or
  execute files. Related Control(s): AC-4, AC-19, CM-3, CM-8, IR-4, MA-3, MA-4,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; configuration management policy and
  procedures; procedures addressing malicious code protection; malicious code
  protection mechanisms; records of malicious code protection updates; system
  design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; scan results from malicious code protection mechanisms; record
  of actions initiated by malicious code protection mechanisms in response to
  malicious code detection; system audit records; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system; organizational
  personnel responsible for malicious code protection; organizational personnel
  with configuration management responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for employing, updating, and
  configuring malicious code protection mechanisms; organizational processes for
  addressing false positives and resulting potential impacts; mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing, employing, updating, and configuring malicious
  code protection mechanisms; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  malicious code scanning and subsequent actions].
