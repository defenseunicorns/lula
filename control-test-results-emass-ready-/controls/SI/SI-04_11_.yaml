control-acronym: "[r5] SI-04(11)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Analyze outbound communications traffic at the external interfaces to the
  system and selected [Assignment: organization-defined interior points within
  the system] to discover anomalies.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organization-defined interior points include subnetworks and subsystems.
  Anomalies within organizational systems include large file transfers,
  long-time persistent connections, attempts to access information from
  unexpected locations, the use of unusual protocols and ports, the use of
  unmonitored network protocols (e.g., IPv6 usage during IPv4 transition), and
  attempted communications with suspected malicious external addresses. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing system monitoring
  tools and techniques; system design documentation; network diagram; system
  monitoring tools and techniques documentation; system configuration settings
  and associated documentation; system monitoring logs or records; system audit
  records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system; organizational
  personnel responsible for monitoring the system; organizational personnel
  responsible for the intrusion detection system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for intrusion detection and
  system monitoring; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing intrusion
  detection and system monitoring capabilities; mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing the analysis of communications traffic].
