control-acronym: "[r5] SI-04(04)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Determine criteria for unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions
  for inbound and outbound communications traffic;

  (b) Monitor inbound and outbound communications traffic [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] for [Assignment: organization-defined unusual
  or unauthorized activities or conditions].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions related to system inbound and
  outbound communications traffic includes internal traffic that indicates the
  presence of malicious code or unauthorized use of legitimate code or
  credentials within organizational systems or propagating among system
  components, signaling to external systems, and the unauthorized exporting of
  information. Evidence of malicious code or unauthorized use of legitimate code
  or credentials is used to identify potentially compromised systems or system
  components. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing system monitoring
  tools and techniques; system design documentation; system monitoring tools and
  techniques documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system protocols; system audit records; system security plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system; organizational
  personnel responsible for monitoring the system; organizational personnel
  responsible for the intrusion detection system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for intrusion detection and
  system monitoring; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing intrusion
  detection and system monitoring capabilities; mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing the monitoring of inbound and outbound communications traffic].
