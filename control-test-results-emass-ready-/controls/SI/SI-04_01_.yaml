  Description:

  Connect and configure individual intrusion detection tools into a system-wide
  intrusion detection system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Linking individual intrusion detection tools into a system-wide intrusion
  detection system provides additional coverage and effective detection
  capabilities. The information contained in one intrusion detection tool can be
  shared widely across the organization, making the system-wide detection
  capability more robust and powerful. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing system monitoring
  tools and techniques; system design documentation; system monitoring tools and
  techniques documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system audit records; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system; organizational
  personnel responsible for monitoring the system; organizational personnel
  responsible for the intrusion detection system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for intrusion detection and
  system monitoring; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing intrusion
  detection capabilities].
