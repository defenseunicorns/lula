control-acronym: "[r5] SI-11"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Generate error messages that provide information necessary for corrective
  actions without revealing information that could be exploited; and

  b. Reveal error messages only to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel
  or roles].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations consider the structure and content of error messages. The extent
  to which systems can handle error conditions is guided and informed by
  organizational policy and operational requirements. Exploitable information
  includes stack traces and implementation details; erroneous logon attempts
  with passwords mistakenly entered as the username; mission or business
  information that can be derived from, if not stated explicitly by, the
  information recorded; and personally identifiable information, such as account
  numbers, social security numbers, and credit card numbers. Error messages may
  also provide a covert channel for transmitting information. Related
  Control(s): AU-2, AU-3, SC-31, SI-2, SI-15.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing system error handling;
  system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; documentation providing the structure and content of error
  messages; system audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel responsible for information
  input validation; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for error handling; automated
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing error handling; automated mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing the management of error messages].

  On the UDS infrastructure side, system component errors (like a stack trace in
  Keycloak) are not exposed to end users in a way that would leak
  security-critical info. UDS logs errors internally for debugging but those are
  protected by systems administrator access through RBAC which ensures critical
  error information is only available to organization-defined personnel or
  roles.

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.
