control-acronym: "[r5] SI-02(04)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Employ automated patch management tools to facilitate flaw remediation to the
  following system components: [Assignment: organization-defined system
  components].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Using automated tools to support patch management helps to ensure the
  timeliness and completeness of system patching operations. Related Control(s):
  None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing flaw remediation;
  mechanisms supporting flaw remediation and automatic software/firmware
  updates; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; list of system flaws; records of recent
  security-relevant software and firmware updates that are automatically
  installed to system components; system audit records; system security plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system; organizational
  personnel responsible for flaw remediation].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated patch management tools; mechanisms implementing
  automatic software/firmware updates; mechanisms facilitating flaw remediation
  to system components].
