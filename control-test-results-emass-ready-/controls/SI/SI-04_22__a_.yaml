control-acronym: "[r5] SI-04(22)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Detect network services that have not been authorized or approved by
  [Assignment: organization-defined authorization or approval processes]; and

  (b)[Selection (one or more): Audit; Alert [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles]] when detected.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Unauthorized or unapproved network services include services in
  service-oriented architectures that lack organizational verification or
  validation and may therefore be unreliable or serve as malicious rogues for
  valid services. Related Control(s): CM-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing system monitoring
  tools and techniques; system design documentation; system monitoring tools and
  techniques documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; documented authorization/approval of network services;
  notifications or alerts of unauthorized network services; system monitoring
  logs or records; system audit records; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the
  system; organizational personnel responsible for monitoring the system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for system monitoring; mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing a system monitoring capability; mechanisms for
  auditing network services; mechanisms for providing alerts].
