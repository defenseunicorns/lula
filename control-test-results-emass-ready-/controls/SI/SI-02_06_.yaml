control-information: >-
  Description:

  Remove previous versions of [Assignment: organization-defined software and
  firmware components] after updated versions have been installed.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Previous versions of software or firmware components that are not removed from
  the system after updates have been installed may be exploited by adversaries.
  Some products may automatically remove previous versions of software and
  firmware from the system. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing flaw remediation;
  mechanisms supporting flaw remediation; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; records of software and
  firmware component removals after updated versions are installed; system audit
  records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system; organizational
  personnel responsible for flaw remediation].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the removal of
  previous versions of software/firmware].

  UDS inherently manages the lifecycle of software components through its
  containerized and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployment model using OpenTofu
  and Zarf packages. When software updates or new versions of components are
  installed, Kubernetes automatically removes outdated container images and
  deployments, ensuring only the current, approved versions remain operational.
