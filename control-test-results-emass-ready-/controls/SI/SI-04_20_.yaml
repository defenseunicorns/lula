control-acronym: "[r5] SI-04(20)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Implement the following additional monitoring of privileged users:
  [Assignment: organization-defined additional monitoring].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Privileged users have access to more sensitive information, including
  security-related information, than the general user population. Access to such
  information means that privileged users can potentially do greater damage to
  systems and organizations than non-privileged users. Therefore, implementing
  additional monitoring on privileged users helps to ensure that organizations
  can identify malicious activity at the earliest possible time and take
  appropriate actions. Related Control(s): AC-18.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing system monitoring
  tools and techniques; system design documentation; system monitoring tools and
  techniques documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system monitoring logs or records; system audit records; system
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system; organizational
  personnel responsible for monitoring the system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for system monitoring; mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing a system monitoring capability].

test-results: UDS implements robust monitoring of privileged user activities
  through its integrated logging and security components. Privileged actions
  performed in Keycloak (e.g., account creation, modification, disabling, or
  deletion) and administrative activities in Kubernetes are logged
  comprehensively and aggregated centrally via Vector and Loki, with detailed
  records including user identities, timestamps, actions performed, and source
  IP addresses.

  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: SI-4(20).1, SI-4(20).2. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally
