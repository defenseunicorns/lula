control-acronym: "[r5] SI-04(10)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Make provisions so that [Assignment: organization-defined encrypted
  communications traffic] is visible to [Assignment: organization-defined system
  monitoring tools and mechanisms].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations balance the need to encrypt communications traffic to protect
  data confidentiality with the need to maintain visibility into such traffic
  from a monitoring perspective. Organizations determine whether the visibility
  requirement applies to internal encrypted traffic, encrypted traffic intended
  for external destinations, or a subset of the traffic types. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing system monitoring
  tools and techniques; system design documentation; system monitoring tools and
  techniques documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system protocols; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system; organizational
  personnel responsible for monitoring the system; organizational personnel
  responsible for the intrusion detection system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for intrusion detection and
  system monitoring; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing intrusion
  detection and system monitoring capabilities; mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing the visibility of encrypted communications traffic to monitoring
  tools].
