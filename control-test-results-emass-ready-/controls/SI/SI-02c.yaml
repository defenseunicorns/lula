  Description:

  a. Identify, report, and correct system flaws;

  b. Test software and firmware updates related to flaw remediation for
  effectiveness and potential side effects before installation;

  c. Install security-relevant software and firmware updates within [Assignment:
  organization-defined time period] of the release of the updates; and

  d. Incorporate flaw remediation into the organizational configuration
  management process.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The need to remediate system flaws applies to all types of software and
  firmware. Organizations identify systems affected by software flaws, including
  potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws, and report this
  information to designated organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy responsibilities. Security-relevant updates include patches,
  service packs, and malicious code signatures. Organizations also address flaws
  discovered during assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response
  activities, and system error handling. By incorporating flaw remediation into
  configuration management processes, required remediation actions can be
  tracked and verified.


  Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and
  firmware may vary based on a variety of risk factors, including the security
  category of the system, the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the
  vulnerability related to the discovered flaw), the organizational risk
  tolerance, the mission supported by the system, or the threat environment.
  Some types of flaw remediation may require more testing than other types.
  Organizations determine the type of testing needed for the specific type of
  flaw remediation activity under consideration and the types of changes that
  are to be configuration-managed. In some situations, organizations may
  determine that the testing of software or firmware updates is not necessary or
  practical, such as when implementing simple malicious code signature updates.
  In testing decisions, organizations consider whether security-relevant
  software or firmware updates are obtained from authorized sources with
  appropriate digital signatures. Related Control(s): CA-5, CM-3, CM-4, CM-5,
  CM-6, CM-8, MA-2, RA-5, SA-8, SA-10, SA-11, SI-3, SI-5, SI-7, SI-11.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing flaw remediation;
  procedures addressing configuration management; list of flaws and
  vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system; list of recent security flaw
  remediation actions performed on the system (e.g., list of installed patches,
  service packs, hot fixes, and other software updates to correct system flaws);
  test results from the installation of software and firmware updates to correct
  system flaws; installation/change control records for security-relevant
  software and firmware updates; system security plan; privacy plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities;
  organizational personnel responsible for installing, configuring, and/or
  maintaining the system; organizational personnel responsible for flaw
  remediation; organizational personnel with configuration management
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for identifying, reporting, and
  correcting system flaws; organizational process for installing software and
  firmware updates; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the reporting and
  correcting of system flaws; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing testing
  software and firmware updates].

  Determine if:

  - security-relevant software updates are installed within [Assignment:
  organization-defined time period] of the release of the updates.

  - security-relevant firmware updates are installed within [Assignment:

test-results: UDS inherently supports and simplifies the timely installation of
  security-relevant software updates through its containerized architecture,
  Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach via OpenTofu, and secure software
  bundling through Zarf packages. These features enable rapid and consistent
  deployment of updates, significantly facilitating compliance with the
  DoD-defined 30-day timeframe for patching. Defense Unicorns will provide
  updated and hardened images at a frequency according to the SLA between the
  organization.
