control-information: >-
  Description:

  Implement the following host-based monitoring mechanisms at [Assignment:
  organization-defined system components]: [Assignment: organization-defined
  host-based monitoring mechanisms].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Host-based monitoring collects information about the host (or system in which
  it resides). System components in which host-based monitoring can be
  implemented include servers, notebook computers, and mobile devices.
  Organizations may consider employing host-based monitoring mechanisms from
  multiple product developers or vendors. Related Control(s): AC-18, AC-19.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing system monitoring
  tools and techniques; system design documentation; host-based monitoring
  mechanisms; system monitoring tools and techniques documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; list of system components
  requiring host-based monitoring; system monitoring logs or records; system
  audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system; organizational
  personnel responsible for monitoring system hosts].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for system monitoring; mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing a host-based monitoring capability].

  In UDS, host-based monitoring is implemented across each critical system
  component using a combination of telemetry and security agents. The Kubernetes
  Metrics Server gathers host-level performance data such as CPU, memory, and
  disk I/O usage from each node, which Prometheus collects and Grafana
  visualizes for ongoing performance tracking and anomaly detection.

  The organization being inspected/assessed is automatically compliant with this
  CCI because they are covered at the DoD level. DoD has defined the information
  system components as all components.
