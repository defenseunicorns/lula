  Description:

  Discover, collect, and distribute to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles], indicators of compromise provided by [Assignment:
  organization-defined sources].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Indicators of compromise (IOC) are forensic artifacts from intrusions that are
  identified on organizational systems at the host or network level. IOCs
  provide valuable information on systems that have been compromised. IOCs can
  include the creation of registry key values. IOCs for network traffic include
  Universal Resource Locator or protocol elements that indicate malicious code
  command and control servers. The rapid distribution and adoption of IOCs can
  improve information security by reducing the time that systems and
  organizations are vulnerable to the same exploit or attack. Threat indicators,
  signatures, tactics, techniques, procedures, and other indicators of
  compromise may be available via government and non-government cooperatives,
  including the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams, the United States
  Computer Emergency Readiness Team, the Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity
  Information Sharing Program, and the CERT Coordination Center. Related
  Control(s): AC-18.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing system monitoring;
  system design documentation; system monitoring tools and techniques
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system monitoring logs or records; system audit records; system security plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the
  system; organizational personnel responsible for monitoring system hosts].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for system monitoring;
  organizational processes for the discovery, collection, distribution, and use
  of indicators of compromise; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing a
  system monitoring capability; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the
  discovery, collection, distribution, and use of indicators of compromise].
