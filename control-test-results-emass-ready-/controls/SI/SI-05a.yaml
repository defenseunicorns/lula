control-acronym: "[r5] SI-05"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Receive system security alerts, advisories, and directives from
  [Assignment: organization-defined external organizations] on an ongoing basis;

  b. Generate internal security alerts, advisories, and directives as deemed
  necessary;

  c. Disseminate security alerts, advisories, and directives to: [Selection (one
  or more): [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]; [Assignment:
  organization-defined elements within the organization]; [Assignment:
  organization-defined external organizations]]; and

  d. Implement security directives in accordance with established time frames,
  or notify the issuing organization of the degree of noncompliance.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) generates security
  alerts and advisories to maintain situational awareness throughout the Federal
  Government. Security directives are issued by OMB or other designated
  organizations with the responsibility and authority to issue such directives.
  Compliance with security directives is essential due to the critical nature of
  many of these directives and the potential (immediate) adverse effects on
  organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and
  the Nation should the directives not be implemented in a timely manner.
  External organizations include supply chain partners, external mission or
  business partners, external service providers, and other peer or supporting
  organizations. Related Control(s): PM-15, RA-5, SI-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing security alerts,
  advisories, and directives; records of security alerts and advisories; system
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security alert and
  advisory responsibilities; organizational personnel implementing, operating,
  maintaining, and using the system; organizational personnel, organizational
  elements, and/or external organizations to whom alerts, advisories, and
  directives are to be disseminated; system/network administrators;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for defining, receiving,
  generating, disseminating, and complying with security alerts, advisories, and
  directives; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the definition, receipt,
  generation, and dissemination of security alerts, advisories, and directives;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing security directives].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: SI-5.1, SI-5.2.
  The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following
  Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance
  statement: SI-5.1.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Organizational security alerts,
  advisories, and directives are managed outside of UDS.)
