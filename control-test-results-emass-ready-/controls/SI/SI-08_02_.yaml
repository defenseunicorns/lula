  Description:

  Automatically update spam protection mechanisms [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Using automated mechanisms to update spam protection mechanisms helps to
  ensure that updates occur on a regular basis and provide the latest content
  and protection capabilities. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing spam protection; spam
  protection mechanisms; records of spam protection updates; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel responsible for spam
  protection; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for spam protection; mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing automatic updates to spam protection
  mechanisms].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: SI-8(2).1; as well
  as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-005002. The resulting
  compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following Rev. 4
  assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance statement:
  SI-8(2).1. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because of
  the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that
  has not been previously assessed: CCI-005002.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Spam protection – relates to
  filtering spam in email or inputs. UDS doesn’t have an email system or
  user-generated content filtering; that’s outside scope. If an app on UDS was
  an email server, that app would need spam filtering, but the platform itself
  is neutral here.)
