  Description:

  Prevent untrusted data injections.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Untrusted data injections may be prevented using a parameterized interface or
  output escaping (output encoding). Parameterized interfaces separate data from
  code so that injections of malicious or unintended data cannot change the
  semantics of commands being sent. Output escaping uses specified characters to
  inform the interpreterâ€™s parser whether data is trusted. Prevention of
  untrusted data injections are with respect to the information inputs defined
  by the organization in the base control (SI-10). Related Control(s): AC-3,
  AC-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing information input
  validation; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; list of trusted sources for information inputs; list
  of acceptable formats for input restrictions; system audit records; system
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel responsible for information
  input validation; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for preventing untrusted data
  injections; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing injection
  prevention].
