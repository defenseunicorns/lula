control-information: >-
  Description:

  Verify that the system behaves in a predictable and documented manner when
  invalid inputs are received.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A common vulnerability in organizational systems is unpredictable behavior
  when invalid inputs are received. Verification of system predictability helps
  ensure that the system behaves as expected when invalid inputs are received.
  This occurs by specifying system responses that allow the system to transition
  to known states without adverse, unintended side effects. The invalid inputs
  are those related to the information inputs defined by the organization in the
  base control (SI-10). Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing information input
  validation; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; system audit records; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel responsible for information
  input validation; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  predictable behavior when invalid inputs are received].

test-results: Within UDS, Keycloak ensures the system responds predictably and
  consistently when invalid inputs are received. Specifically, when
  authentication or authorization inputs (such as malformed usernames, incorrect
  passwords, or invalid tokens) are submitted, Keycloak responds with
  standardized, generic error messages, avoiding detailed disclosures that could
  aid attackers. All invalid attempts are clearly recorded within Keycloakâ€™s
  detailed audit logs, enabling administrative monitoring and forensic analysis.
