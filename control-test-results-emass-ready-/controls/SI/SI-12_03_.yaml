  Description:

  Use the following techniques to dispose of, destroy, or erase information
  following the retention period: [Assignment: organization-defined techniques].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  information when it is no longer needed. The disposal or destruction of
  information applies to originals as well as copies and archived records,
  including system logs that may contain personally identifiable information.
  Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
