control-acronym: "[r5] SI-02(03)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Measure the time between flaw identification and flaw remediation; and

  (b) Establish the following benchmarks for taking corrective actions:
  [Assignment: organization-defined benchmarks].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations determine the time it takes on average to correct system flaws
  after such flaws have been identified and subsequently establish
  organizational benchmarks (i.e., time frames) for taking corrective actions.
  Benchmarks can be established by the type of flaw or the severity of the
  potential vulnerability if the flaw can be exploited. Related Control(s):
  None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing flaw remediation;
  system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; list of benchmarks for taking corrective action on identified
  flaws; records that provide timestamps of flaw identification and subsequent
  flaw remediation activities; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system; organizational
  personnel responsible for flaw remediation].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for identifying, reporting, and
  correcting system flaws; mechanisms used to measure the time between flaw
  identification and flaw remediation].
