control-information: >-
  Description:

  Implement the following mechanisms to protect the integrity of boot firmware
  in [Assignment: organization-defined system components]: [Assignment:
  organization-defined mechanisms].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Unauthorized modifications to boot firmware may indicate a sophisticated,
  targeted attack. These types of targeted attacks can result in a permanent
  denial of service or a persistent malicious code presence. These situations
  can occur if the firmware is corrupted or if the malicious code is embedded
  within the firmware. System components can protect the integrity of boot
  firmware in organizational systems by verifying the integrity and authenticity
  of all updates to the firmware prior to applying changes to the system
  component and preventing unauthorized processes from modifying the boot
  firmware. Related Control(s): SI-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing software, firmware,
  and information integrity; system design documentation; system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; integrity verification tools and
  associated documentation; records of integrity verification scans; system
  audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel responsible for software,
  firmware, and/or information integrity; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system
  developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Software, firmware, and information integrity verification
  tools; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing protection of the integrity
  of boot firmware; safeguards implementing protection of the integrity of boot
  firmware].
