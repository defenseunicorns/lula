control-acronym: "[r5] SI-04(16)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Correlate information from monitoring tools and mechanisms employed throughout
  the system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Correlating information from different system monitoring tools and mechanisms
  can provide a more comprehensive view of system activity. Correlating system
  monitoring tools and mechanisms that typically work in isolation—including
  malicious code protection software, host monitoring, and network
  monitoring—can provide an organization-wide monitoring view and may reveal
  otherwise unseen attack patterns. Understanding the capabilities and
  limitations of diverse monitoring tools and mechanisms and how to maximize the
  use of information generated by those tools and mechanisms can help
  organizations develop, operate, and maintain effective monitoring programs.
  The correlation of monitoring information is especially important during the
  transition from older to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to
  IPv6 network protocols). Related Control(s): AU-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing system monitoring
  tools and techniques; system design documentation; system monitoring tools and
  techniques documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; event correlation logs or records; system audit records; system
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system; organizational
  personnel responsible for monitoring the system; organizational personnel
  responsible for the intrusion detection system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for intrusion detection and
  system monitoring; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing intrusion
  detection and system monitoring capabilities; mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing the correlation of information from monitoring tools].
