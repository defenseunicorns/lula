control-acronym: "[r5] SI-04(15)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Employ an intrusion detection system to monitor wireless communications
  traffic as the traffic passes from wireless to wireline networks.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Wireless networks are inherently less secure than wired networks. For example,
  wireless networks are more susceptible to eavesdroppers or traffic analysis
  than wireline networks. When wireless to wireline communications exist, the
  wireless network could become a port of entry into the wired network. Given
  the greater facility of unauthorized network access via wireless access points
  compared to unauthorized wired network access from within the physical
  boundaries of the system, additional monitoring of transitioning traffic
  between wireless and wired networks may be necessary to detect malicious
  activities. Employing intrusion detection systems to monitor wireless
  communications traffic helps to ensure that the traffic does not contain
  malicious code prior to transitioning to the wireline network. Related
  Control(s): AC-18.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing system monitoring
  tools and techniques; system design documentation; system monitoring tools and
  techniques documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system protocols documentation; system audit records; system
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system; organizational
  personnel responsible for monitoring the system; organizational personnel
  responsible for the intrusion detection system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for intrusion detection and
  system monitoring; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing intrusion
  detection and system monitoring capabilities; mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing a wireless intrusion detection capability].
