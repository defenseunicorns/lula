control-acronym: "[r5] SI-07(08)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Upon detection of a potential integrity violation, provide the capability to
  audit the event and initiate the following actions: [Selection (one or more):
  generate an audit record; alert current user; alert [Assignment:
  organization-defined personnel or roles]; [Assignment: organization-defined
  other actions]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations select response actions based on types of software, specific
  software, or information for which there are potential integrity violations.
  Related Control(s): AU-2, AU-6, AU-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing software, firmware,
  and information integrity; system design documentation; system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; integrity verification tools and
  associated documentation; records of integrity scans; incident response
  records; list of security-relevant changes to the system; automated tools
  supporting alerts and notifications if unauthorized security changes are
  detected; system audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel responsible for software,
  firmware, and/or information integrity; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system
  developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Software, firmware, and information integrity verification
  tools; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the capability to audit
  potential integrity violations; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  alerts about potential integrity violations].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: SI-7(8).1,
  SI-7(8).2, SI-7(8).3, SI-7(8).4. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally
  entered test result/compliance statement: SI-7(8).3.


  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.

  This likely refers to detecting unauthorized changes to software and
  information. As described, NeuVector is effectively doing this it will detect
  if any unexpected process or file change occurs in a container beyond what was
  present at deployment. Also, any changes to Kubernetes resources (adding a new
  pod, changing a config) are logged and can be monitored an unauthorized change
  (like someone applying a manifest outside of GitOps) can trigger an alert via
  admission control tools (Pepr could block or log it). So the infrastructure is
  in place to catch if something deviates from the baseline. This could be
  considered integrity monitoring. For example, if an attacker managed to modify
  a container image on disk, its hash would differ and would notice either
  failing to start the container or flagging it as un-scanned. UDS covers
  continuous verification and alerts on any unauthorized modifications.

  In UDS, when a potential integrity violation is detected, the system
  automatically generates a detailed audit record capturing critical information
  such as timestamps, affected components, user or service identities, and the
  nature of the violation. This capability is provided by integrated logging
  tools like Loki and enforced through Pepr policies and NeuVectorâ€™s monitoring,
  ensuring that all events are documented in a tamper-resistant manner for
  subsequent forensic analysis and incident response.

  UDS actively responds to potential integrity violations through its integrated
  security tools. Specifically, NeuVector immediately detects unauthorized
  container modifications, runtime anomalies, and integrity deviations,
  automatically generating detailed audit records and real-time alerts to
  designated security administrators. Additionally, Vector and Loki aggregate
  these security event logs, preserving detailed audit trails. Alerts generated
  by NeuVector and metrics monitored via Prometheus and Grafana ensure rapid
  visibility of potential integrity violations, notifying defined organizational
  personnel or security roles to facilitate timely incident response.
  Collectively, these capabilities meet the requirement by promptly initiating
  audit logging and alerting actions upon detection of potential integrity
  violations.
