control-acronym: "[r5] SI-10"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Check the validity of the following information inputs: [Assignment:
  organization-defined information inputs to the system].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Checking the valid syntax and semantics of system inputs—including character
  set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values—verifies that inputs match
  specified definitions for format and content. For example, if the organization
  specifies that numerical values between 1-100 are the only acceptable inputs
  for a field in a given application, inputs of 387, abc, or %K% are invalid
  inputs and are not accepted as input to the system. Valid inputs are likely to
  vary from field to field within a software application. Applications typically
  follow well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or
  queries) to communicate between software modules or system components.
  Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with
  metadata or control information. If software applications use
  attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly
  encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or
  special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control
  information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives
  the corrupted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret
  the data incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing them to
  interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as
  commands. Input validation ensures accurate and correct inputs and prevents
  attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.
  Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; access control policy and procedures;
  separation of duties policy and procedures; procedures addressing information
  input validation; documentation for automated tools and applications to verify
  the validity of information; list of information inputs requiring validity
  checks; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; system audit records; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel responsible for information
  input validation; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing validity checks
  on information inputs].

test-results: Keycloak performs input validation internally for authentication
  and authorization-related inputs, ensuring protection against common injection
  and malformed input attacks. It validates all authentication credentials,
  tokens, and form inputs (e.g., usernames, passwords, client IDs, OAuth
  parameters) received during user authentication or authorization flows.
  Keycloak specifically checks for format and structure validation. Ensures all
  input parameters conform to expected patterns (e.g., rejects malformed
  OAuth2/OIDC requests). Prevents injection attacks by enforcing strict parsing
  rules, escaping special characters, and rejecting inputs outside expected
  parameters. Cryptographically verifies the authenticity and integrity of JWT
  tokens, rejecting any tokens that fail verification. (UDS cannot universally
  enforce input validation for all applications; that is typically the
  responsibility of each application (e.g., a web app needs to validate user
  input to prevent SQL injection.)
