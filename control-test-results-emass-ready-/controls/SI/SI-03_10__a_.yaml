control-acronym: "[r5] SI-03(10)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Employ the following tools and techniques to analyze the characteristics
  and behavior of malicious code: [Assignment: organization-defined tools and
  techniques]; and

  (b) Incorporate the results from malicious code analysis into organizational
  incident response and flaw remediation processes.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The use of malicious code analysis tools provides organizations with a more
  in-depth understanding of adversary tradecraft (i.e., tactics, techniques, and
  procedures) and the functionality and purpose of specific instances of
  malicious code. Understanding the characteristics of malicious code
  facilitates effective organizational responses to current and future threats.
  Organizations can conduct malicious code analyses by employing reverse
  engineering techniques or by monitoring the behavior of executing code.
  Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing malicious code
  protection; procedures addressing incident response; procedures addressing
  flaw remediation; system design documentation; malicious code protection
  mechanisms, tools, and techniques; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; results from malicious code analyses; records of
  flaw remediation events resulting from malicious code analyses; system audit
  records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system; organizational
  personnel responsible for malicious code protection; organizational personnel
  responsible for flaw remediation; organizational personnel responsible for
  incident response/management].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational process for incident response;
  organizational process for flaw remediation; mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing malicious code protection capabilities; tools and techniques for
  the analysis of malicious code characteristics and behavior].
