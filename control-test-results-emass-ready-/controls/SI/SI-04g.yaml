control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Monitor the system to detect:

  1. Attacks and indicators of potential attacks in accordance with the
  following monitoring objectives: [Assignment: organization-defined monitoring
  objectives]; and

  2. Unauthorized local, network, and remote connections;

  b. Identify unauthorized use of the system through the following techniques
  and methods: [Assignment: organization-defined techniques and methods];

  c. Invoke internal monitoring capabilities or deploy monitoring devices:

  1. Strategically within the system to collect organization-determined
  essential information; and

  2. At ad hoc locations within the system to track specific types of
  transactions of interest to the organization;

  d. Analyze detected events and anomalies;

  e. Adjust the level of system monitoring activity when there is a change in
  risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
  organizations, or the Nation;

  f. Obtain legal opinion regarding system monitoring activities; and

  g. Provide [Assignment: organization-defined system monitoring information] to
  [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] [Selection (one or
  more): as needed; [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  System monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. External
  monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at external interfaces
  to the system. Internal monitoring includes the observation of events
  occurring within the system. Organizations monitor systems by observing audit
  activities in real time or by observing other system aspects such as access
  patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring
  objectives guide and inform the determination of the events. System monitoring
  capabilities are achieved through a variety of tools and techniques, including
  intrusion detection and prevention systems, malicious code protection
  software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, and network
  monitoring software.


  Depending on the security architecture, the distribution and configuration of
  monitoring devices may impact throughput at key internal and external
  boundaries as well as at other locations across a network due to the
  introduction of network throughput latency. If throughput management is
  needed, such devices are strategically located and deployed as part of an
  established organization-wide security architecture. Strategic locations for
  monitoring devices include selected perimeter locations and near key servers
  and server farms that support critical applications. Monitoring devices are
  typically employed at the managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7 and
  AC-17. The information collected is a function of the organizational
  monitoring objectives and the capability of systems to support such
  objectives. Specific types of transactions of interest include Hypertext
  Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP proxies. System monitoring
  is an integral part of organizational continuous monitoring and incident
  response programs, and output from system monitoring serves as input to those
  programs. System monitoring requirements, including the need for specific
  types of system monitoring, may be referenced in other controls (e.g., AC-2g,
  AC-2(7), AC-2(12)(a), AC-17(1), AU-13, AU-13(1), AU-13(2), CM-3f, CM-6d,
  MA-3a, MA-4a, SC-5(3)(b), SC-7a, SC-7(24)(b), SC-18b, SC-43b). Adjustments to
  levels of system monitoring are based on law enforcement information,
  intelligence information, or other sources of information. The legality of
  system monitoring activities is based on applicable laws, executive orders,
  directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Related

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; procedures addressing system monitoring
  tools and techniques; continuous monitoring strategy; facility diagram/layout;
  system design documentation; system monitoring tools and techniques
  documentation; locations within the system where monitoring devices are
  deployed; system configuration settings and associated documentation; system
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system; organizational
  personnel responsible for monitoring the system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for system monitoring; mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing system monitoring capabilities].
