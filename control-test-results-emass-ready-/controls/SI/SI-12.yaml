control-information: >-
  Description:

  Manage and retain information within the system and information output from
  the system in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives,
  regulations, policies, standards, guidelines and operational requirements.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information management and retention requirements cover the full life cycle of
  information, in some cases extending beyond system disposal. Information to be
  retained may also include policies, procedures, plans, reports, data output
  from control implementation, and other types of administrative information.
  The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) provides federal
  policy and guidance on records retention and schedules. If organizations have
  a records management office, consider coordinating with records management
  personnel. Records produced from the output of implemented controls that may
  require management and retention include, but are not limited to: All XX-1,
  AC-6(9), AT-4, AU-12, CA-2, CA-3, CA-5, CA-6, CA-7, CA-8, CA-9, CM-2, CM-3,
  CM-4, CM-6, CM-8, CM-9, CM-12, CM-13, CP-2, IR-6, IR-8, MA-2, MA-4, PE-2,
  PE-8, PE-16, PE-17, PL-2, PL-4, PL-7, PL-8, PM-5, PM-8, PM-9, PM-18, PM-21,
  PM-27, PM-28, PM-30, PM-31, PS-2, PS-6, PS-7, PT-2, PT-3, PT-7, RA-2, RA-3,
  RA-5, RA-8, SA-4, SA-5, SA-8, SA-10, SI-4, SR-2, SR-4, SR-8. Related

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; system and
  information integrity procedures; personally identifiable information
  processing policy; records retention and disposition policy; records retention
  and disposition procedures; federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
  policies, regulations, standards, and operational requirements applicable to
  information management and retention; media protection policy; media
  protection procedures; audit findings; system security plan; privacy plan;
  privacy program plan; personally identifiable information inventory; privacy
  impact assessment; privacy risk assessment documentation; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information and records
  management, retention, and disposition responsibilities; organizational
  personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities; network
  administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for information management,
  retention, and disposition; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing information management, retention, and disposition].

  - information within the system is managed in accordance with applicable laws,
  Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines,
  and operational requirements.

  - information within the system is retained in accordance with applicable
  laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
  guidelines, and operational requirements.

test-results: UDS handles and maintains information according to organizational
  requirements but is dependent on the data being supported. Typically UDS
  setups configure data and backups to be maintained for one year but can be
  configured for longer.
