  Description:

  a. Document and monitor information security and privacy training activities,
  including security and privacy awareness training and specific role-based
  security and privacy training; and

  b. Retain individual training records for [Assignment: organization-defined
  time period].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Documentation for specialized training may be maintained by individual
  supervisors at the discretion of the organization. The National Archives and
  Records Administration provides guidance on records retention for federal
  agencies. Related Control(s): AT-2, AT-3, CP-3, IR-2, PM-14, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security and privacy awareness and training policy;
  procedures addressing security and privacy training records; security and
  privacy awareness and training records; system security plan; privacy plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy training record retention responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting the management of security and
  privacy training records].
