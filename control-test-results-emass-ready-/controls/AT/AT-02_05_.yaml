  Description:

  Provide literacy training on the advanced persistent threat.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  An effective way to detect advanced persistent threats (APT) and to preclude
  successful attacks is to provide specific literacy training for individuals.
  Threat literacy training includes educating individuals on the various ways
  that APTs can infiltrate the organization (e.g., through websites, emails,
  advertisement pop-ups, articles, and social engineering). Effective training
  includes techniques for recognizing suspicious emails, use of removable
  systems in non-secure settings, and the potential targeting of individuals at
  home. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System security plan; privacy plan; literacy training
  and awareness policy; procedures addressing literacy training and awareness
  implementation; literacy training and awareness curriculum; literacy training
  and awareness materials; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel who receive literacy
  training and awareness; organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  basic literacy training and awareness; organizational personnel with
  information security and privacy responsibilities].
