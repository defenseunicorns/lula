  Description:

  Provide literacy training on recognizing and reporting potential and actual
  instances of social engineering and social mining.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Social engineering is an attempt to trick an individual into revealing
  information or taking an action that can be used to breach, compromise, or
  otherwise adversely impact a system. Social engineering includes phishing,
  pretexting, impersonation, baiting, quid pro quo, thread-jacking, social media
  exploitation, and tailgating. Social mining is an attempt to gather
  information about the organization that may be used to support future attacks.
  Literacy training includes information on how to communicate the concerns of
  employees and management regarding potential and actual instances of social
  engineering and data mining through organizational channels based on
  established policies and procedures. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel who receive literacy
  training and awareness; organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  literacy training and awareness; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities].
