control-information: >-
  Description:

  Provide literacy training on recognizing suspicious communications and
  anomalous behavior in organizational systems using [Assignment:
  organization-defined indicators of malicious code].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A well-trained workforce provides another organizational control that can be
  employed as part of a defense-in-depth strategy to protect against malicious
  code coming into organizations via email or the web applications. Personnel
  are trained to look for indications of potentially suspicious email (e.g.,
  receiving an unexpected email, receiving an email containing strange or poor
  grammar, or receiving an email from an unfamiliar sender that appears to be
  from a known sponsor or contractor). Personnel are also trained on how to
  respond to suspicious email or web communications. For this process to work
  effectively, personnel are trained and made aware of what constitutes
  suspicious communications. Training personnel on how to recognize anomalous
  behaviors in systems can provide organizations with early warning for the
  presence of malicious code. Recognition of anomalous behavior by
  organizational personnel can supplement malicious code detection and
  protection tools and systems employed by organizations. Related Control(s):
  None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System security plan; privacy plan; literacy training
  and awareness policy; procedures addressing literacy training and awareness
  implementation; literacy training and awareness curriculum; literacy training
  and awareness materials; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel who receive literacy
  training and awareness; organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  basic literacy training and awareness; organizational personnel with
  information security and privacy responsibilities].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: AT-3(4).1,
  AT-3(4).2; as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-003777,
  CCI-003778. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test
  result/compliance statement: AT-3(4).1, AT-3(4).2. The resulting compliance
  status was set to non-compliant because of the addition of a new security
  requirement to the assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed:
  CCI-003777, CCI-003778.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS does not provide personnel
  training or awareness programs which must be addressed at the organizational
  level.)
