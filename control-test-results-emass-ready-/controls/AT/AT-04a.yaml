control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Document and monitor information security and privacy training activities,
  including security and privacy awareness training and specific role-based
  security and privacy training; and

  b. Retain individual training records for [Assignment: organization-defined
  time period].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Documentation for specialized training may be maintained by individual
  supervisors at the discretion of the organization. The National Archives and
  Records Administration provides guidance on records retention for federal
  agencies. Related Control(s): AT-2, AT-3, CP-3, IR-2, PM-14, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  procedures addressing security and privacy training records; security and
  privacy awareness and training records; system security plan; privacy plan;

  and privacy training record retention responsibilities].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: AT-4.1, AT-4.2; as
  well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-003794, CCI-003795.
  The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following
  Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance
  statement: AT-4.1. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant
  because of the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment
  procedure that has not been previously assessed: CCI-003794, CCI-003795.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS does not provide personnel
  training or awareness programs which must be addressed at the organizational
  level.)

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.
