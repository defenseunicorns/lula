control-information: >-
  Description:

  Provide literacy training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of
  insider threat.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Potential indicators and possible precursors of insider threat can include
  behaviors such as inordinate, long-term job dissatisfaction; attempts to gain
  access to information not required for job performance; unexplained access to
  financial resources; bullying or harassment of fellow employees; workplace
  violence; and other serious violations of policies, procedures, directives,
  regulations, rules, or practices. Literacy training includes how to
  communicate the concerns of employees and management regarding potential
  indicators of insider threat through channels established by the organization
  and in accordance with established policies and procedures. Organizations may
  consider tailoring insider threat awareness topics to the role. For example,
  training for managers may be focused on changes in the behavior of team
  members, while training for employees may be focused on more general
  observations. Related Control(s): PM-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
