  Description:

  Provide [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] with initial and
  [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] training in the employment and
  operation of personally identifiable information processing and transparency
  controls.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Personally identifiable information processing and transparency controls
  include the organizationâ€™s authority to process personally identifiable
  information and personally identifiable information processing purposes.
  Role-based training for federal agencies addresses the types of information
  that may constitute personally identifiable information and the risks,
  considerations, and obligations associated with its processing. Such training
  also considers the authority to process personally identifiable information
  documented in privacy policies and notices, system of records notices,
  computer matching agreements and notices, privacy impact assessments, PRIVACT
  statements, contracts, information sharing agreements, memoranda of
  understanding, and/or other documentation. Related Control(s): PT-2, PT-3,
  PT-5, PT-6.
