  Description:

  Provide feedback on organizational training results to the following personnel
  [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]: [Assignment:
  organization-defined personnel].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Training feedback includes awareness training results and role-based training
  results. Training results, especially failures of personnel in critical roles,
  can be indicative of a potentially serious problem. Therefore, it is important
  that senior managers are made aware of such situations so that they can take
  appropriate response actions. Training feedback supports the evaluation and
  update of organizational training described in AT-2b and AT-3b. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
