  Description:

  a. Provide role-based security and privacy training to personnel with the
  following roles and responsibilities: [Assignment: organization-defined roles
  and responsibilities]:

  1. Before authorizing access to the system, information, or performing
  assigned duties, and [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] thereafter;
  and

  2. When required by system changes;

  b. Update role-based training content [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency] and following [Assignment: organization-defined events]; and

  c. Incorporate lessons learned from internal or external security incidents or
  breaches into role-based training.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations determine the content of training based on the assigned roles
  and responsibilities of individuals as well as the security and privacy
  requirements of organizations and the systems to which personnel have
  authorized access, including technical training specifically tailored for
  assigned duties. Roles that may require role-based training include senior
  leaders or management officials (e.g., head of agency/chief executive officer,
  chief information officer, senior accountable official for risk management,
  senior agency information security officer, senior agency official for
  privacy), system owners; authorizing officials; system security officers;
  privacy officers; acquisition and procurement officials; enterprise
  architects; systems engineers; software developers; systems security
  engineers; privacy engineers; system, network, and database administrators;
  auditors; personnel conducting configuration management activities; personnel
  performing verification and validation activities; personnel with access to
  system-level software; control assessors; personnel with contingency planning
  and incident response duties; personnel with privacy management
  responsibilities; and personnel with access to personally identifiable
  information.


  Comprehensive role-based training addresses management, operational, and
  technical roles and responsibilities covering physical, personnel, and
  technical controls. Role-based training also includes policies, procedures,
  tools, methods, and artifacts for the security and privacy roles defined.
  Organizations provide the training necessary for individuals to fulfill their
  responsibilities related to operations and supply chain risk management within
  the context of organizational security and privacy programs. Role-based
  training also applies to contractors who provide services to federal agencies.
  Types of training include web-based and computer-based training,
  classroom-style training, and hands-on training (including micro-training).
  Updating role-based training on a regular basis helps to ensure that the
  content remains relevant and effective. Events that may precipitate an update
  to role-based training content include, but are not limited to, assessment or
  audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws,
  executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and
  guidelines. Related Control(s): AC-3, AC-17, AC-22, AT-2, AT-4, CP-3, IR-2,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System security plan; privacy plan; security and
  privacy awareness and training policy; procedures addressing security and
  privacy training implementation; codes of federal regulations; security and
  privacy training curriculum; security and privacy training materials; training
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  role-based security and privacy training; organizational personnel with
  assigned system security and privacy roles and responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms managing role-based security and privacy
  training].
