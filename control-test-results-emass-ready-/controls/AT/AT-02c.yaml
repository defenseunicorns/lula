  Description:

  a. Provide security and privacy literacy training to system users (including
  managers, senior executives, and contractors):

  1. As part of initial training for new users and [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] thereafter; and

  2. When required by system changes or following [Assignment:
  organization-defined events];

  b. Employ the following techniques to increase the security and privacy
  awareness of system users [Assignment: organization-defined awareness
  techniques];

  c. Update literacy training and awareness content [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment:
  organization-defined events]; and

  d. Incorporate lessons learned from internal or external security incidents or
  breaches into literacy training and awareness techniques.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations provide basic and advanced levels of literacy training to system
  users, including measures to test the knowledge level of users. Organizations
  determine the content of literacy training and awareness based on specific
  organizational requirements, the systems to which personnel have authorized
  access, and work environments (e.g., telework). The content includes an
  understanding of the need for security and privacy as well as actions by users
  to maintain security and personal privacy and to respond to suspected
  incidents. The content addresses the need for operations security and the
  handling of personally identifiable information.


  Awareness techniques include displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed
  with security and privacy reminders, displaying logon screen messages,
  generating email advisories or notices from organizational officials, and
  conducting awareness events. Literacy training after the initial training
  described in AT-2a.1 is conducted at a minimum frequency consistent with
  applicable laws, directives, regulations, and policies. Subsequent literacy
  training may be satisfied by one or more short ad hoc sessions and include
  topical information on recent attack schemes, changes to organizational
  security and privacy policies, revised security and privacy expectations, or a
  subset of topics from the initial training. Updating literacy training and
  awareness content on a regular basis helps to ensure that the content remains
  relevant. Events that may precipitate an update to literacy training and
  awareness content include, but are not limited to, assessment or audit
  findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws,
  executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and
  guidelines. Related Control(s): AC-3, AC-17, AC-22, AT-3, AT-4, CP-3, IA-4,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System security plan; privacy plan; literacy training
  and awareness policy; procedures addressing literacy training and awareness
  implementation; appropriate codes of federal regulations; security and privacy
  literacy training curriculum; security and privacy literacy training
  materials; training records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  literacy training and awareness; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities; organizational personnel comprising the
  general system user community].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms managing information security and privacy
  literacy training].
