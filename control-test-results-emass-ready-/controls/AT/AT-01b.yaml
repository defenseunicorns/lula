control-acronym: "[r5] AT-01"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop, document, and disseminate to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles]:

  1. [Selection (one or more): Organization-level; Mission/business
  process-level; System-level] awareness and training policy that:
    (a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
    (b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and
  2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the awareness and training
  policy and the associated awareness and training controls;

  b. Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the
  development, documentation, and dissemination of the awareness and training
  policy and procedures; and

  c. Review and update the current awareness and training:

  1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events]; and

  2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Awareness and training policy and procedures address the controls in the AT
  family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk
  management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and
  procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy
  assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs
  collaborate on the development of awareness and training policy and
  procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the
  organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for
  mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be
  included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented
  by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations.
  Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission
  or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the
  policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or
  role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in
  system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events
  that may precipitate an update to awareness and training policy and procedures
  include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or
  changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations,
  policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not
  constitute an organizational policy or procedure. Related Control(s): PM-9,
  PS-8, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System security plan; privacy plan; awareness and
  training policy and procedures; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with awareness and training
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities].
