control-acronym: "[r5] SC-05"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. [Selection: Protect against; Limit] the effects of the following types of
  denial-of-service events: [Assignment: organization-defined types of
  denial-of-service events]; and

  b. Employ the following controls to achieve the denial-of-service objective:
  [Assignment: organization-defined controls by type of denial-of-service
  event].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Denial-of-service events may occur due to a variety of internal and external
  causes, such as an attack by an adversary or a lack of planning to support
  organizational needs with respect to capacity and bandwidth. Such attacks can
  occur across a wide range of network protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). A variety
  of technologies are available to limit or eliminate the origination and
  effects of denial-of-service events. For example, boundary protection devices
  can filter certain types of packets to protect system components on internal
  networks from being directly affected by or the source of denial-of-service
  attacks. Employing increased network capacity and bandwidth combined with
  service redundancy also reduces the susceptibility to denial-of-service
  events. Related Control(s): CP-2, IR-4, SC-6, SC-7, SC-40.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing denial-of-service protection; system design documentation; list of
  denial-of-service attacks requiring employment of security safeguards to
  protect against or limit effects of such attacks; list of security safeguards
  protecting against or limiting the effects of denial-of-service attacks;
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit
  records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with incident response responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms protecting against or limiting the effects of
  denial-of-service attacks].
