control-acronym: "[r5] SC-07(04)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Implement a managed interface for each external telecommunication service;

  (b) Establish a traffic flow policy for each managed interface;

  (c) Protect the confidentiality and integrity of the information being
  transmitted across each interface;

  (d) Document each exception to the traffic flow policy with a supporting
  mission or business need and duration of that need;

  (e) Review exceptions to the traffic flow policy [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] and remove exceptions that are no longer
  supported by an explicit mission or business need;

  (f) Prevent unauthorized exchange of control plane traffic with external
  networks;

  (g) Publish information to enable remote networks to detect unauthorized
  control plane traffic from internal networks; and

  (h) Filter unauthorized control plane traffic from external networks.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  External telecommunications services can provide data and/or voice
  communications services. Examples of control plane traffic include Border
  Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing, Domain Name System (DNS), and management
  protocols. See SP 800-189 for additional information on the use of the
  resource public key infrastructure (RPKI) to protect BGP routes and detect
  unauthorized BGP announcements. Related Control(s): AC-3, SC-8, SC-20, SC-21,
  SC-22.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; traffic
  flow policy; information flow control policy; procedures addressing boundary
  protection; system security architecture; system design documentation;
  boundary protection hardware and software; system architecture and
  configuration documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; records of traffic flow policy exceptions; system audit
  records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for documenting and reviewing
  exceptions to the traffic flow policy; organizational processes for removing
  exceptions to the traffic flow policy; mechanisms implementing boundary
  protection capabilities; managed interfaces implementing traffic flow policy].

  organization-defined frequency for each external telecommunication service.;
  001107: Defines a frequency for the review of exceptions to the traffic flow

  flow policy exceptions that are no longer supported by an explicit mission or

  Determine if:

  - exceptions to the traffic flow policy are reviewed [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].

  - exceptions to the traffic flow policy that are no longer supported by an
  explicit mission or business need are removed.
