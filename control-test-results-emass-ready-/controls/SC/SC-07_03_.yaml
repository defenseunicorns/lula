  Description:

  Limit the number of external network connections to the system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Limiting the number of external network connections facilitates monitoring of
  inbound and outbound communications traffic. The Trusted Internet Connection
  DHS TIC initiative is an example of a federal guideline that requires limits
  on the number of external network connections. Limiting the number of external
  network connections to the system is  important during transition periods from
  older to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network
  protocols). Such transitions may require implementing the older and newer
  technologies simultaneously during the transition period and thus increase the
  number of access points to the system. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; system design documentation; boundary
  protection hardware and software; system architecture and configuration
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  communications and network traffic monitoring logs; system audit records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing boundary protection capabilities;
  mechanisms limiting the number of external network connections to the system].

test-results: UDS uses dedicated gateways and proxies as the only access points
  into the cluster. For example, the Istio ingress gateway is the only component
  listening for external requests; itâ€™s configured to allow only specific ports
  and protocols. There are no other open ports on the cluster nodes for UDS
  services unless declared. Management access (SSH/Kubernetes API) is similarly
  limited to admin interfaces. This single chokepoint design means the external
  exposure is minimal and well-defended
