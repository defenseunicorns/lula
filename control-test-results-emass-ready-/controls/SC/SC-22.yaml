control-information: >-
  Description:

  Ensure the systems that collectively provide name/address resolution service
  for an organization are fault-tolerant and implement internal and external
  role separation.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Systems that provide name and address resolution services include domain name
  system (DNS) servers. To eliminate single points of failure in systems and
  enhance redundancy, organizations employ at least two authoritative domain
  name system serversâ€”one configured as the primary server and the other
  configured as the secondary server. Additionally, organizations typically
  deploy the servers in two geographically separated network subnetworks (i.e.,
  not located in the same physical facility). For role separation, DNS servers
  with internal roles only process name and address resolution requests from
  within organizations (i.e., from internal clients). DNS servers with external
  roles only process name and address resolution information requests from
  clients external to organizations (i.e., on external networks, including the
  Internet). Organizations specify clients that can access authoritative DNS
  servers in certain roles (e.g., by address ranges and explicit lists). Related

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing architecture and provisioning for name/address resolution services;
  access control policy and procedures; system design documentation; assessment
  results from independent testing organizations; system configuration settings
  and associated documentation; system audit records; system security plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with responsibilities for managing DNS].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing name/address
  resolution services for fault tolerance and role separation].

  Determine if:

  - the systems that collectively provide name/address resolution services for
  an organization are fault-tolerant.

  - the systems that collectively provide name/address resolution services for
  an organization implement internal role separation. 

  - the systems that collectively provide name/address resolution services for
  an organization implement external role separation.
