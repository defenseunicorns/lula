control-information: >-
  Description:

  Verify that the acquisition, development, and use of mobile code to be
  deployed in the system meets [Assignment: organization-defined mobile code
  requirements].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  None. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing mobile code; mobile code requirements; mobile code usage
  restrictions; mobile code implementation policy and procedures; acquisition
  documentation; acquisition contracts for system, system component, or system
  service; system development life cycle documentation; system security plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with responsibilities for managing mobile code; organizational personnel with
  acquisition and contracting responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for the acquisition, development,
  and use of mobile code].


  Statement of Weakness:

  None

cci-definition: "001167: Verify that the development of mobile code to be
  deployed in information systems meets organization-defined mobile code
  requirements.; 001168: Defines mobile code requirements for the acquisition,
  development, and use of mobile code.; 001687: Verify that the use of mobile
  code deployed in system meets organization-defined mobile code requirements.;
  001688: Verify the acquisition of mobile code deployed in the system meets
  organization-defined mobile code requirements."
implementation-guidance: CCI-001168 of this assessment procedure is
  automatically compliant because of coverage by DoD Enterprise.
assessment-procedures: >-
  Determine if:

  - the acquisition of mobile code to be deployed in the system meets
  [Assignment: organization-defined mobile code requirements].

  - the development of mobile code to be deployed in the system meets
  [Assignment: organization-defined mobile code requirements].

  - the use of mobile code to be deployed in the system meets [Assignment:
  organization-defined mobile code requirements].

compliance-status: Not Applicable
test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS is primarily designed
  for secure application deployment and operations within Kubernetes clusters.
  It does not inherently utilize or permit execution of mobile code (such as
  Java applets, ActiveX controls, or scripts downloaded and executed directly by
  user endpoints). Any policies regarding acceptable or unacceptable mobile code
  technologies would be organizationally defined and enforced on client
  endpoints or application-specific components outside the UDS core platform.)
rev-4-migration-notes: "Automatically generated test result during Revision 5
  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: SC-18(2).1, SC-18(2).2, SC-18(2).3, SC-18(2).4. The resulting
  compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following Rev. 4
  assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance statement:
  SC-18(2).1, SC-18(2).2, SC-18(2).3, SC-18(2).4."
