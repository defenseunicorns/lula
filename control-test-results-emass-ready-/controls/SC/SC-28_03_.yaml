control-information: >-
  Description:

  Provide protected storage for cryptographic keys [Selection: [Assignment:
  organization-defined safeguards]; hardware-protected key store].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is an example of a hardware-protected data
  store that can be used to protect cryptographic keys. Related Control(s):
  SC-12, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing the protection of information at rest; system design documentation;
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; cryptographic
  mechanisms and associated configuration documentation; system audit records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing hardware-based
  key store protection].
