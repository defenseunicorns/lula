control-acronym: "[r5] SC-07(25)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Prohibit the direct connection of [Assignment: organization-defined
  unclassified national security system] to an external network without the use
  of [Assignment: organization-defined boundary protection device].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A direct connection is a dedicated physical or virtual connection between two
  or more systems. Organizations typically do not have complete control over
  external networks, including the Internet. Boundary protection devices (e.g.,
  firewalls, gateways, and routers) mediate communications and information flows
  between unclassified national security systems and external networks. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; system design documentation; system hardware
  and software; system architecture; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; system audit records; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms prohibiting the direct connection of
  unclassified national security systems to an external network].

  unclassified national security system to an external network without the use
  of organization-defined boundary protection device.; 004882: Defines the
  unclassified national security system that is prohibited from connecting to an
  external network without the use of organization-defined boundary protection
  device.; 004883: Defines the boundary protection device that prohibits the
  direct connection of organization-defined unclassified national security
  system to an external system."
implementation-guidance: CCI-004882 of this assessment procedure is
  automatically compliant because of coverage by DoD Enterprise.
assessment-procedures: "Determine if the direct connection of [Assignment:
  organization-defined unclassified national security system] to an external
  network without the use of [Assignment: organization-defined boundary
  protection device] is prohibited."

  security requirements: CCI-004881, CCI-004882, CCI-004883. The resulting
  compliance status was set to non-compliant because of the addition of a new
