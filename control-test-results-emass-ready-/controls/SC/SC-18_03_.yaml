control-information: >-
  Description:

  Prevent the download and execution of [Assignment: organization-defined
  unacceptable mobile code].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  None. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing mobile code; mobile code usage restrictions; mobile code
  implementation policy and procedures; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with responsibilities for managing mobile code].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms preventing the download and execution of
  unacceptable mobile code].


  Statement of Weakness:

  None

  unacceptable mobile code to prevent download and execution."
implementation-guidance: CCI-002459 of this assessment procedure is
  automatically compliant because of coverage by DoD Enterprise.

  Determine if:

  - the download of [Assignment: organization-defined unacceptable mobile code]
  is prevented.

  - the execution of [Assignment: organization-defined unacceptable mobile code]
  is prevented.

compliance-status: Not Applicable
test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS is primarily designed
  for secure application deployment and operations within Kubernetes clusters.
  It does not inherently utilize or permit execution of mobile code (such as
  Java applets, ActiveX controls, or scripts downloaded and executed directly by
  user endpoints). Any policies regarding acceptable or unacceptable mobile code
  technologies would be organizationally defined and enforced on client
  endpoints or application-specific components outside the UDS core platform.)
rev-4-migration-notes: "Automatically generated test result during Revision 5
  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: SC-18(3).1, SC-18(3).2, SC-18(3).3. The resulting compliance
  status was set to non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment
  procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance statement: SC-18(3).1,
  SC-18(3).2, SC-18(3).3."
