  Description:

  Implement [Assignment: organization-defined host-based boundary protection
  mechanisms] at [Assignment: organization-defined system components].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Host-based boundary protection mechanisms include host-based firewalls. System
  components that employ host-based boundary protection mechanisms include
  servers, workstations, notebook computers, and mobile devices. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; system design documentation; boundary
  protection hardware and software; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system audit records; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with boundary protection responsibilities; system users].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing host-based boundary protection
  capabilities].

  All UDS components that require a host-based boundary protection mechanisms
  are documented in the Security Assessment Plan (SAP) which identifies the test
  targets and test methods.

  UDS enforces host-based boundary protection mechanisms through its integrated
  container security solution (NeuVector) and Kubernetes-native policy
  enforcement (Pepr). NeuVector acts as a container-level firewall, providing
  real-time enforcement of network boundaries by blocking unauthorized network
  connections and detecting anomalous behavior within containers. Pepr policies
  further reinforce boundary protection by controlling Kubernetes resource
  definitions and ensuring that configurations align with organizational
  standards, preventing unauthorized or insecure container deployments.
  Additionally, the Istio service mesh ensures secure service-to-service
  communications via mutual TLS (mTLS), establishing strong internal boundaries
  and minimizing unauthorized lateral movement. Together, these components
  implement robust host-based boundary protections
