control-information: >-
  Description:

  Route [Assignment: organization-defined internal communications traffic] to
  [Assignment: organization-defined external networks] through authenticated
  proxy servers at managed interfaces.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  External networks are networks outside of organizational control. A proxy
  server is a server (i.e., system or application) that acts as an intermediary
  for clients requesting system resources from non-organizational or other
  organizational servers. System resources that may be requested include files,
  connections, web pages, or services. Client requests established through a
  connection to a proxy server are assessed to manage complexity and provide
  additional protection by limiting direct connectivity. Web content filtering
  devices are one of the most common proxy servers that provide access to the
  Internet. Proxy servers can support the logging of Transmission Control
  Protocol sessions and the blocking of specific Uniform Resource Locators,
  Internet Protocol addresses, and domain names. Web proxies can be configured
  with organization-defined lists of authorized and unauthorized websites. Note
  that proxy servers may inhibit the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) and
  create the potential for man-in-the-middle attacks (depending on the
  implementation). Related Control(s): AC-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; system design documentation; system hardware
  and software; system architecture; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; system audit records; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing traffic management through
  authenticated proxy servers at managed interfaces].
