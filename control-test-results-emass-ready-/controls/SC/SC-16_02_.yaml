control-acronym: "[r5] SC-16(02)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Implement anti-spoofing mechanisms to prevent adversaries from falsifying the
  security attributes indicating the successful application of the security
  process.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Some attack vectors operate by altering the security attributes of an
  information system to intentionally and maliciously implement an insufficient
  level of security within the system. The alteration of attributes leads
  organizations to believe that a greater number of security functions are in
  place and operational than have actually been implemented. Related Control(s):
  SI-3, SI-4, SI-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing the transmission of security and privacy attributes; access control
  policy and procedures; system design documentation; system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; system audit records; system security
  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing anti-spoofing
  mechanisms].
