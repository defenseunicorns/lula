control-acronym: "[r5] SC-18(04)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Prevent the automatic execution of mobile code in [Assignment:
  organization-defined software applications] and enforce [Assignment:
  organization-defined actions] prior to executing the code.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Actions enforced before executing mobile code include prompting users prior to
  opening email attachments or clicking on web links. Preventing the automatic
  execution of mobile code includes disabling auto-execute features on system
  components that employ portable storage devices, such as compact discs,
  digital versatile discs, and universal serial bus devices. Related Control(s):
  None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing mobile code; mobile code usage restrictions; mobile code
  implementation policy and procedures; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; list of software
  applications in which the automatic execution of mobile code must be
  prohibited; list of actions required before execution of mobile code; system
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with responsibilities for managing mobile code].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms preventing the automatic execution of
  unacceptable mobile code; mechanisms enforcing actions to be taken prior to
  the execution of the mobile code].

  organization-defined software applications.; 001171: Defines software
  applications in which automatic mobile code execution is to be prohibited.;

  Enforce organization-defined actions prior to executing mobile code."
implementation-guidance: CCI-001171 of this assessment procedure is
  automatically compliant because of coverage by DoD Enterprise.
assessment-procedures: >-
  Determine if:

  - the automatic execution of mobile code in [Assignment: organization-defined
  software applications] is prevented.

  - [Assignment: organization-defined actions] are enforced prior to executing
  mobile code.
inherited: Common Control Package
remote-inheritance-instance: "-"
compliance-status: Not Applicable
test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS is primarily designed
  for secure application deployment and operations within Kubernetes clusters.
  It does not inherently utilize or permit execution of mobile code (such as
  Java applets, ActiveX controls, or scripts downloaded and executed directly by
  user endpoints). Any policies regarding acceptable or unacceptable mobile code
  technologies would be organizationally defined and enforced on client
  endpoints or application-specific components outside the UDS core platform.)
rev-4-migration-notes: "Automatically generated test result during Revision 5
  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: SC-18(4).1, SC-18(4).2, SC-18(4).3, SC-18(4).4. The resulting
  compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following Rev. 4
  assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance statement:
  SC-18(4).1, SC-18(4).4."
