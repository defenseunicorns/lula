control-information: >-
  Description:

  Separate user functionality, including user interface services, from system
  management functionality.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  System management functionality includes functions that are necessary to
  administer databases, network components, workstations, or servers. These
  functions typically require privileged user access. The separation of user
  functions from system management functions is physical or logical.
  Organizations may separate system management functions from user functions by
  using different computers, instances of operating systems, central processing
  units, or network addresses; by employing virtualization techniques; or some
  combination of these or other methods. Separation of system management
  functions from user functions includes web administrative interfaces that
  employ separate authentication methods for users of any other system
  resources. Separation of system and user functions may include isolating
  administrative interfaces on different domains and with additional access
  controls. The separation of system and user functionality can be achieved by
  applying the systems security engineering design principles in SA-8, including
  SA-8(1), SA-8(3), SA-8(4), SA-8(10), SA-8(12), SA-8(13), SA-8(14), and
  SA-8(18). Related Control(s): AC-6, SA-4, SA-8, SC-3, SC-7, SC-22, SC-32,
  SC-39.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing application partitioning; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Separation of user functionality from system management
  functionality].

test-results: "UDS provides application partitioning through containerization
  and namespace separation. Each microservice in UDS runs in its own isolated
  container or pod, which the underlying OS and Kubernetes isolate from others
  (via separate process spaces, cgroups, etc.). Moreover, UDS can be configured
  with separate Kubernetes namespaces for different components (for example,
  security services vs. user applications). Communication between these
  partitions is controlled by Istio policies. This means that if one component
  is compromised, it cannot freely access others itâ€™s partitioned by design. For
  example, Keycloak runs separately from, say, the application it is protecting;
  it only communicates over defined network APIs, not via shared memory..
  Partitioning is further enhanced by RBAC: even if someone had access to manage
  an app, they can't directly affect the monitoring system, etc., because those
  are different components with separate privileges. UDS enforces strong
  boundaries between different subsystems. The provided architecture and data
  flow diagram provide a visual of the separation."
