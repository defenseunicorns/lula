  Description:

  Implement [Selection: physically; logically] separate subnetworks to isolate
  the following critical system components and functions: [Assignment:
  organization-defined critical system components and functions].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Separating critical system components and functions from other noncritical
  system components and functions through separate subnetworks may be necessary
  to reduce susceptibility to a catastrophic or debilitating breach or
  compromise that results in system failure. For example, physically separating
  the command and control function from the in-flight entertainment function
  through separate subnetworks in a commercial aircraft provides an increased
  level of assurance in the trustworthiness of critical system functions.
  Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; system design documentation; system hardware
  and software; system architecture; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; criticality analysis; system audit records; system
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms separating critical system components and
  functions].
