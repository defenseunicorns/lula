  Description:

  Synchronize system clocks within and between systems and system components.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Time synchronization of system clocks is essential for the correct execution
  of many system services, including identification and authentication processes
  that involve certificates and time-of-day restrictions as part of access
  control. Denial of service or failure to deny expired credentials may result
  without properly synchronized clocks within and between systems and system
  components. Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a
  modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset
  from UTC. The granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of
  synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks, such as clocks
  synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or tens of milliseconds.
  Organizations may define different time granularities for system components.
  Time service can be critical to other security capabilities—such as access
  control and identification and authentication—depending on the nature of the
  mechanisms used to support the capabilities. Related Control(s): AC-3, AU-8,
  IA-2, IA-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing time synchronization; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing system time
  synchronization].
