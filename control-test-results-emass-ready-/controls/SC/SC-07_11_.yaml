control-acronym: "[r5] SC-07(11)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Only allow incoming communications from [Assignment: organization-defined
  authorized sources] to be routed to [Assignment: organization-defined
  authorized destinations].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  General source address validation techniques are applied to restrict the use
  of illegal and unallocated source addresses as well as source addresses that
  should only be used within the system. The restriction of incoming
  communications traffic provides determinations that source and destination
  address pairs represent authorized or allowed communications. Determinations
  can be based on several factors, including the presence of such address pairs
  in the lists of authorized or allowed communications, the absence of such
  address pairs in lists of unauthorized or disallowed pairs, or meeting more
  general rules for authorized or allowed source and destination pairs. Strong
  authentication of network addresses is not possible without the use of
  explicit security protocols, and thus, addresses can often be spoofed.
  Further, identity-based incoming traffic restriction methods can be employed,
  including router access control lists and firewall rules. Related Control(s):
  AC-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing boundary protection capabilities
  with respect to source/destination address pairs].
