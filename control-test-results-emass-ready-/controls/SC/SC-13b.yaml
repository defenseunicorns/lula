control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Determine the [Assignment: organization-defined cryptographic uses]; and

  b. Implement the following types of cryptography required for each specified
  cryptographic use: [Assignment: organization-defined types of cryptography for
  each specified cryptographic use].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Cryptography can be employed to support a variety of security solutions,
  including the protection of classified information and controlled unclassified
  information, the provision and implementation of digital signatures, and the
  enforcement of information separation when authorized individuals have the
  necessary clearances but lack the necessary formal access approvals.
  Cryptography can also be used to support random number and hash generation.
  Generally applicable cryptographic standards include FIPS-validated
  cryptography and NSA-approved cryptography. For example, organizations that
  need to protect classified information may specify the use of NSA-approved
  cryptography. Organizations that need to provision and implement digital
  signatures may specify the use of FIPS-validated cryptography. Cryptography is
  implemented in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives,
  regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Related Control(s): AC-2,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing cryptographic protection; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; cryptographic module
  validation certificates; list of FIPS-validated cryptographic modules; system
  audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with responsibilities for cryptographic protection].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing cryptographic
  protection].
