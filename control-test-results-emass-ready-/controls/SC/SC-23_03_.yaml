control-acronym: "[r5] SC-23(03)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Generate a unique session identifier for each session with [Assignment:
  organization-defined randomness requirements] and recognize only session
  identifiers that are system-generated.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Generating unique session identifiers curtails the ability of adversaries to
  reuse previously valid session IDs. Employing the concept of randomness in the
  generation of unique session identifiers protects against brute-force attacks
  to determine future session identifiers. Related Control(s): AC-10, SC-12,
  SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing session authenticity; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting, implementing, generating, and
  monitoring unique session identifiers; mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing randomness requirements].

  UDS uses Keycloak for session management and authentication, generating unique
  and secure session identifiers in the form of cryptographically signed JSON
  Web Tokens (JWT). Keycloak employs industry-standard cryptographic libraries
  and secure randomness sources provided by the underlying operating system,
  ensuring session identifiers (tokens) meet stringent randomness and uniqueness
  requirements. The Istio Service Mesh generates unique cryptographic session
  identifiers (certificates) for each internal service-to-service session using
  secure random number generation compliant with best practices and DoD security
  standards.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Defining the appropriate level of
  randomness must be down at the organizational level.)

  UDS utilizes Keycloak for managing authentication sessions, which exclusively
  accepts session identifiers generated internally through its cryptographic
  mechanisms (JWT tokens and session cookies). Keycloak validates tokens and
  rejects any externally supplied or user-manipulated session identifiers that
  are not cryptographically verified.  Istio Service Mesh employs mutual TLS
  certificates issued internally through the embedded certificate authority
  (Citadel), strictly accepting only internally generated session credentials
  for secure inter-service communication.
