  Description:

  Verify the integrity of transmitted security and privacy attributes.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Part of verifying the integrity of transmitted information is ensuring that
  security and privacy attributes that are associated with such information have
  not been modified in an unauthorized manner. Unauthorized modification of
  security or privacy attributes can result in a loss of integrity for
  transmitted information. Related Control(s): AU-10, SC-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing the transmission of security and privacy attributes; access control
  policy and procedures; system design documentation; system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; system audit records; system security
  plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing verification of
  the integrity of transmitted security and privacy attributes].
