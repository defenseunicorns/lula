control-information: >-
  Description:

  Deny network communications traffic by default and allow network
  communications traffic by exception [Selection (one or more): at managed
  interfaces; for [Assignment: organization-defined systems]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Denying by default and allowing by exception applies to inbound and outbound
  network communications traffic. A deny-all, permit-by-exception network
  communications traffic policy ensures that only those system connections that
  are essential and approved are allowed. Deny by default, allow by exception
  also applies to a system that is connected to an external system. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing traffic management at managed
  interfaces].
