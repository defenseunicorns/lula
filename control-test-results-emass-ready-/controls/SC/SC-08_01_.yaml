control-information: >-
  Description:

  Implement cryptographic mechanisms to [Selection (one or more): prevent
  unauthorized disclosure of information; detect changes to information] during
  transmission.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Encryption protects information from unauthorized disclosure and modification
  during transmission. Cryptographic mechanisms that protect the confidentiality
  and integrity of information during transmission include TLS and IPSec.
  Cryptographic mechanisms used to protect information integrity include
  cryptographic hash functions that have applications in digital signatures,
  checksums, and message authentication codes. Related Control(s): SC-12, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing transmission confidentiality and integrity; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Cryptographic mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  transmission confidentiality and/or integrity; mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing alternative physical safeguards; organizational processes for
  defining and implementing alternative physical safeguards].

  The cryptographic mechanisms used (TLS 1.2+/AES) by UDS are industry-standard
  and can be configured to meet federal standards (e.g., using FIPS-validated
  algorithms if needed). Istioâ€™s mTLS and standard HTTPS both use protocols that
  provide end-to-end encryption and integrity. They are implemented via
  well-known libraries (OpenSSL, BoringSSL, etc.) which include proper cipher
  suites.
