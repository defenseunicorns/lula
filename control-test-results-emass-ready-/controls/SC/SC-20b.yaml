control-acronym: "[r5] SC-20"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Provide additional data origin authentication and integrity verification
  artifacts along with the authoritative name resolution data the system returns
  in response to external name/address resolution queries; and

  b. Provide the means to indicate the security status of child zones and (if
  the child supports secure resolution services) to enable verification of a
  chain of trust among parent and child domains, when operating as part of a
  distributed, hierarchical namespace.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Providing authoritative source information enables external clients, including
  remote Internet clients, to obtain origin authentication and integrity
  verification assurances for the host/service name to network address
  resolution information obtained through the service. Systems that provide name
  and address resolution services include domain name system (DNS) servers.
  Additional artifacts include DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) digital
  signatures and cryptographic keys. Authoritative data includes DNS resource
  records. The means for indicating the security status of child zones include
  the use of delegation signer resource records in the DNS. Systems that use
  technologies other than the DNS to map between host and service names and
  network addresses provide other means to assure the authenticity and integrity
  of response data. Related Control(s): AU-10, SC-8, SC-12, SC-13, SC-21, SC-22.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing secure name/address resolution services (authoritative source);
  system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with responsibilities for managing DNS].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing secure
  name/address resolution services].

  Determine if:

  - the means to indicate the security status of child zones (and if the child
  supports secure resolution services) is provided when operating as part of a
  distributed, hierarchical namespace.

  - the means to enable verification of a chain of trust among parent and child
  domains when operating as part of a distributed, hierarchical namespace is
  provided.
