control-acronym: "[r5] SC-28"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Protect the [Selection (one or more): confidentiality; integrity] of the
  following information at rest: [Assignment: organization-defined information
  at rest].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is not in
  process or in transit and is located on system components. Such components
  include internal or external hard disk drives, storage area network devices,
  or databases. However, the focus of protecting information at rest is not on
  the type of storage device or frequency of access but rather on the state of
  the information. Information at rest addresses the confidentiality and
  integrity of information and covers user information and system information.
  System-related information that requires protection includes configurations or
  rule sets for firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, filtering
  routers, and authentication information. Organizations may employ different
  mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, including the
  use of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Integrity protection
  can be achieved, for example, by implementing write-once-read-many (WORM)
  technologies. When adequate protection of information at rest cannot otherwise
  be achieved, organizations may employ other controls, including frequent
  scanning to identify malicious code at rest and secure offline storage in lieu
  of online storage. Related Control(s): AC-3, AC-4, AC-6, AC-19, CA-7, CM-3,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing the protection of information at rest; system design documentation;
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; cryptographic
  mechanisms and associated configuration documentation; list of information at
  rest requiring confidentiality and integrity protections; system security
  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing confidentiality
  and integrity protections for information at rest].

  rest that is to be protected."
implementation-guidance: CCI-002472 of this assessment procedure is
  automatically compliant because of coverage by DoD Enterprise.

  confidentiality; integrity] of [Assignment: organization-defined information
  at rest] is/are protected."
inherited: Local
remote-inheritance-instance: "-"
compliance-status: Compliant
test-results: UDS ensures protection of confidentiality and integrity of
  information at rest by employing industry-standard encryption practices.
  Specifically, data at rest, including persistent storage used by platform
  components like Keycloak, Grafana, Loki logs, and any Kubernetes persistent
  volumes, are encrypted using widely accepted, industry-standard cryptographic
  algorithms such as AES-256. Backups managed through Velero can be configured
  for encryption, ensuring data remains secure even when stored externally.

  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: SC-28.1, SC-28.2. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally
