control-acronym: "[r5] SC-23(05)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Only allow the use of [Assignment: organization-defined certificate
  authorities] for verification of the establishment of protected sessions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Reliance on certificate authorities for the establishment of secure sessions
  includes the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates. These
  certificates, after verification by their respective certificate authorities,
  facilitate the establishment of protected sessions between web clients and web
  servers. Related Control(s): SC-12, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing session authenticity; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; list of certificate
  authorities allowed for verification of the establishment of protected
  sessions; system audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the management
  of certificate authorities].

  UDS platform uses the Istio Service Mesh, which includes an internal
  certificate authority (Citadel) to manage mutual TLS (mTLS) certificates for
  internal service-to-service sessions. By default, Istioâ€™s built-in certificate
  authority generates certificates to securely verify internal communications.
  However, to fully align with this control organizations typically configure
  Istio to utilize certificates issued by an approved certificate authority
  compliant with DoDI 8520.02.
