control-acronym: "[r5] SC-07(09)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Detect and deny outgoing communications traffic posing a threat to
  external systems; and

  (b) Audit the identity of internal users associated with denied
  communications.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Detecting outgoing communications traffic from internal actions that may pose
  threats to external systems is known as extrusion detection. Extrusion
  detection is carried out within the system at managed interfaces. Extrusion
  detection includes the analysis of incoming and outgoing communications
  traffic while searching for indications of internal threats to the security of
  external systems. Internal threats to external systems include traffic
  indicative of denial-of-service attacks, traffic with spoofed source
  addresses, and traffic that contains malicious code. Organizations have
  criteria to determine, update, and manage identified threats related to
  extrusion detection. Related Control(s): AU-2, AU-6, SC-5, SC-38, SC-44, SI-3,
  SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; system design documentation; system hardware
  and software; system architecture; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; system audit records; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing boundary protection capabilities;
  mechanisms implementing the detection and denial of threatening outgoing
  communications traffic; mechanisms implementing auditing of outgoing
  communications traffic].
