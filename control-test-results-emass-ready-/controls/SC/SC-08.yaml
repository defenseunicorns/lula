  Description:

  Protect the [Selection (one or more): confidentiality; integrity] of
  transmitted information.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted information
  applies to internal and external networks as well as any system components
  that can transmit information, including servers, notebook computers, desktop
  computers, mobile devices, printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machines,
  and radios. Unprotected communication paths are exposed to the possibility of
  interception and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of
  information can be accomplished by physical or logical means. Physical
  protection can be achieved by using protected distribution systems. A
  protected distribution system is a wireline or fiber-optics telecommunications
  system that includes terminals and adequate electromagnetic, acoustical,
  electrical, and physical controls to permit its use for the unencrypted
  transmission of classified information. Logical protection can be achieved by
  employing encryption techniques.


  Organizations that rely on commercial providers who offer transmission
  services as commodity services rather than as fully dedicated services may
  find it difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the
  implementation of needed controls for transmission confidentiality and
  integrity. In such situations, organizations determine what types of
  confidentiality or integrity services are available in standard, commercial
  telecommunications service packages. If it is not feasible to obtain the
  necessary controls and assurances of control effectiveness through appropriate
  contracting vehicles, organizations can implement appropriate compensating
  controls. Related Control(s): AC-17, AC-18, AU-10, IA-3, IA-8, IA-9, MA-4,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing transmission confidentiality and integrity; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing transmission
  confidentiality and/or integrity].

test-results: UDS ensures the confidentiality and integrity of all data in
  transit using encryption. Istio mTLS by default encrypts service-to-service
  communication within the cluster​, meaning internal API calls or data
  exchanges are always over TLS (with modern ciphers), protecting them from
  eavesdropping or tampering. For data entering or leaving the cluster, UDS
  relies on TLS as well. The Istio Ingress gateway is usually configured with
  HTTPS (TLS) for incoming connections from users. Keycloak’s endpoints (for
  authentication) are accessed via HTTPS. If the cluster calls out to an
  external API, the recommendation and typical setup is to use TLS for those
  calls too (and Istio can enforce TLS origination if needed).
