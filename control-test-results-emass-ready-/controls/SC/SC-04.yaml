control-acronym: "[r5] SC-04"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system
  resources.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Preventing unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system
  resources stops information produced by the actions of prior users or roles
  (or the actions of processes acting on behalf of prior users or roles) from
  being available to current users or roles (or current processes acting on
  behalf of current users or roles) that obtain access to shared system
  resources after those resources have been released back to the system.
  Information in shared system resources also applies to encrypted
  representations of information. In other contexts, control of information in
  shared system resources is referred to as object reuse and residual
  information protection. Information in shared system resources does not
  address information remanence, which refers to the residual representation of
  data that has been nominally deleted; covert channels (including storage and
  timing channels), where shared system resources are manipulated to violate
  information flow restrictions; or components within systems for which there
  are only single users or roles. Related Control(s): AC-3, AC-4, SA-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing information protection in shared system resources; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms preventing the unauthorized and unintended
  transfer of information via shared system resources].

test-results: UDS platform implements robust isolation and resource management
  measures to prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via
  shared system resources. Specifically, UDS utilizes Kubernetes namespace
  isolation combined with network policies enforced by Istio Service Mesh,
  ensuring strict segregation and controlled communication between containerized
  applications and microservices. Additionally, NeuVector continuously monitors
  container runtime behavior, network traffic, and system processes, proactively
  blocking unauthorized cross-container interactions or access to shared
  resources. Resource usage and activity monitoring are further supported by
  Prometheus and Grafana, enabling detection of anomalous or unauthorized
  resource consumption patterns. Collectively, these integrated mechanisms
  provide effective controls to mitigate the risk of unauthorized or unintended
  information transfer within shared system environments.
