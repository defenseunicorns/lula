control-acronym: "[r5] SC-07(13)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Isolate [Assignment: organization-defined information security tools,
  mechanisms, and support components] from other internal system components by
  implementing physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces to other
  components of the system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces are useful in
  isolating computer network defenses from critical operational processing
  networks to prevent adversaries from discovering the analysis and forensics
  techniques employed by organizations. Related Control(s): SC-2, SC-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; system design documentation; system hardware
  and software; system architecture; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; list of security tools and support components to be
  isolated from other internal system components; system audit records; system
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the isolation of
  information security tools, mechanisms, and support components].

  In UDS, isolation of security tools and support components is achieved by
  deploying them into dedicated environments using separate Kubernetes
  namespaces and, where the underlying infrastructure permits, physically
  separate subnetworks with controlled interfaces. Critical security services
  like Keycloak, NeuVector, and the Istio control plane are isolated from
  general application workloads through strict network segmentation and managed
  access points, ensuring that communications between these components and other
  system elements occur only through predefined, secure channels. This approach
  is enforced via Infrastructure as Code (using OpenTofu and Zarf), which
  codifies and consistently deploys these boundaries, thereby reducing the
  attack surface and safeguarding the integrity of the organizationâ€™s core
  security functions.

  The organization being inspected/assessed is automatically compliant with this
  CCI because they are covered at the DoD level. DoD has defined the key
  information security tools, mechanisms, and support components as key
  information security tools, mechanisms, and support components such as, but
  not limited to PKI, Patching infrastructure, HBSS, CND Tools, Special Purpose
  Gateway, vulnerability tracking systems, honeypots, internet access points
  (IAPs); network element and data center administrative/management traffic;
  Demilitarized Zones (DMZs), Server farms/computing centers, centralized audit
  log servers etc.
