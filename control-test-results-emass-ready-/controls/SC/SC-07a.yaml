control-acronym: "[r5] SC-07"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Monitor and control communications at the external managed interfaces to
  the system and at key internal managed interfaces within the system;

  b. Implement subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are
  [Selection: physically; logically] separated from internal organizational
  networks; and

  c. Connect to external networks or systems only through managed interfaces
  consisting of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an
  organizational security and privacy architecture.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Managed interfaces include gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, network-based
  malicious code analysis, virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels
  implemented within a security architecture. Subnetworks that are physically or
  logically separated from internal networks are referred to as demilitarized
  zones or DMZs. Restricting or prohibiting interfaces within organizational
  systems includes restricting external web traffic to designated web servers
  within managed interfaces, prohibiting external traffic that appears to be
  spoofing internal addresses, and prohibiting internal traffic that appears to
  be spoofing external addresses. SP 800-189 provides additional information on
  source address validation techniques to prevent ingress and egress of traffic
  with spoofed addresses. Commercial telecommunications services are provided by
  network components and consolidated management systems shared by customers.
  These services may also include third party-provided access lines and other
  service elements. Such services may represent sources of increased risk
  despite contract security provisions. Boundary protection may be implemented
  as a common control for all or part of an organizational network such that the
  boundary to be protected is greater than a system-specific boundary (i.e., an
  authorization boundary). Related Control(s): AC-4, AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, AC-20,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; list of key internal boundaries of the system;
  system design documentation; boundary protection hardware and software; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; enterprise security
  architecture documentation; system audit records; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing boundary protection capabilities].

  - communications at external managed interfaces to the system are controlled.

  - communications at key internal managed interfaces within the system are
  monitored.

  - communications at key internal managed interfaces within the system are
  controlled.
