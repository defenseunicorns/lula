  Description:

  Protect against unauthorized physical connections at [Assignment:
  organization-defined managed interfaces].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Systems that operate at different security categories or classification levels
  may share common physical and environmental controls, since the systems may
  share space within the same facilities. In practice, it is possible that these
  separate systems may share common equipment rooms, wiring closets, and cable
  distribution paths. Protection against unauthorized physical connections can
  be achieved by using clearly identified and physically separated cable trays,
  connection frames, and patch panels for each side of managed interfaces with
  physical access controls that enforce limited authorized access to these
  items. Related Control(s): PE-4, PE-19.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; system design documentation; system hardware
  and software; system architecture; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; facility communications and wiring diagram system
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing protection
  against unauthorized physical connections].

  In UDS, while the platform is primarily container-based and deployed in
  virtualized environments, protection against unauthorized physical connections
  is achieved by leveraging the security controls of the underlying
  infrastructure. Managed interfaces such as those for Kubernetes, Istio
  ingress/egress, and host nodes deployed on physically isolated or logically
  segmented subnetworks, where physical access is strictly controlled by data
  center or cloud provider policies. The use of Infrastructure as Code via
  OpenTofu and secure deployment packaging with Zarf ensures that these network
  interfaces are consistently configured in environments with hardened physical
  and network security measures (e.g., firewalls and access control lists),
  thereby minimizing the risk of unauthorized physical connections.

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.
