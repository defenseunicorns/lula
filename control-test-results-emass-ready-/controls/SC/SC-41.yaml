control-acronym: "[r5] SC-41"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  [Selection: Physically; Logically] disable or remove [Assignment:
  organization-defined connection ports or input/output devices] on the
  following systems or system components: [Assignment: organization-defined
  systems or system components].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Connection ports include Universal Serial Bus (USB), Thunderbolt, and Firewire
  (IEEE 1394). Input/output (I/O) devices include compact disc and digital
  versatile disc drives. Disabling or removing such connection ports and I/O
  devices helps prevent the exfiltration of information from systems and the
  introduction of malicious code from those ports or devices. Physically
  disabling or removing ports and/or devices is the stronger action. Related
  Control(s): AC-20, MP-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; access
  control policy and procedures; procedures addressing port and input/output
  device access; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; system architecture; systems or system components;
  list of connection ports or input/output devices to be physically disabled or
  removed on systems or system components; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the disabling of
  connection ports or input/output devices].
