  Description:

  (a) Prevent the exfiltration of information; and

  (b) Conduct exfiltration tests [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Prevention of exfiltration applies to both the intentional and unintentional
  exfiltration of information. Techniques used to prevent the exfiltration of
  information from systems may be implemented at internal endpoints, external
  boundaries, and across managed interfaces and include adherence to protocol
  formats, monitoring for beaconing activity from systems, disconnecting
  external network interfaces except when explicitly needed, employing traffic
  profile analysis to detect deviations from the volume and types of traffic
  expected, call backs to command and control centers, conducting penetration
  testing, monitoring for steganography, disassembling and reassembling packet
  headers, and using data loss and data leakage prevention tools. Devices that
  enforce strict adherence to protocol formats include deep packet inspection
  firewalls and Extensible Markup Language (XML) gateways. The devices verify
  adherence to protocol formats and specifications at the application layer and
  identify vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices that operate at
  the network or transport layers. The prevention of exfiltration is similar to
  data loss prevention or data leakage prevention and is closely associated with
  cross-domain solutions and system guards that enforce information flow
  requirements. Related Control(s): AC-2, CA-8, SI-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing boundary protection capabilities
  that prevent the unauthorized exfiltration of information across managed
  interfaces].
