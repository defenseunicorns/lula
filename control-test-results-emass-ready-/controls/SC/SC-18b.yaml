control-acronym: "[r5] SC-18"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Define acceptable and unacceptable mobile code and mobile code
  technologies; and

  b. Authorize, monitor, and control the use of mobile code within the system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Mobile code includes any program, application, or content that can be
  transmitted across a network (e.g., embedded in an email, document, or
  website) and executed on a remote system. Decisions regarding the use of
  mobile code within organizational systems are based on the potential for the
  code to cause damage to the systems if used maliciously. Mobile code
  technologies include Java applets, JavaScript, HTML5, WebGL, and VBScript.
  Usage restrictions and implementation guidelines apply to both the selection
  and use of mobile code installed on servers and mobile code downloaded and
  executed on individual workstations and devices, including notebook computers
  and smart phones. Mobile code policy and procedures address specific actions
  taken to prevent the development, acquisition, and introduction of
  unacceptable mobile code within organizational systems, including requiring
  mobile code to be digitally signed by a trusted source. Related Control(s):
  AU-2, AU-12, CM-2, CM-6, SI-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing mobile code; mobile code implementation policy and procedures; list
  of acceptable mobile code and mobile code technologies; list of unacceptable
  mobile code and mobile technologies; authorization records; system monitoring
  records; system audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with responsibilities for managing mobile code].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational process for authorizing, monitoring, and
  controlling mobile code; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the
  management of mobile code; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the
  monitoring of mobile code].

compliance-status: Not Applicable
test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS is primarily designed
  for secure application deployment and operations within Kubernetes clusters.
  It does not inherently utilize or permit execution of mobile code (such as
  Java applets, ActiveX controls, or scripts downloaded and executed directly by
  user endpoints). Any policies regarding acceptable or unacceptable mobile code
  technologies would be organizationally defined and enforced on client
  endpoints or application-specific components outside the UDS core platform.)
rev-4-migration-notes: "Automatically generated test result during Revision 5
  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: SC-18.4, SC-18.5, SC-18.6. The resulting compliance status was set
  to non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no
  locally entered test result/compliance statement: SC-18.4, SC-18.5, SC-18.6."
