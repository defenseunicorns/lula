control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Compare the internal system clocks [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency] with [Assignment: organization-defined authoritative time source];
  and

  (b) Synchronize the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source
  when the time difference is greater than [Assignment: organization-defined
  time period].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Synchronization of internal system clocks with an authoritative source
  provides uniformity of time stamps for systems with multiple system clocks and
  systems connected over a network. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing time synchronization; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing system time
  synchronization].

cci-definition: "004923: Compare the internal system clocks on an
  organization-defined frequency with organization-defined authoritative time
  source.; 004924: Defines the frequency for comparing the internal system
  clocks with organization-defined authoritative time source.; 004925: Defines
  the time source used for comparing the internal system clocks."
implementation-guidance: CCI-004924 of this assessment procedure is
  automatically compliant because of coverage by DoD Enterprise.

  [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] with [Assignment:
  organization-defined authoritative time source]."

compliance-status: Compliant
test-results: UDS ensures precise synchronization of internal system clocks
  through Kubernetes infrastructure, which is configured to regularly
  synchronize with an authoritative time source using the Network Time Protocol
  (NTP). Kubernetes nodes, containers, and all associated UDS components
  maintain time synchronization by periodically (at intervals defined by the
  organization's policy) comparing and aligning their internal clocks with the
  organization's designated authoritative NTP servers. This synchronization
  ensures consistent and accurate timestamps across audit logs collected by
  Vector and stored in Loki, facilitating accurate event correlation and
  compliance auditing.
rev-4-migration-notes: "Automatically generated test result during Revision 5
  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: AU-8(1).1, AU-8(1).2, AU-8(1).3; as well as the following Rev. 5
  security requirements: CCI-004923, CCI-004924, CCI-004925. The resulting
  compliance status was set to non-compliant because of the addition of a new
  security requirement to the assessment procedure that has not been previously
  assessed: CCI-004923, CCI-004924, CCI-004925."
