control-acronym: "[r5] SC-18(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Identify [Assignment: organization-defined unacceptable mobile code] and take
  [Assignment: organization-defined corrective actions].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Corrective actions when unacceptable mobile code is detected include blocking,
  quarantine, or alerting administrators. Blocking includes preventing the
  transmission of word processing files with embedded macros when such macros
  have been determined to be unacceptable mobile code. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing mobile code; mobile code usage restrictions; mobile code
  implementation policy and procedures; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; list of unacceptable
  mobile code; list of corrective actions to be taken when unacceptable mobile
  code is identified; system monitoring records; system audit records; system
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with responsibilities for managing mobile code].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing mobile code
  detection, inspection, and corrective capabilities].

  Determine if:

  - [Assignment: organization-defined unacceptable mobile code] is identified.

  - [Assignment: organization-defined corrective actions] are taken if
  unacceptable mobile code is identified.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS is primarily designed for secure
  application deployment and operations within Kubernetes clusters. It does not
  inherently utilize or permit execution of mobile code (such as Java applets,
  ActiveX controls, or scripts downloaded and executed directly by user
  endpoints). Any policies regarding acceptable or unacceptable mobile code
  technologies would be organizationally defined and enforced on client
  endpoints or application-specific components outside the UDS core platform.)

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.
rev-4-migration-notes: "Automatically generated test result during Revision 5
  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: SC-18(1).1, SC-18(1).2, SC-18(1).3, SC-18(1).4. The resulting
  compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following Rev. 4
  assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance statement:
  SC-18(1).1, SC-18(1).2, SC-18(1).4."
