control-acronym: "[r5] SC-05(02)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Manage capacity, bandwidth, or other redundancy to limit the effects of
  information flooding denial-of-service attacks.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Managing capacity ensures that sufficient capacity is available to counter
  flooding attacks. Managing capacity includes establishing selected usage
  priorities, quotas, partitioning, or load balancing. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing denial-of-service protection; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with incident response responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing the management of system
  bandwidth, capacity, and redundancy to limit the effects of information
  flooding denial-of-service attacks].
