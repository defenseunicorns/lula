control-acronym: "[r5] SC-21"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Request and perform data origin authentication and data integrity verification
  on the name/address resolution responses the system receives from
  authoritative sources.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Each client of name resolution services either performs this validation on its
  own or has authenticated channels to trusted validation providers. Systems
  that provide name and address resolution services for local clients include
  recursive resolving or caching domain name system (DNS) servers. DNS client
  resolvers either perform validation of DNSSEC signatures, or clients use
  authenticated channels to recursive resolvers that perform such validations.
  Systems that use technologies other than the DNS to map between host and
  service names and network addresses provide some other means to enable clients
  to verify the authenticity and integrity of response data. Related Control(s):
  SC-20, SC-22.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing secure name/address resolution services (recursive or caching
  resolver); system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; system audit records; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with responsibilities for managing DNS].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing data origin
  authentication and data integrity verification for name/address resolution
  services].

  Determine if:

  - data origin authentication is requested for the name/address resolution
  responses that the system receives from authoritative sources.

  - data origin authentication is performed on the name/address resolution
  responses that the system receives from authoritative sources.

  - data integrity verification is requested for the name/address resolution
  responses that the system receives from authoritative sources.

  - data integrity verification is performed on the name/address resolution
  responses that the system receives from authoritative sources.
