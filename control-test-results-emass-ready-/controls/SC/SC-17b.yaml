control-acronym: "[r5] SC-17"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Issue public key certificates under an [Assignment: organization-defined
  certificate policy] or obtain public key certificates from an approved service
  provider; and

  b. Include only approved trust anchors in trust stores or certificate stores
  managed by the organization.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates are certificates with visibility
  external to organizational systems and certificates related to the internal
  operations of systems, such as application-specific time services. In
  cryptographic systems with a hierarchical structure, a trust anchor is an
  authoritative source (i.e., a certificate authority) for which trust is
  assumed and not derived. A root certificate for a PKI system is an example of
  a trust anchor. A trust store or certificate store maintains a list of trusted
  root certificates. Related Control(s): AU-10, IA-5, SC-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing public key infrastructure certificates; public key certificate
  policy or policies; public key issuing process; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with responsibilities for issuing public key certificates; service providers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the management
  of public key infrastructure certificates].
