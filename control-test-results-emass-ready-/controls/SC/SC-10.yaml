control-information: >-
  Description:

  Terminate the network connection associated with a communications session at
  the end of the session or after [Assignment: organization-defined time period]
  of inactivity.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Network disconnect applies to internal and external networks. Terminating
  network connections associated with specific communications sessions includes
  de-allocating TCP/IP address or port pairs at the operating system level and
  de-allocating the networking assignments at the application level if multiple
  application sessions are using a single operating system-level network
  connection. Periods of inactivity may be established by organizations and
  include time periods by type of network access or for specific network
  accesses. Related Control(s): AC-17, SC-23.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing network disconnect; system design documentation; security plan;
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit
  records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing a network
  disconnect capability].

  UDS leverages centralized authentication provided by Keycloak, integrated with
  AuthService, to enforce session timeouts and inactivity thresholds. Keycloak
  supports configurable idle and maximum session durations, automatically
  terminating user sessions upon logout, session expiration, or after a defined
  period of inactivity. Istio Service Mesh enforces network connection timeouts
  and idle connection management between services, automatically closing
  inactive network connections based on configurable policies. These mechanisms
  together ensure that both user and internal network sessions are terminated
  securely at the end of sessions or after defined inactivity periods.

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.
