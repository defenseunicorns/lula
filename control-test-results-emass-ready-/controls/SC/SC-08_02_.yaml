  Description:

  Maintain the [Selection (one or more): confidentiality; integrity] of
  information during preparation for transmission and during reception.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information can be unintentionally or maliciously disclosed or modified during
  preparation for transmission or during reception, including during
  aggregation, at protocol transformation points, and during packing and
  unpacking. Such unauthorized disclosures or modifications compromise the
  confidentiality or integrity of the information. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing transmission confidentiality and integrity; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing transmission
  confidentiality and/or integrity].

  UDS system maintains confidentiality and integrity during preparation for
  transmission through a multi-layered security approach. Data is first packaged
  using Zarf, which applies cryptographic signing and hashing to ensure that
  packages are not altered, thereby preserving data integrity. Before
  transmission, Istio enforces mutual TLS (mTLS) for all inter-service
  communications and HTTPS for external access, ensuring that data is encrypted
  and authenticated end-to-end. Additionally, Keycloak and AuthService control
  access to the data preparation process, so only authorized users can trigger
  transmissions.

  UDS system employs a multi-layered approach to ensure that information remains
  confidential and unaltered during reception. Data arriving through controlled
  ingress points such as the Istio Ingress Gateway is transmitted over
  TLS-encrypted channels, preventing interception and maintaining
  confidentiality. Upon receipt, cryptographic checks (including digital
  signature validation and checksum verification) confirm the data's integrity,
  ensuring it has not been tampered with in transit. Keycloak and AuthService
  work together to verify the identity of the sender.
