  Description:

  Prevent split tunneling for remote devices connecting to organizational
  systems unless the split tunnel is securely provisioned using [Assignment:
  organization-defined safeguards].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Split tunneling is the process of allowing a remote user or device to
  establish a non-remote connection with a system and simultaneously communicate
  via some other connection to a resource in an external network. This method of
  network access enables a user to access remote devices and simultaneously,
  access uncontrolled networks. Split tunneling might be desirable by remote
  users to communicate with local system resources, such as printers or file
  servers. However, split tunneling can facilitate unauthorized external
  connections, making the system vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of
  organizational information. Split tunneling can be prevented by disabling
  configuration settings that allow such capability in remote devices and by
  preventing those configuration settings from being configurable by users.
  Prevention can also be achieved by the detection of split tunneling (or of
  configuration settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device, and
  by prohibiting the connection if the remote device is using split tunneling. A
  virtual private network (VPN) can be used to securely provision a split
  tunnel. A securely provisioned VPN includes locking connectivity to exclusive,
  managed, and named environments, or to a specific set of pre-approved
  addresses, without user control. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; system design documentation; system hardware
  and software; system architecture; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; system audit records; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing boundary protection capabilities;
  mechanisms supporting/restricting non-remote connections].

compliance-status: Need Review
test-results: In the context of UDS, the system itself doesn’t directly control
  a remote device’s network interfaces; however, it enforces secure remote
  access by ensuring that all connections use designated secure channels
  primarily through Istio’s Ingress/Egress Gateways with mutual TLS and strict
  network policies which effectively prevents a remote device from
  simultaneously establishing an unsecured or non-remote connection to external
  resources. To fully meet the control’s intent, endpoint configurations (such
  as VPN clients configured to disable split tunneling) and organizational
  policies must be applied to the remote device so that when connected to UDS,
  no alternate connection can be used to bypass security controls.

  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: SC-7(7).1; as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements:
  CCI-004873. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  of the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that
