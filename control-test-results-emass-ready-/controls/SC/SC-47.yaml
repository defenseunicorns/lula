control-acronym: "[r5] SC-47"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Establish [Assignment: organization-defined alternate communications paths]
  for system operations organizational command and control.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  An incident, whether adversarial- or nonadversarial-based, can disrupt
  established communications paths used for system operations and organizational
  command and control. Alternate communications paths reduce the risk of all
  communications paths being affected by the same incident. To compound the
  problem, the inability of organizational officials to obtain timely
  information about disruptions or to provide timely direction to operational
  elements after a communications path incident, can impact the ability of the
  organization to respond to such incidents in a timely manner. Establishing
  alternate communications paths for command and control purposes, including
  designating alternative decision makers if primary decision makers are
  unavailable and establishing the extent and limitations of their actions, can
  greatly facilitate the organizationâ€™s ability to continue to operate and take
  appropriate actions during an incident. Related Control(s): CP-2, CP-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing communication paths; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing alternate
  communication paths for system operations].
