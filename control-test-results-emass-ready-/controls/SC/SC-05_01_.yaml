control-acronym: "[r5] SC-05(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Restrict the ability of individuals to launch the following denial-of-service
  attacks against other systems: [Assignment: organization-defined
  denial-of-service attacks].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Restricting the ability of individuals to launch denial-of-service attacks
  requires the mechanisms commonly used for such attacks to be unavailable.
  Individuals of concern include hostile insiders or external adversaries who
  have breached or compromised the system and are using it to launch a
  denial-of-service attack. Organizations can restrict the ability of
  individuals to connect and transmit arbitrary information on the transport
  medium (i.e., wired networks, wireless networks, spoofed Internet protocol
  packets). Organizations can also limit the ability of individuals to use
  excessive system resources. Protection against individuals having the ability
  to launch denial-of-service attacks may be implemented on specific systems or
  boundary devices that prohibit egress to potential target systems. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing denial-of-service protection; system design documentation; list of
  denial-of-service attacks launched by individuals against systems; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with incident response responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms restricting the ability to launch
  denial-of-service attacks against other systems].
