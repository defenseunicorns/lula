control-acronym: "[r5] SC-23(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Invalidate session identifiers upon user logout or other session termination.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Invalidating session identifiers at logout curtails the ability of adversaries
  to capture and continue to employ previously valid session IDs. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing session authenticity; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing session
  identifier invalidation upon session termination].

test-results: UDS leverages Keycloak, integrated with AuthService, to manage
  user sessions securely. Keycloak automatically invalidates session identifiers
  upon explicit user logout, session timeout, or administrator-initiated
  termination of sessions. Upon invalidation, JWT tokens and associated session
  cookies become unusable, effectively preventing reuse or replay attacks. The
  Istio Service Mesh enforces token validation on each request, ensuring that
  terminated or invalidated sessions cannot access system resources after
  termination.
