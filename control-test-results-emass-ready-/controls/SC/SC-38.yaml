control-information: >-
  Description:

  Employ the following operations security controls to protect key
  organizational information throughout the system development life cycle:
  [Assignment: organization-defined operations security controls].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Operations security (OPSEC) is a systematic process by which potential
  adversaries can be denied information about the capabilities and intentions of
  organizations by identifying, controlling, and protecting generally
  unclassified information that specifically relates to the planning and
  execution of sensitive organizational activities. The OPSEC process involves
  five steps: identification of critical information, analysis of threats,
  analysis of vulnerabilities, assessment of risks, and the application of
  appropriate countermeasures. OPSEC controls are applied to organizational
  systems and the environments in which those systems operate. OPSEC controls
  protect the confidentiality of information, including limiting the sharing of
  information with suppliers, potential suppliers, and other non-organizational
  elements and individuals. Information critical to organizational mission and
  business functions includes user identities, element uses, suppliers, supply
  chain processes, functional requirements, security requirements, system design
  specifications, testing and evaluation protocols, and security control
  implementation details. Related Control(s): CA-2, CA-7, PL-1, PM-9, PM-12,
  RA-2, RA-3, RA-5, SC-7, SR-3, SR-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing operations security; security plan; list of operations security
  safeguards; security control assessments; risk assessments; threat and
  vulnerability assessments; plans of action and milestones; system development
  life cycle documentation; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system; system
  developers/integrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for protecting organizational
  information throughout the system development life cycle; mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing safeguards to protect organizational
  information throughout the system development life cycle].

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (These controls pertain to
  organizational policies, procedures, and processes implemented throughout the
  system development life cycle (SDLC), rather than specific technical
  safeguards provided by the UDS platform itself. While UDS facilitates secure
  development through secure components and best practices (such as IaC, secure
  deployment with Zarf, and integrated security tools like NeuVector), defining
  and employing operational security (OPSEC) safeguards during the development
  lifecycle (e.g., personnel procedures, secure coding practices, information
  handling policies) remains an organizational responsibility. UDS provides a
  secure deployment and operational foundation, but actual OPSEC safeguards must
  be defined, implemented, and documented at the organizational policy and
  procedural level outside the UDS core platform.

  procedures: SC-38.1, SC-38.2. The resulting compliance status was set to
