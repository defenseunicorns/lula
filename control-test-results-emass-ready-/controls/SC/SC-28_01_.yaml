  Description:

  Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and
  modification of the following information at rest on [Assignment:
  organization-defined system components or media]: [Assignment:
  organization-defined information].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect the
  confidentiality and integrity of organizational information. The strength of
  mechanism is commensurate with the security category or classification of the
  information. Organizations have the flexibility to encrypt information on
  system components or media or encrypt data structures, including files,
  records, or fields. Related Control(s): AC-19, SC-12, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing the protection of information at rest; system design documentation;
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; cryptographic
  mechanisms and associated configuration documentation; system audit records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Cryptographic mechanisms implementing confidentiality and
  integrity protections for information at rest].

  Determine if:

  - cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to prevent unauthorized disclosure
  of [Assignment: organization-defined information] at rest on [Assignment:
  organization-defined system components or media].

  - cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to prevent unauthorized
  modification of [Assignment: organization-defined information] at rest on
  [Assignment: organization-defined system components or media].

test-results: UDS ensures protection of confidentiality and integrity of
  information at rest by employing industry-standard encryption practices.
  Specifically, data at rest, including persistent storage used by platform
  components like Keycloak, Grafana, Loki logs, and any Kubernetes persistent
  volumes, are encrypted using widely accepted, industry-standard cryptographic
  algorithms such as AES-256. Backups managed through Velero can be configured
  for encryption, ensuring data remains secure even when stored externally. In
  UDS, cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to secure sensitive information
  at rest on designated system components, preventing unauthorized disclosure in
  line with organization-defined policies. For instance, Kubernetes Secrets
  storing credentials and certificates—are encrypted at rest using etcd
  encryption and protected with strict RBAC controls, while persistent storage
  volumes can be configured with industry-standard encryption algorithms such as
  AES-256. Velero backups can be stored on encrypted media, and Zarf’s packaging
  process employs cryptographic signing to ensure the integrity and authenticity
  of software components. This layered approach, which also extends to log
  storage and other data repositories, leverages approved cryptographic
  standards to maintain confidentiality across the entire UDS environment.
