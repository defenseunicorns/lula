control-acronym: "[r5] SC-16"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Associate [Assignment: organization-defined security and privacy attributes]
  with information exchanged between systems and between system components.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Security and privacy attributes can be explicitly or implicitly associated
  with the information contained in organizational systems or system components.
  Attributes are abstractions that represent the basic properties or
  characteristics of an entity with respect to protecting information or the
  management of personally identifiable information. Attributes are typically
  associated with internal data structures, including records, buffers, and
  files within the system. Security and privacy attributes are used to implement
  access control and information flow control policies; reflect special
  dissemination, management, or distribution instructions, including permitted
  uses of personally identifiable information; or support other aspects of the
  information security and privacy policies. Privacy attributes may be used
  independently or in conjunction with security attributes. Related Control(s):
  AC-3, AC-4, AC-16.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing the transmission of security and privacy attributes; access control
  policy and procedures; information flow control policy; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system audit records; system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the transmission
  of security and privacy attributes between systems].
