  Description:

  Maintain a separate execution domain for each executing system process.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Systems can maintain separate execution domains for each executing process by
  assigning each process a separate address space. Each system process has a
  distinct address space so that communication between processes is performed in
  a manner controlled through the security functions, and one process cannot
  modify the executing code of another process. Maintaining separate execution
  domains for executing processes can be achieved, for example, by implementing
  separate address spaces. Process isolation technologies, including sandboxing
  or virtualization, logically separate software and firmware from other
  software, firmware, and data. Process isolation helps limit the access of
  potentially untrusted software to other system resources. The capability to
  maintain separate execution domains is available in commercial operating
  systems that employ multi-state processor technologies. Related Control(s):

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

test-results: UDS leverages containerization which inherently provides process
  isolation. Each container has its own isolated process space, and the Linux
  kernel prevents processes in different containers from interacting except
  through defined interfaces (like network calls which are mediated by the
  service mesh). The container runtime and Kubernetes ensure that one container
  cannot directly read/write the memory of another. Namespaces, cgroups, and
  seccomp profiles can be used to further isolate processes. So, one
  application’s processes cannot interfere with or spy on another. This is a
  fundamental security benefit of the UDS’s architecture.
