  Description:

  a. Develop, document, and disseminate to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles]:

  1. [Selection (one or more): Organization-level; Mission/business
  process-level; System-level] system and communications protection policy that:
    (a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
    (b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and
  2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system and
  communications protection policy and the associated system and communications
  protection controls;

  b. Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the
  development, documentation, and dissemination of the system and communications
  protection policy and procedures; and

  c. Review and update the current system and communications protection:

  1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events]; and

  2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  System and communications protection policy and procedures address the
  controls in the SC family that are implemented within systems and
  organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in
  establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute
  to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security
  and privacy programs collaborate on the development of system and
  communications protection policy and procedures. Security and privacy program
  policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general,
  and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and
  procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and
  privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex
  nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and
  privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if
  needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and
  can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
  Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or
  more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to system and
  communications protection policy and procedures include assessment or audit
  findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws,
  executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and
  guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational
  policy or procedure. Related Control(s): PM-9, PS-8, SA-8, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; system and
  communications protection procedures; system security plan; privacy plan; risk
  management strategy documentation; audit findings; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and
  communications protection responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security and privacy responsibilities].

  Determine if:

  - system and communications protection procedures to facilitate the
  implementation of the system and communications protection policy and
  associated system and communications protection controls are developed and
  documented.

  - the system and communications protection procedures are disseminated to
  [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: SC-1.2, SC-1.5,
  SC-1.6; as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-004854. The
  resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following
  Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance
  statement: SC-1.2. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant
  because of the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment
  procedure that has not been previously assessed: CCI-004854.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (This is must be documented and
  managed outside of UDS.)

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
