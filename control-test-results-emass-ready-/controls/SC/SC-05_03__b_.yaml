control-acronym: "[r5] SC-05(03)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Employ the following monitoring tools to detect indicators of
  denial-of-service attacks against, or launched from, the system: [Assignment:
  organization-defined monitoring tools]; and

  (b) Monitor the following system resources to determine if sufficient
  resources exist to prevent effective denial-of-service attacks: [Assignment:
  organization-defined system resources].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations consider the utilization and capacity of system resources when
  managing risk associated with a denial of service due to malicious attacks.
  Denial-of-service attacks can originate from external or internal sources.
  System resources that are sensitive to denial of service include physical disk
  storage, memory, and CPU cycles. Techniques used to prevent denial-of-service
  attacks related to storage utilization and capacity include instituting disk
  quotas, configuring systems to automatically alert administrators when
  specific storage capacity thresholds are reached, using file compression
  technologies to maximize available storage space, and imposing separate
  partitions for system and user data. Related Control(s): CA-7, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing denial-of-service protection; system design documentation; system
  monitoring tools and techniques documentation; system configuration settings
  and associated documentation; system audit records; system security plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with detection and monitoring responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms/tools implementing system monitoring for
  denial-of-service attacks].
