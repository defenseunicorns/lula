control-acronym: "[r5] SC-15"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Prohibit remote activation of collaborative computing devices and
  applications with the following exceptions: [Assignment: organization-defined
  exceptions where remote activation is to be allowed]; and

  b. Provide an explicit indication of use to users physically present at the
  devices.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Collaborative computing devices and applications include remote meeting
  devices and applications, networked white boards, cameras, and microphones.
  The explicit indication of use includes signals to users when collaborative
  computing devices and applications are activated. Related Control(s): AC-21,
  SC-42.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing collaborative computing; access control policy and procedures;
  system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system audit records; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with responsibilities for managing collaborative
  computing devices].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the management
  of remote activation of collaborative computing devices; mechanisms providing
  an indication of use of collaborative computing devices].

  be allowed."
implementation-guidance: CCI-001151 of this assessment procedure is
  automatically compliant because of coverage by DoD Enterprise.

test-results: >-
  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: SC-15.1, SC-15.2.
  The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following
  Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance
  statement: SC-15.1.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS does not involve devices like
  smart whiteboards, VTC, or cameras where indicator lights would be relevant.)

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.
