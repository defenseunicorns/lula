control-information: >-
  Description:

  Employ the following actions to validate that policies are established and
  implemented controls are operating in a consistent manner: [Assignment:
  organization-defined actions].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Security and privacy controls are often added incrementally to a system. As a
  result, policies for selecting and implementing controls may be inconsistent,
  and the controls could fail to work together in a consistent or coordinated
  manner. At a minimum, the lack of consistency and coordination could mean that
  there are unacceptable security and privacy gaps in the system. At worst, it
  could mean that some of the controls implemented in one location or by one
  component are actually impeding the functionality of other controls (e.g.,
  encrypting internal network traffic can impede monitoring). In other
  situations, failing to consistently monitor all implemented network protocols
  (e.g., a dual stack of IPv4 and IPv6) may create unintended vulnerabilities in
  the system that could be exploited by adversaries. It is important to
  validate—through testing, monitoring, and analysis—that the implemented
  controls are operating in a consistent, coordinated, non-interfering manner.
  Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Assessment, authorization, and monitoring policy;
  organizational continuous monitoring strategy; system-level continuous
  monitoring strategy; procedures addressing continuous monitoring of system
  security controls; assessment report; plan of action and milestones; system
  monitoring records; security impact analyses; status reports; system security
  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with continuous monitoring
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting consistency analyses].
