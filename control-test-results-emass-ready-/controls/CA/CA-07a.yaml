control-information: >-
  Description:

  Develop a system-level continuous monitoring strategy and implement continuous
  monitoring in accordance with the organization-level continuous monitoring
  strategy that includes:

  a. Establishing the following system-level metrics to be monitored:
  [Assignment: organization-defined system-level metrics];

  b. Establishing [Assignment: organization-defined frequencies] for monitoring
  and [Assignment: organization-defined frequencies] for assessment of control
  effectiveness;

  c. Ongoing control assessments in accordance with the continuous monitoring
  strategy;

  d. Ongoing monitoring of system and organization-defined metrics in accordance
  with the continuous monitoring strategy;

  e. Correlation and analysis of information generated by control assessments
  and monitoring;

  f. Response actions to address results of the analysis of control assessment
  and monitoring information; and

  g. Reporting the security and privacy status of the system to [Assignment:
  organization-defined personnel or roles] [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Continuous monitoring at the system level facilitates ongoing awareness of the
  system security and privacy posture to support organizational risk management
  decisions. The terms continuous and ongoing imply that organizations assess
  and monitor their controls and risks at a frequency sufficient to support
  risk-based decisions. Different types of controls may require different
  monitoring frequencies. The results of continuous monitoring generate risk
  response actions by organizations. When monitoring the effectiveness of
  multiple controls that have been grouped into capabilities, a root-cause
  analysis may be needed to determine the specific control that has failed.
  Continuous monitoring programs allow organizations to maintain the
  authorizations of systems and common controls in highly dynamic environments
  of operation with changing mission and business needs, threats,
  vulnerabilities, and technologies. Having access to security and privacy
  information on a continuing basis through reports and dashboards gives
  organizational officials the ability to make effective and timely risk
  management decisions, including ongoing authorization decisions.


  Automation supports more frequent updates to hardware, software, and firmware
  inventories, authorization packages, and other system information.
  Effectiveness is further enhanced when continuous monitoring outputs are
  formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable, actionable,
  relevant, and timely. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in
  accordance with the security categories of systems. Monitoring requirements,
  including the need for specific monitoring, may be referenced in other
  controls and control enhancements, such as AC-2g, AC-2(7), AC-2(12)(a),

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: CA-7.2; as well as
  the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-003874. The resulting
  compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following Rev. 4
  assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance statement:
  CA-7.2. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because of
  the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that
  has not been previously assessed: CCI-003874.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Continuous monitoring in NIST terms
  involves tracking security state on an ongoing basis. UDS contributes
  significantly to technical continuous monitoring: NeuVector continuously
  monitors runtime for threats and compliance issues, Prometheus and Grafana
  continuously monitor system health and can detect anomalies, and logs are
  continuously collected for review. These tools provide an ongoing view of
  security (e.g., vulnerability scan results are updated as new images are
  deployed, network attacks are caught in real time). However, a full continuous
  monitoring program includes analyzing those results and updating risk
  assessments periodically, which involves personnel. UDS automates the data
  collection and part of the analysis (real-time alerts), effectively
  implementing the technical monitoring portion of CA-7. What it doesnâ€™t do by
  itself is the formal reporting and review cycle (that is done by the
  cybersecurity team). So, the technological capability for continuous
  monitoring is present (covering events, vulnerabilities, compliance drift),
  but integrating that into an official program is up to the organization.)
