control-acronym: "[r5] CA-03(06)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Verify that individuals or systems transferring data between interconnecting
  systems have the requisite authorizations (i.e., write permissions or
  privileges) prior to accepting such data.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  To prevent unauthorized individuals and systems from making information
  transfers to protected systems, the protected system verifies—via independent
  means— whether the individual or system attempting to transfer information is
  authorized to do so. Verification of the authorization to transfer information
  also applies to control plane traffic (e.g., routing and DNS) and services
  (e.g., authenticated SMTP relays). Related Control(s): AC-2, AC-3, AC-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing system
  connections; system and communications protection policy; system
  interconnection agreements; information exchange security agreements;
  memoranda of understanding or agreements; service level agreements;
  non-disclosure agreements; system design documentation; system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; control assessment report; system audit
  records; system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  managing connections to external systems; network administrators;
  organizational personnel with information security and privacy
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing restrictions on external system
  connections].
