control-acronym: "[r5] CA-03"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Approve and manage the exchange of information between the system and other
  systems using [Selection (one or more): interconnection security agreements;
  information exchange security agreements; memoranda of understanding or
  agreement; service level agreements; user agreements; nondisclosure
  agreements; [Assignment: organization-defined type of agreement]];

  b. Document, as part of each exchange agreement, the interface
  characteristics, security and privacy requirements, controls, and
  responsibilities for each system, and the impact level of the information
  communicated; and

  c. Review and update the agreements [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  System information exchange requirements apply to information exchanges
  between two or more systems. System information exchanges include connections
  via leased lines or virtual private networks, connections to internet service
  providers, database sharing or exchanges of database transaction information,
  connections and exchanges with cloud services, exchanges via web-based
  services, or exchanges of files via file transfer protocols, network protocols
  (e.g., IPv4, IPv6), email, or other organization-to-organization
  communications. Organizations consider the risk related to new or increased
  threats that may be introduced when systems exchange information with other
  systems that may have different security and privacy requirements and
  controls. This includes systems within the same organization and systems that
  are external to the organization. A joint authorization of the systems
  exchanging information, as described in CA-6(1) or CA-6(2), may help to
  communicate and reduce risk.


  Authorizing officials determine the risk associated with system information
  exchange and the controls needed for appropriate risk mitigation. The types of
  agreements selected are based on factors such as the impact level of the
  information being exchanged, the relationship between the organizations
  exchanging information (e.g., government to government, government to
  business, business to business, government or business to service provider,
  government or business to individual), or the level of access to the
  organizational system by users of the other system. If systems that exchange
  information have the same authorizing official, organizations need not develop
  agreements. Instead, the interface characteristics between the systems (e.g.,
  how the information is being exchanged. how the information is protected) are
  described in the respective security and privacy plans. If the systems that
  exchange information have different authorizing officials within the same
  organization, the organizations can develop agreements or provide the same
  information that would be provided in the appropriate agreement type from
  CA-3a in the respective security and privacy plans for the systems.
  Organizations may incorporate agreement information into formal contracts,
  especially for information exchanges established between federal agencies and
  nonfederal organizations (including service providers, contractors, system
  developers, and system integrators). Risk considerations include systems that
  share the same networks. Related Control(s): AC-4, AC-20, AU-16, CA-6, IA-3,
  IR-4, PL-2, PT-7, RA-3, SA-9, SC-7, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing system
  connections; system and communications protection policy; system
  interconnection security agreements; information exchange security agreements;
  memoranda of understanding or agreements; service level agreements;
  non-disclosure agreements; system design documentation; enterprise
  architecture; system architecture; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  developing, implementing, or approving system interconnection agreements;
  organizational personnel with information security and privacy
  responsibilities; personnel managing the system(s) to which the
  interconnection security agreement applies].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: CA-3.5, CA-3.6.
  The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following
  Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance
  statement: CA-3.5.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS can enforce technical controls on
  external system connections (as discussed in AC-20) – for example, only
  allowing connections to approved external services and using secure protocols.
  If UDS needs to connect with another system (like a data feed or identity
  service), those connections can be governed by configuration and monitored..
  However, the requirement to obtain formal authorization for interconnection is
  an organizational responsibility. The stack itself cannot grant or record
  “interconnection agreements;” it can only enforce security on the connection.)

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.
