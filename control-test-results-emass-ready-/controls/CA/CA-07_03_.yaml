control-information: >-
  Description:

  Employ trend analyses to determine if control implementations, the frequency
  of continuous monitoring activities, and the types of activities used in the
  continuous monitoring process need to be modified based on empirical data.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Trend analyses include examining recent threat information that addresses the
  types of threat events that have occurred in the organization or the Federal
  Government, success rates of certain types of attacks, emerging
  vulnerabilities in technologies, evolving social engineering techniques, the
  effectiveness of configuration settings, results from multiple control
  assessments, and findings from Inspectors General or auditors. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Organizational continuous monitoring strategy;
  system-level continuous monitoring strategy; assessment, authorization, and
  monitoring policy; procedures addressing continuous monitoring of system
  controls; privacy controls; assessment report; plan of action and milestones;
  system monitoring records; impact analyses; status reports; system security
  plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with continuous monitoring
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities].

  Determine if:

  - trend analysis is employed to determine if control implementations used in
  the continuous monitoring process need to be modified based on empirical data.

  - trend analysis is employed to determine if the frequency of continuous
  monitoring activities used in the continuous monitoring process needs to be
  modified based on empirical data.

  - trend analysis is employed to determine if the types of activities used in
  the continuous monitoring process need to be modified based on empirical data.
