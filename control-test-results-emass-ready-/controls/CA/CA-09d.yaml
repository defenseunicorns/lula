control-acronym: "[r5] CA-09"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Authorize internal connections of [Assignment: organization-defined system
  components or classes of components] to the system;

  b. Document, for each internal connection, the interface characteristics,
  security and privacy requirements, and the nature of the information
  communicated;

  c. Terminate internal system connections after [Assignment:
  organization-defined conditions]; and

  d. Review [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] the continued need for
  each internal connection.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Internal system connections are connections between organizational systems and
  separate constituent system components (i.e., connections between components
  that are part of the same system) including components used for system
  development. Intra-system connections include connections with mobile devices,
  notebook and desktop computers, tablets, printers, copiers, facsimile
  machines, scanners, sensors, and servers. Instead of authorizing each internal
  system connection individually, organizations can authorize internal
  connections for a class of system components with common characteristics
  and/or configurations, including printers, scanners, and copiers with a
  specified processing, transmission, and storage capability or smart phones and
  tablets with a specific baseline configuration. The continued need for an
  internal system connection is reviewed from the perspective of whether it
  provides support for organizational missions or business functions. Related

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Assessment, authorization, and monitoring policy;
  access control policy; procedures addressing system connections; system and
  communications protection policy; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; list of components or
  classes of components authorized as internal system connections; assessment
  report; system audit records; system security plan; privacy plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  developing, implementing, or authorizing internal system connections;
  organizational personnel with information security and privacy
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting internal system connections].
