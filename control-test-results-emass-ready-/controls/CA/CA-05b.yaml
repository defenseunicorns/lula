control-acronym: "[r5] CA-05"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop a plan of action and milestones for the system to document the
  planned remediation actions of the organization to correct weaknesses or
  deficiencies noted during the assessment of the controls and to reduce or
  eliminate known vulnerabilities in the system; and

  b. Update existing plan of action and milestones [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] based on the findings from control
  assessments, independent audits or reviews, and continuous monitoring
  activities.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Plans of action and milestones are useful for any type of organization to
  track planned remedial actions. Plans of action and milestones are required in
  authorization packages and subject to federal reporting requirements
  established by OMB. Related Control(s): CA-2, CA-7, PM-4, PM-9, RA-7, SI-2,
  SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Assessment, authorization, and monitoring policy;
  procedures addressing plan of action and milestones; control assessment plan;
  control assessment report; control assessment evidence; plan of action and
  milestones; system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with plan of action and
  milestones development and implementation responsibilities; organizational
  personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms for developing, implementing, and maintaining
  plan of action and milestones].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: CA-5.2, CA-5.3.
  The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following
  Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance
  statement: CA-5.3.


  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
