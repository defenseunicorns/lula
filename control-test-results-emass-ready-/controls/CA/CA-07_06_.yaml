control-information: >-
  Description:

  Ensure the accuracy, currency, and availability of monitoring results for the
  system using [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Using automated tools for monitoring helps to maintain the accuracy, currency,
  and availability of monitoring information which in turns helps to increase
  the level of ongoing awareness of the system security and privacy posture in
  support of organizational risk management decisions. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Assessment, authorization, and monitoring policy;
