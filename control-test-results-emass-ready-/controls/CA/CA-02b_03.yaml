control-acronym: "[r5] CA-02"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Select the appropriate assessor or assessment team for the type of
  assessment to be conducted;

  b. Develop a control assessment plan that describes the scope of the
  assessment including:

  1. Controls and control enhancements under assessment;

  2. Assessment procedures to be used to determine control effectiveness; and

  3. Assessment environment, assessment team, and assessment roles and
  responsibilities;

  c. Ensure the control assessment plan is reviewed and approved by the
  authorizing official or designated representative prior to conducting the
  assessment;

  d. Assess the controls in the system and its environment of operation
  [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to determine the extent to which
  the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing
  the desired outcome with respect to meeting established security and privacy
  requirements;

  e. Produce a control assessment report that document the results of the
  assessment; and

  f. Provide the results of the control assessment to [Assignment:
  organization-defined individuals or roles].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations ensure that control assessors possess the required skills and
  technical expertise to develop effective assessment plans and to conduct
  assessments of system-specific, hybrid, common, and program management
  controls, as appropriate. The required skills include general knowledge of
  risk management concepts and approaches as well as comprehensive knowledge of
  and experience with the hardware, software, and firmware system components
  implemented.


  Organizations assess controls in systems and the environments in which those
  systems operate as part of initial and ongoing authorizations, continuous
  monitoring, FISMA annual assessments, system design and development, systems
  security engineering, privacy engineering, and the system development life
  cycle. Assessments help to ensure that organizations meet information security
  and privacy requirements, identify weaknesses and deficiencies in the system
  design and development process, provide essential information needed to make
  risk-based decisions as part of authorization processes, and comply with
  vulnerability mitigation procedures. Organizations conduct assessments on the
  implemented controls as documented in security and privacy plans. Assessments
  can also be conducted throughout the system development life cycle as part of
  systems engineering and systems security engineering processes. The design for
  controls can be assessed as RFPs are developed, responses assessed, and design
  reviews conducted. If a design to implement controls and subsequent
  implementation in accordance with the design are assessed during development,
  the final control testing can be a simple confirmation utilizing previously
  completed control assessment and aggregating the outcomes.


  Organizations may develop a single, consolidated security and privacy
  assessment plan for the system or maintain separate plans. A consolidated
  assessment plan clearly delineates the roles and responsibilities for control
  assessment. If multiple organizations participate in assessing a system, a
  coordinated approach can reduce redundancies and associated costs.


  Organizations can use other types of assessment activities, such as
  vulnerability scanning and system monitoring, to maintain the security and
  privacy posture of systems during the system life cycle. Assessment reports
  document assessment results in sufficient detail, as deemed necessary by
  organizations, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and
  whether the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and
  producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting requirements. Assessment
  results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of
  assessments being conducted. For example, assessments conducted in support of
  authorization decisions are provided to authorizing officials, senior agency
  officials for privacy, senior agency information security officers, and
  authorizing official designated representatives.


  To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment
  results from the following sources: initial or ongoing system authorizations,
  continuous monitoring, systems engineering processes, or system development
  life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that assessment results are
  current, relevant to the determination of control effectiveness, and obtained
  with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing control
  assessment results can be reused to the extent that the results are still
  valid and can also be supplemented with additional assessments as needed.
  After the initial authorizations, organizations assess controls during
  continuous monitoring. Organizations also establish the frequency for ongoing
  assessments in accordance with organizational continuous monitoring
  strategies. External audits, including audits by external entities such as
  regulatory agencies, are outside of the scope of CA-2. Related Control(s):

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
