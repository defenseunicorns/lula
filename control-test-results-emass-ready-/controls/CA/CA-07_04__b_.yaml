  Description:

  Ensure risk monitoring is an integral part of the continuous monitoring
  strategy that includes the following:

  (a) Effectiveness monitoring;

  (b) Compliance monitoring; and

  (c) Change monitoring.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Risk monitoring is informed by the established organizational risk tolerance.
  Effectiveness monitoring determines the ongoing effectiveness of the
  implemented risk response measures. Compliance monitoring verifies that
  required risk response measures are implemented. It also verifies that
  security and privacy requirements are satisfied. Change monitoring identifies
  changes to organizational systems and environments of operation that may
  affect security and privacy risk. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
