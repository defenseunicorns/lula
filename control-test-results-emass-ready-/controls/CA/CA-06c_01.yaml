control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Assign a senior official as the authorizing official for the system;

  b. Assign a senior official as the authorizing official for common controls
  available for inheritance by organizational systems;

  c. Ensure that the authorizing official for the system, before commencing
  operations:

  1. Accepts the use of common controls inherited by the system; and

  2. Authorizes the system to operate;

  d. Ensure that the authorizing official for common controls authorizes the use
  of those controls for inheritance by organizational systems;

  e. Update the authorizations [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Authorizations are official management decisions by senior officials to
  authorize operation of systems, authorize the use of common controls for
  inheritance by organizational systems, and explicitly accept the risk to
  organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and
  the Nation based on the implementation of agreed-upon controls. Authorizing
  officials provide budgetary oversight for organizational systems and common
  controls or assume responsibility for the mission and business functions
  supported by those systems or common controls. The authorization process is a
  federal responsibility, and therefore, authorizing officials must be federal
  employees. Authorizing officials are both responsible and accountable for
  security and privacy risks associated with the operation and use of
  organizational systems. Nonfederal organizations may have similar processes to
  authorize systems and senior officials that assume the authorization role and
  associated responsibilities.


  Authorizing officials issue ongoing authorizations of systems based on
  evidence produced from implemented continuous monitoring programs. Robust
  continuous monitoring programs reduce the need for separate reauthorization
  processes. Through the employment of comprehensive continuous monitoring
  processes, the information contained in authorization packages (i.e., security
  and privacy plans, assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones) is
  updated on an ongoing basis. This provides authorizing officials, common
  control providers, and system owners with an up-to-date status of the security
  and privacy posture of their systems, controls, and operating environments. To
  reduce the cost of reauthorization, authorizing officials can leverage the
  results of continuous monitoring processes to the maximum extent possible as
  the basis for rendering reauthorization decisions. Related Control(s): CA-2,
  CA-3, CA-7, PM-9, PM-10, RA-3, SA-10, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Assessment, authorization, and monitoring policy;
  procedures addressing authorization; system security plan, privacy plan,
  assessment report, plan of action and milestones; authorization statement;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with authorization
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms that facilitate authorizations and updates].
