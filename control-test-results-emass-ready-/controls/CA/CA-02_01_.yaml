control-information: >-
  Description:

  Employ independent assessors or assessment teams to conduct control
  assessments.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Independent assessors or assessment teams are individuals or groups who
  conduct impartial assessments of systems. Impartiality means that assessors
  are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest regarding the
  development, operation, sustainment, or management of the systems under
  assessment or the determination of control effectiveness. To achieve
  impartiality, assessors do not create a mutual or conflicting interest with
  the organizations where the assessments are being conducted, assess their own
  work, act as management or employees of the organizations they are serving, or
  place themselves in positions of advocacy for the organizations acquiring
  their services.


  Independent assessments can be obtained from elements within organizations or
  be contracted to public or private sector entities outside of organizations.
  Authorizing officials determine the required level of independence based on
  the security categories of systems and/or the risk to organizational
  operations, organizational assets, or individuals. Authorizing officials also
  determine if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance
  that the results are sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based
  decisions. Assessor independence determination includes whether contracted
  assessment services have sufficient independence, such as when system owners
  are not directly involved in contracting processes or cannot influence the
  impartiality of the assessors conducting the assessments. During the system
  design and development phase, having independent assessors is analogous to
  having independent SMEs involved in design reviews.


  When organizations that own the systems are small or the structures of the
  organizations require that assessments be conducted by individuals that are in
  the developmental, operational, or management chain of the system owners,
  independence in assessment processes can be achieved by ensuring that
  assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by independent teams of
  experts to validate the completeness, accuracy, integrity, and reliability of
  the results. Assessments performed for purposes other than to support
  authorization decisions are more likely to be useable for such decisions when
  performed by assessors with sufficient independence, thereby reducing the need
  to repeat assessments. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
