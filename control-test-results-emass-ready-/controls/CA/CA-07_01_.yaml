control-acronym: "[r5] CA-07(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Employ independent assessors or assessment teams to monitor the controls in
  the system on an ongoing basis.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations maximize the value of control assessments by requiring that
  assessments be conducted by assessors with appropriate levels of independence.
  The level of required independence is based on organizational continuous
  monitoring strategies. Assessor independence provides a degree of impartiality
  to the monitoring process. To achieve such impartiality, assessors do not
  create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations where the
  assessments are being conducted, assess their own work, act as management or
  employees of the organizations they are serving, or place themselves in
  advocacy positions for the organizations acquiring their services. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
