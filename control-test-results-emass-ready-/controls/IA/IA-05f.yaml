  Description:

  Manage system authenticators by:

  a. Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity
  of the individual, group, role, service, or device receiving the
  authenticator;

  b. Establishing initial authenticator content for any authenticators issued by
  the organization;

  c. Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for
  their intended use;

  d. Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial
  authenticator distribution, for lost or compromised or damaged authenticators,
  and for revoking authenticators;

  e. Changing default authenticators prior to first use;

  f. Changing or refreshing authenticators [Assignment: organization-defined
  time period by authenticator type] or when [Assignment: organization-defined
  events] occur;

  g. Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and
  modification;

  h. Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific
  controls to protect authenticators; and

  i. Changing authenticators for group or role accounts when membership to those
  accounts changes.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Authenticators include passwords, cryptographic devices, biometrics,
  certificates, one-time password devices, and ID badges. Device authenticators
  include certificates and passwords. Initial authenticator content is the
  actual content of the authenticator (e.g., the initial password). In contrast,
  the requirements for authenticator content contain specific criteria or
  characteristics (e.g., minimum password length). Developers may deliver system
  components with factory default authentication credentials (i.e., passwords)
  to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication
  credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, and present a
  significant risk. The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be
  implemented via control PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of
  individuals and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators stored in
  organizational systems, including passwords stored in hashed or encrypted
  formats or files containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with
  administrator privileges.


  Systems support authenticator management by organization-defined settings and
  restrictions for various authenticator characteristics (e.g., minimum password
  length, validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and
  number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric
  authentication). Actions can be taken to safeguard individual authenticators,
  including maintaining possession of authenticators, not sharing authenticators
  with others, and immediately reporting lost, stolen, or compromised
  authenticators. Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking
  authenticators for temporary access when no longer needed. Related Control(s):

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; system
  security plan; addressing authenticator management; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  list of system authenticator types; change control records associated with
  managing system authenticators; system audit records; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with authenticator
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing authenticator
  management capability].

  In UDS, authenticators such as user session tokens managed by Keycloak and
  mTLS certificates managed by Istio are configured with minimum lifetime
  restrictions to ensure stability and security. Keycloak enforces that session
  tokens and passwords maintain a predefined lifespan before they can be renewed
  or rotated, preventing overly frequent changes that might introduce
  vulnerabilities or operational inconsistencies. Similarly, Istio issues
  service certificates with a validity period that complies with these minimum
  lifetime requirements, ensuring consistent and secure service-to-service
  authentication.

  UDS manages maximum lifetime restrictions for authenticators effectively
  through its centralized identity management solution, Keycloak. Keycloak
  inherently supports configurable maximum lifetime restrictions for
  authenticators, including enforcing password expiration periods, session
  lifetimes, and time-limited tokens (JWT), in alignment with organizationally
  defined security requirements. Administrators can configure Keycloak to
  enforce maximum credential ages, requiring users to periodically update
  passwords or re-authenticate to renew expired tokens, ensuring ongoing
  compliance and reducing risk from authenticator compromise.

  UDS supports and facilitates managing authenticator refresh and renewal
  processes in accordance with organizationally defined intervals through its
  integrated identity management component, Keycloak. Specifically, Keycloak
  provides configurable options to enforce periodic renewal of authenticators,
  including password expiration intervals, regular rotation of cryptographic
  keys used for JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and reissuance of multifactor
  authentication (MFA) credentials (e.g., OTP and U2F tokens). Through these
  configurable options, organizations can explicitly set and enforce
  authenticator lifetimes consistent with internal policies or regulatory
  requirements. 

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.
