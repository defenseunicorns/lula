  Description:

  Uniquely identify and authenticate organizational users and associate that
  unique identification with processes acting on behalf of those users.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations can satisfy the identification and authentication requirements
  by complying with the requirements in HSPD 12. Organizational users include
  employees or individuals who organizations consider to have an equivalent
  status to employees (e.g., contractors and guest researchers). Unique
  identification and authentication of users applies to all accesses other than
  those that are explicitly identified in AC-14 and that occur through the
  authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication.
  Since processes execute on behalf of groups and roles, organizations may
  require unique identification of individuals in group accounts or for detailed
  accountability of individual activity.


  Organizations employ passwords, physical authenticators, or biometrics to
  authenticate user identities or, in the case of multi-factor authentication,
  some combination thereof. Access to organizational systems is defined as
  either local access or network access. Local access is any access to
  organizational systems by users or processes acting on behalf of users, where
  access is obtained through direct connections without the use of networks.
  Network access is access to organizational systems by users (or processes
  acting on behalf of users) where access is obtained through network
  connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network
  access that involves communication through external networks. Internal
  networks include local area networks and wide area networks.


  The use of encrypted virtual private networks for network connections between
  organization-controlled endpoints and non-organization-controlled endpoints
  may be treated as internal networks with respect to protecting the
  confidentiality and integrity of information traversing the network.
  Identification and authentication requirements for non-organizational users
  are described in IA-8. Related Control(s): AC-2, AC-3, AC-4, AC-14, AC-17,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing user identification and authentication; system security plan,
  system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system audit records; list of system accounts; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system operations
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  account management responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for uniquely identifying and
  authenticating users; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing identification
  and authentication capabilities].

test-results: UDS provides robust user identification and authentication via
  Keycloak, which serves as the central Identity Provider. Every user must
  authenticate with unique credentials (username/password, or certificates,
  etc.), and Keycloak verifies their identity before granting access to JWT
  tokens. This means the system positively identifies each user. Keycloak
  supports a variety of authentication mechanisms (from passwords to two-factor
  to smart cards), ensuring users are strongly authenticated before access.
  Moreover, for internal components, Istio mutual TLS ensures that even services
  identify each other with certificates. So whether itâ€™s a human user or a
  service account, the stack has mechanisms to require proper authentication. By
  using Keycloak across all applications (single sign-on), UDS ensures
  consistent enforcement of user auth for all entry points.
