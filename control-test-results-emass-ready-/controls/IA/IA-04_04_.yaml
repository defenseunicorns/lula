control-acronym: "[r5] IA-04(04)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Manage individual identifiers by uniquely identifying each individual as
  [Assignment: organization-defined characteristic identifying individual
  status].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Characteristics that identify the status of individuals include contractors,
  foreign nationals, and non-organizational users. Identifying the status of
  individuals by these characteristics provides additional information about the
  people with whom organizational personnel are communicating. For example, it
  might be useful for a government employee to know that one of the individuals
  on an email message is a contractor. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; system
  security plan; procedures addressing identifier management; procedures
  addressing account management; list of characteristics identifying individual
  status; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with identifier management
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing identifier
  management].

  providing system or Common Control Package.

  UDS fully supports managing individual identifiers through its integrated
  identity management solution, Keycloak, ensuring each user is uniquely
  identified according to defined organizational characteristics (government
  employee or contractor, including nationality). Keycloak's flexible username
  and account schema can strictly follow DoD-defined naming conventions and
  formats (e.g., per implementation guidance; john.smith.ctr@army.mil,
  john.smith.uk@army.mil, or combined identifiers such as
  john.smith.ctr.uk@army.mil). Display names within Keycloak and integrated
  applications are similarly configurable to reflect appropriate organizational
  conventions, clearly identifying users as contractors, government employees,
  or foreign nationals.
