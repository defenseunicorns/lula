  Description:

  For password-based authentication:

  (a) Maintain a list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords and
  update the list [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and when
  organizational passwords are suspected to have been compromised directly or
  indirectly;

  (b) Verify, when users create or update passwords, that the passwords are not
  found on the list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords in
  IA-5(1)(a);

  (c) Transmit passwords only over cryptographically-protected channels;

  (d) Store passwords using an approved salted key derivation function,
  preferably using a keyed hash;

  (e) Require immediate selection of a new password upon account recovery;

  (f) Allow user selection of long passwords and passphrases, including spaces
  and all printable characters;

  (g) Employ automated tools to assist the user in selecting strong password
  authenticators; and

  (h) Enforce the following composition and complexity rules: [Assignment:
  organization-defined composition and complexity rules].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Password-based authentication applies to passwords regardless of whether they
  are used in single-factor or multi-factor authentication. Long passwords or
  passphrases are preferable over shorter passwords. Enforced composition rules
  provide marginal security benefits while decreasing usability. However,
  organizations may choose to establish certain rules for password generation
  (e.g., minimum character length for long passwords) under certain
  circumstances and can enforce this requirement in IA-5(1)(h). Account recovery
  can occur, for example, in situations when a password is forgotten.
  Cryptographically protected passwords include salted one-way cryptographic
  hashes of passwords. The list of commonly used, compromised, or expected
  passwords includes passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses,
  dictionary words, and repetitive or sequential characters. The list includes
  context-specific words, such as the name of the service, username, and
  derivatives thereof. Related Control(s): IA-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; password
  policy; procedures addressing authenticator management; system security plan;
  system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; password configurations and associated documentation; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with authenticator
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing password-based
  authenticator management capability].

test-results: UDS employs Keycloak as its central Identity and Access Management
  solution, which securely stores user passwords exclusively in
  cryptographically protected forms. Specifically, Keycloak does not store
  plaintext passwords; instead, it employs strong, industry-standard
  cryptographic hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, PBKDF2, or Argon2) combined
  with unique salts for each user credential. In FIPS environments, Keycloak
  uses PBKDF2 with SHA512 as the default password hashing algorithm. This
  ensures passwords remain secure even in the event of database compromise, as
  stored hashes cannot feasibly be reversed or decrypted.

  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: IA-5(1).12; as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements:
