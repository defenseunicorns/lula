  Description:

  Accept and electronically verify Personal Identity Verification-compliant
  credentials from other federal agencies.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Acceptance of Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials from other
  federal agencies applies to both logical and physical access control systems.
  PIV credentials are those credentials issued by federal agencies that conform
  to FIPS Publication 201 and supporting guidelines. The adequacy and
  reliability of PIV card issuers are addressed and authorized using SP
  800-79-2. Related Control(s): PE-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; system
  security plan; procedures addressing user identification and authentication;
  system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system audit records; PIV verification records; evidence of PIV
  credentials; PIV credential authorizations; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system operations
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers;
  organizational personnel with account management responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing identification
  and authentication capabilities; mechanisms that accept and verify PIV
  credentials].
