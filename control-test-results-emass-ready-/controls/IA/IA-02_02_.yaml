  Description:

  Implement multi-factor authentication for access to non-privileged accounts.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Multi-factor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors
  to achieve authentication. The authentication factors are defined as follows:
  something you know (e.g., a personal identification number [PIN]), something
  you have (e.g., a physical authenticator such as a cryptographic private key),
  or something you are (e.g., a biometric). Multi-factor authentication
  solutions that feature physical authenticators include hardware authenticators
  that provide time-based or challenge-response outputs and smart cards such as
  the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card or the DoD Common
  Access Card. In addition to authenticating users at the system level,
  organizations may also employ authentication mechanisms at the application
  level, at their discretion, to provide increased information security.
  Regardless of the type of access (i.e., local, network, remote),
  non-privileged accounts are authenticated using multi-factor options
  appropriate for the level of risk. Organizations can provide additional
  security measures, such as additional or more rigorous authentication
  mechanisms, for specific types of access. Related Control(s): AC-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: IA-2(2).1,
  IA-2(4).1, IA-5(11).1, IA-5(11).2. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally
  entered test result/compliance statement: IA-2(4).1.


  Consistent with IA-2(1).1, UDS enforces mandatory multifactor authentication
  (MFA) for all non-privileged user accounts accessing the network. UDS
  leverages Keycloak to require MFA, supporting secure, DoD-approved mechanisms
  such as Common Access Card (CAC) or Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards
  paired with a PIN. Additionally, Keycloak offers flexible MFA options
  including One-Time Passwords (OTP), mobile push notifications, and Universal
  2nd Factor (U2F) hardware tokens, ensuring comprehensive MFA coverage aligned
  with organizational policies and security requirements.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Similarly to IA-2(3), this is
  multi-factor for local access for non-privileged users. UDS doesn’t have local
  interactive access for non-privileged users at all (no one is logging directly
  into a container or host with a user account; they go through network
  services).

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.

  In UDS, token-based authentication is engineered to meet organization-defined
  token quality requirements by enforcing the use of only DoD-approved PKI
  credentials. Keycloak is configured to accept and validate certificates in
  accordance with DoDI 8520.02 and DoDI 8520.03. For unclassified systems, this
  means accepting DoD PKI credentials, External Certification Authority (ECA)
  PKI credentials, and other DoD-approved external PKI credentials, while for
  SIPRNet deployments only DoD PKI and NSS PKI credentials are permitted. When
  external PKI credentials are accepted, Keycloak verifies that the certificate
  includes the required Certificate Policy Object Identifiers (OIDs) that
  represent approved assurance levels. Additionally, Istio’s mutual TLS is used
  to secure service-to-service communications by ensuring that only tokens
  derived from these validated certificates are accepted.
