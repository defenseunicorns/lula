control-acronym: "[r5] IA-02(06)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Implement multi-factor authentication for [Selection (one or more): local;
  network; remote] access to [Selection (one or more): privileged accounts;
  non-privileged accounts] such that:

  (a) One of the factors is provided by a device separate from the system
  gaining access; and

  (b) The device meets [Assignment: organization-defined strength of mechanism
  requirements].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The purpose of requiring a device that is separate from the system to which
  the user is attempting to gain access for one of the factors during
  multi-factor authentication is to reduce the likelihood of compromising
  authenticators or credentials stored on the system. Adversaries may be able to
  compromise such authenticators or credentials and subsequently impersonate
  authorized users. Implementing one of the factors on a separate device (e.g.,
  a hardware token), provides a greater strength of mechanism and an increased
  level of assurance in the authentication process. Related Control(s): AC-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; system
  security plan; procedures addressing user identification and authentication;
  system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system audit records; list of system accounts; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system operations
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing multi-factor
  authentication capability].
