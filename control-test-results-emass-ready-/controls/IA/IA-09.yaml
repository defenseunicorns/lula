control-acronym: "[r5] IA-09"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Uniquely identify and authenticate [Assignment: organization-defined system
  services and applications] before establishing communications with devices,
  users, or other services or applications.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Services that may require identification and authentication include web
  applications using digital certificates or services or applications that query
  a database. Identification and authentication methods for system services and
  applications include information or code signing, provenance graphs, and
  electronic signatures that indicate the sources of services. Decisions
  regarding the validity of identification and authentication claims can be made
  by services separate from the services acting on those decisions. This can
  occur in distributed system architectures. In such situations, the
  identification and authentication decisions (instead of actual identifiers and
  authentication data) are provided to the services that need to act on those
  decisions. Related Control(s): IA-3, IA-4, IA-5, SC-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing service identification and authentication; system security plan;
  system design documentation; security safeguards used to identify and
  authenticate system services; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system operations
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers;
  organizational personnel with identification and authentication
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Security safeguards implementing service identification
  and authentication capabilities].
