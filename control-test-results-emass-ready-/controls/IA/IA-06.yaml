control-information: >-
  Description:

  Obscure feedback of authentication information during the authentication
  process to protect the information from possible exploitation and use by
  unauthorized individuals.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Authentication feedback from systems does not provide information that would
  allow unauthorized individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For
  some types of systems, such as desktops or notebooks with relatively large
  monitors, the threat (referred to as shoulder surfing) may be significant. For
  other types of systems, such as mobile devices with small displays, the threat
  may be less significant and is balanced against the increased likelihood of
  typographic input errors due to small keyboards. Thus, the means for obscuring
  authentication feedback is selected accordingly. Obscuring authentication
  feedback includes displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input
  devices or displaying feedback for a very limited time before obscuring it.
  Related Control(s): AC-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; system
  security plan; procedures addressing authenticator feedback; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the obscuring of
  feedback of authentication information during authentication].

test-results: UDS does not reveal sensitive info during login (like not telling
  which part of the credential was wrong). Keycloak’s behavior by default is to
  present generic error messages such as “Invalid username or password” on a
  failed login, which does not specifically indicate if the username exists or
  not. This prevents an attacker from enumerating valid usernames. Also, when
  MFA is involved, Keycloak errors are careful not to divulge unnecessary
  detail. The UDS stack’s UIs do not expose password characters (they mask
  input) and do not echo back any secret info.
