control-acronym: "[r5] IA-08(02)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Accept only external authenticators that are NIST-compliant; and

  (b) Document and maintain a list of accepted external authenticators.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Acceptance of only NIST-compliant external authenticators applies to
  organizational systems that are accessible to the public (e.g., public-facing
  websites). External authenticators are issued by nonfederal government
  entities and are compliant with SP 800-63B. Approved external authenticators
  meet or exceed the minimum Federal Government-wide technical, security,
  privacy, and organizational maturity requirements. Meeting or exceeding
  Federal requirements allows Federal Government relying parties to trust
  external authenticators in connection with an authentication transaction at a
  specified authenticator assurance level. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; system
  security plan; procedures addressing user identification and authentication;
  system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system audit records; list of third-party credentialing
  products, components, or services procured and implemented by organization;
  third-party credential verification records; evidence of third-party
  credentials; third-party credential authorizations; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system operations
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers;
  organizational personnel with account management responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing identification
  and authentication capabilities; mechanisms that accept external credentials].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: IA-8(2).1; as well
  as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-004083. The resulting
  compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following Rev. 4
  assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance statement:
  IA-8(2).1. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because of
  the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that
  has not been previously assessed: CCI-004083.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS employs the Keycloak identity
  management component, which supports authentication integration with
  FICAM-approved identity and credentialing solutions, including DoD-approved
  PKI (such as CAC and PIV) and other FICAM-approved external credential
  providers. Keycloak itself provides the necessary technical capabilitiesâ€”such
  as certificate-based authentication, validation, and federation with approved
  identity providers to meet FICAM compliance requirements. However, explicit
  verification and formal documentation of Keycloak as a FICAM-approved
  component, or integrating it explicitly with approved FICAM-compliant identity
  services, remain organizational responsibilities.)
