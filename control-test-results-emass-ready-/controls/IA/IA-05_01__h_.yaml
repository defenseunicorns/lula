control-information: >-
  Description:

  For password-based authentication:

  (a) Maintain a list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords and
  update the list [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and when
  organizational passwords are suspected to have been compromised directly or
  indirectly;

  (b) Verify, when users create or update passwords, that the passwords are not
  found on the list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords in
  IA-5(1)(a);

  (c) Transmit passwords only over cryptographically-protected channels;

  (d) Store passwords using an approved salted key derivation function,
  preferably using a keyed hash;

  (e) Require immediate selection of a new password upon account recovery;

  (f) Allow user selection of long passwords and passphrases, including spaces
  and all printable characters;

  (g) Employ automated tools to assist the user in selecting strong password
  authenticators; and

  (h) Enforce the following composition and complexity rules: [Assignment:
  organization-defined composition and complexity rules].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Password-based authentication applies to passwords regardless of whether they
  are used in single-factor or multi-factor authentication. Long passwords or
  passphrases are preferable over shorter passwords. Enforced composition rules
  provide marginal security benefits while decreasing usability. However,
  organizations may choose to establish certain rules for password generation
  (e.g., minimum character length for long passwords) under certain
  circumstances and can enforce this requirement in IA-5(1)(h). Account recovery
  can occur, for example, in situations when a password is forgotten.
  Cryptographically protected passwords include salted one-way cryptographic
  hashes of passwords. The list of commonly used, compromised, or expected
  passwords includes passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses,
  dictionary words, and repetitive or sequential characters. The list includes
  context-specific words, such as the name of the service, username, and
  derivatives thereof. Related Control(s): IA-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; password
  policy; procedures addressing authenticator management; system security plan;
  system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; password configurations and associated documentation; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with authenticator
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing password-based
  authenticator management capability].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: IA-5(1).1,
  IA-5(1).2, IA-5(1).3, IA-5(1).4, IA-5(1).5, IA-5(1).6, IA-5(1).7, IA-5(1).8,

  IA-5(1).19; as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-004066,
  CCI-004067. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test
  result/compliance statement: IA-5(1).14. The resulting compliance status was
  set to non-compliant because of the addition of a new security requirement to
  the assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed: CCI-004066,
  CCI-004067.


  UDS enforces password complexity requirements, including specifying a minimum
  number of uppercase characters, through its integrated identity management
  solution, Keycloak. Administrators can explicitly configure Keycloak password
  policies to mandate a minimum required number of uppercase letters, ensuring
  adherence to organizational security standards. Keycloak automatically
  enforces these password complexity rules during password creation and changes,
  rejecting passwords that fail to meet defined complexity requirements. 

  UDS enforces password complexity requirements regarding the minimum number of
  lowercase characters through its centralized identity management solution,
  Keycloak. Administrators can configure Keycloak to mandate specific password
  complexity parameters, including enforcing a minimum number of lowercase
  characters. When users create or modify passwords, Keycloak automatically
  evaluates the passwords against these defined complexity rules, rejecting any
  passwords that fail to comply.

  UDS enforces minimum password length requirements through centralized identity
  management provided by Keycloak. Keycloak enables administrators to define
  specific password complexity requirements, explicitly including a minimum
  password length. When users create or modify their passwords, Keycloak
  automatically verifies the passwords against these established complexity
  policies, rejecting any that fail to meet the defined minimum length. 

  UDS enforces password complexity requirements, including the minimum number of
  numeric characters, through its centralized identity management solution,
  Keycloak. Keycloak provides configurable password complexity rules that allow
  administrators to explicitly define the required minimum number of numeric
  characters. When users set or change their passwords, Keycloak automatically
  enforces these rules, rejecting any passwords that fail to comply with the
  organization's defined numeric character requirements. 

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.

  UDS enforces password complexity requirements, including specifying a minimum
  number of special characters, through its centralized identity management
  solution, Keycloak. Keycloak allows administrators to define password
  complexity rules explicitly, including enforcing a minimum number of special
  characters. During password creation or modification, Keycloak automatically
  validates user-provided passwords against these defined complexity criteria
  and rejects any password that does not meet the required minimum
  special-character threshold. 

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS utilizes Keycloak for identity
  and access management, supporting comprehensive password policy enforcement.
  However, Keycloak's built-in password policy features do not explicitly
  enforce a minimum password lifetime (e.g., preventing users from changing
  passwords before a defined minimum period).)

  UDS enforces maximum password lifetime restrictions through its integrated
  identity management solution, Keycloak. Keycloak provides configurable
  password policies allowing administrators to define explicit maximum password
  lifetimes (e.g., 60 or 90 days). Upon expiration of the maximum password
  lifetime, Keycloak automatically prompts users to change their passwords,
  effectively preventing indefinite use of potentially compromised credentials.
