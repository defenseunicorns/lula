control-acronym: "[r5] IA-12(04)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Require that the validation and verification of identity evidence be conducted
  in person before a designated registration authority.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  In-person proofing reduces the likelihood of fraudulent credentials being
  issued because it requires the physical presence of individuals, the
  presentation of physical identity documents, and actual face-to-face
  interactions with designated registration authorities. Related Control(s):
  None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing identity proofing; system security plan; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system operations
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers;
  organizational personnel with identification and authentication
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing identification
  and authentication capabilities].
