control-acronym: "[r5] IA-12(02)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Require evidence of individual identification be presented to the registration
  authority.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Identity evidence, such as documentary evidence or a combination of documents
  and biometrics, reduces the likelihood of individuals using fraudulent
  identification to establish an identity or at least increases the work factor
  of potential adversaries. The forms of acceptable evidence are consistent with
  the risks to the systems, roles, and privileges associated with the userâ€™s
  account. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing identity proofing; system security plan; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system operations
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers;
  organizational personnel with identification and authentication
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing identification
  and authentication capabilities].
