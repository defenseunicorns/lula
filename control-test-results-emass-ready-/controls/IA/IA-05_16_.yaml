  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing identifier management; system security plan; system design
  documentation; mechanisms providing dynamic binding of identifiers and
  authenticators; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with identification and
  authentication management responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing account
