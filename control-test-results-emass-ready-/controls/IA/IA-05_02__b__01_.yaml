  Description:

  (a) For public key-based authentication:

  (1) Enforce authorized access to the corresponding private key; and

  (2) Map the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group;
  and

  (b) When public key infrastructure (PKI) is used:

  (1) Validate certificates by constructing and verifying a certification path
  to an accepted trust anchor, including checking certificate status
  information; and

  (2) Implement a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and
  validation.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Public key cryptography is a valid authentication mechanism for individuals,
  machines, and devices. For PKI solutions, status information for certification
  paths includes certificate revocation lists or certificate status protocol
  responses. For PIV cards, certificate validation involves the construction and
  verification of a certification path to the Common Policy Root trust anchor,
  which includes certificate policy processing. Implementing a local cache of
  revocation data to support path discovery and validation also supports system
  availability in situations where organizations are unable to access revocation
  information via the network. Related Control(s): IA-3, SC-17.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

test-results: UDS employs robust Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)-based
  authentication validation through its centralized identity management
  solution, Keycloak. Keycloak is technically configured to authenticate users
  via hardware token-based credentials such as DoD-approved Common Access Card
  (CAC) and Personal Identity Verification (PIV) certificates. Keycloak
  validates these certificates in compliance with RFC 5280, including explicit
  construction and verification of certificate trust paths up to established,
  trusted DoD certificate authorities. Additionally, Keycloak performs real-time
  revocation checks through Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and/or Online
  Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) services, ensuring immediate detection of
  revoked or compromised certificates.
