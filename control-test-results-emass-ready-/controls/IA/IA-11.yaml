control-information: >-
  Description:

  Require users to re-authenticate when [Assignment: organization-defined
  circumstances or situations requiring re-authentication].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  In addition to the re-authentication requirements associated with device
  locks, organizations may require re-authentication of individuals in certain
  situations, including when roles, authenticators or credentials change, when
  security categories of systems change, when the execution of privileged
  functions occurs, after a fixed time period, or periodically. Related
  Control(s): AC-3, AC-11, IA-2, IA-3, IA-4, IA-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing user and device re-authentication; system security plan; system
  design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; list of circumstances or situations requiring
  re-authentication; system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system operations
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers;
  organizational personnel with identification and authentication
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing identification
  and authentication capabilities].
