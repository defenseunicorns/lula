control-acronym: "[r5] IA-04"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Manage system identifiers by:

  a. Receiving authorization from [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
  roles] to assign an individual, group, role, service, or device identifier;

  b. Selecting an identifier that identifies an individual, group, role,
  service, or device;

  c. Assigning the identifier to the intended individual, group, role, service,
  or device; and

  d. Preventing reuse of identifiers for [Assignment: organization-defined time
  period].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Common device identifiers include Media Access Control (MAC) addresses,
  Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. The
  management of individual identifiers is not applicable to shared system
  accounts. Typically, individual identifiers are the usernames of the system
  accounts assigned to those individuals. In such instances, the account
  management activities of AC-2 use account names provided by IA-4. Identifier
  management also addresses individual identifiers not necessarily associated
  with system accounts. Preventing the reuse of identifiers implies preventing
  the assignment of previously used individual, group, role, service, or device
  identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, services, or devices.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing identifier management; procedures addressing account management;
  system security plan; system design documentation; system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; list of system accounts; list of
  identifiers generated from physical access control devices; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with identifier management
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing identifier
  management].

  Identifier management is essentially how the system manages user IDs and other
  identifiers (like service account names). UDS provides centralized identity
  management via Keycloak for users. When a new user needs to be created, an
  administrator uses Keycloak’s console to create a unique username (or it’s
  federated from an external directory to ensure corporate uniqueness). Keycloak
  prevents duplicate usernames in a realm, ensuring uniqueness. It also allows
  assignment of attributes like email, employee ID, etc., to clearly identify
  individuals. For service accounts, Kubernetes ensures each service account has
  a unique name within its namespace and a unique token. The provisioning and
  de-provisioning of accounts is all done through controlled interfaces
  (Keycloak admin for users, kubectl or IaC for service accounts), and those
  actions can be tied into workflows. When a user leaves, disabling or deleting
  their Keycloak account removes their access across all integrated apps. These
  mechanisms align with IA-4’s intent by providing central control over identity
  lifecycle: only admins can create/delete accounts, accounts are unique and
  tied to individuals, and removing access is one centralized step.
