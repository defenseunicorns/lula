  Description:

  Require that the presented identity evidence be validated and verified through
  [Assignment: organizational defined methods of validation and verification].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Validation and verification of identity evidence increases the assurance that
  accounts and identifiers are being established for the correct user and
  authenticators are being bound to that user. Validation refers to the process
  of confirming that the evidence is genuine and authentic, and the data
  contained in the evidence is correct, current, and related to an individual.
  Verification confirms and establishes a linkage between the claimed identity
  and the actual existence of the user presenting the evidence. Acceptable
  methods for validating and verifying identity evidence are consistent with the
  risks to the systems, roles, and privileges associated with the users account.
  Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing identity proofing; system security plan; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system operations
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers;
  organizational personnel with identification and authentication
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing identification
  and authentication capabilities].
