control-acronym: "[r5] IA-04"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Manage system identifiers by:

  a. Receiving authorization from [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
  roles] to assign an individual, group, role, service, or device identifier;

  b. Selecting an identifier that identifies an individual, group, role,
  service, or device;

  c. Assigning the identifier to the intended individual, group, role, service,
  or device; and

  d. Preventing reuse of identifiers for [Assignment: organization-defined time
  period].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Common device identifiers include Media Access Control (MAC) addresses,
  Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. The
  management of individual identifiers is not applicable to shared system
  accounts. Typically, individual identifiers are the usernames of the system
  accounts assigned to those individuals. In such instances, the account
  management activities of AC-2 use account names provided by IA-4. Identifier
  management also addresses individual identifiers not necessarily associated
  with system accounts. Preventing the reuse of identifiers implies preventing
  the assignment of previously used individual, group, role, service, or device
  identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, services, or devices.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing identifier management; procedures addressing account management;
  system security plan; system design documentation; system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; list of system accounts; list of
  identifiers generated from physical access control devices; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with identifier management
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing identifier
  management].

  UDS manages user and system identifiers through its identity management system
  Keycloak, which inherently ensures uniqueness of user identifiers (usernames,
  UUIDs, or other unique IDs) and prevents reuse upon account deletion or user
  departure. Although Keycloak inherently enforces unique identifier assignments
  and prevents immediate reuse, configuring a specific organizationally defined
  non-reuse period (e.g., one year) for identifiers is an administrative
  control. Typically an account is marked as disable vs deleted for auditing
  purposes and while an account is in disabled mode this will prevent the reuse
  indefinitely. 

  UDS meets the requirement to disable information system identifiers after 35
  days of inactivity through its centralized identity management solution,
  Keycloak. Specifically, Keycloak provides built-in session and account
  lifecycle management capabilities, allowing administrators to configure
  inactivity thresholds directly within its administrative interface. Upon
  reaching the configured inactivity period (35 days, per organizational
  policy), Keycloak automatically disables or locks user accounts, preventing
  access until reactivation by an authorized administrator. Additionally,
  Keycloak maintains detailed audit logs of account status changes, ensuring
  traceability and accountability. This mechanism ensures compliance with the
  organization's defined inactivity requirements and effectively reduces risks
  associated with dormant accounts.
