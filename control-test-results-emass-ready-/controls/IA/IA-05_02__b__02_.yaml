  Description:

  (a) For public key-based authentication:

  (1) Enforce authorized access to the corresponding private key; and

  (2) Map the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group;
  and

  (b) When public key infrastructure (PKI) is used:

  (1) Validate certificates by constructing and verifying a certification path
  to an accepted trust anchor, including checking certificate status
  information; and

  (2) Implement a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and
  validation.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Public key cryptography is a valid authentication mechanism for individuals,
  machines, and devices. For PKI solutions, status information for certification
  paths includes certificate revocation lists or certificate status protocol
  responses. For PIV cards, certificate validation involves the construction and
  verification of a certification path to the Common Policy Root trust anchor,
  which includes certificate policy processing. Implementing a local cache of
  revocation data to support path discovery and validation also supports system
  availability in situations where organizations are unable to access revocation
  information via the network. Related Control(s): IA-3, SC-17.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: IA-5(2).4; as well
  as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-004068. The resulting
  compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following Rev. 4
  assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance statement:
  IA-5(2).4. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because of
  the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that
  has not been previously assessed: CCI-004068.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS through its integrated identity
  management solution (Keycloak), supports PKI-based authentication using
  DoD-approved certificates (e.g., CAC/PIV) and inherently provides capabilities
  for certificate revocation checking via Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or
  Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). However, Keycloak by default relies
  primarily on live network-based checks (e.g., OCSP responders or CRLs via
  external URLs) and does not natively maintain an internal local cache of
  revocation data. To fully meet this control, the deploying organization should
  explicitly configure local caching mechanisms or implement intermediate
  caching proxies that periodically retrieve and locally store CRL data.
  Although technically achievable within UDS deployments via external
  configuration (such as proxying OCSP responders or local CRL caches), explicit
  local caching and periodic refresh of revocation data must be established by
  the organization as part of the deployment architecture.)
