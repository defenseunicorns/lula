control-acronym: "[r5] IA-08"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Uniquely identify and authenticate non-organizational users or processes
  acting on behalf of non-organizational users.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Non-organizational users include system users other than organizational users
  explicitly covered by IA-2. Non-organizational users are uniquely identified
  and authenticated for accesses other than those explicitly identified and
  documented in AC-14. Identification and authentication of non-organizational
  users accessing federal systems may be required to protect federal,
  proprietary, or privacy-related information (with exceptions noted for
  national security systems). Organizations consider many factors—including
  security, privacy, scalability, and practicality—when balancing the need to
  ensure ease of use for access to federal information and systems with the need
  to protect and adequately mitigate risk. Related Control(s): AC-2, AC-6,
  AC-14, AC-17, AC-18, AU-6, IA-2, IA-4, IA-5, IA-10, IA-11, MA-4, RA-3, SA-4,
  SC-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; system
  security plan; privacy plan; procedures addressing user identification and
  authentication; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; system audit records; list of system accounts; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system operations
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with account management responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing identification
  and authentication capabilities].

test-results: "Identification and authentication of non-organizational users
  (e.g., guest users, federation partners) can be handled by UDS through
  Keycloak. Keycloak supports setting up separate user realms or groups for
  external users and applying different authentication requirements to them. For
  instance, if external partner users need to access a certain application, they
  can be put in a separate realm or marked with an attribute, and Keycloak can
  enforce that they use their own credentials or an agreed federation (such as
  logging in via their home organization’s IdP which Keycloak trusts).
  Keycloak’s identity brokering capability​ is very useful here: UDS can accept
  identities from external identity providers (e.g. SAML/OIDC provider) without
  issuing local accounts, meaning external users are authenticated via their
  organization but still identified to UDS."
