control-acronym: "[r5] IA-12"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Identity proof users that require accounts for logical access to systems
  based on appropriate identity assurance level requirements as specified in
  applicable standards and guidelines;

  b. Resolve user identities to a unique individual; and

  c. Collect, validate, and verify identity evidence.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Identity proofing is the process of collecting, validating, and verifying a
  userâ€™s identity information for the purposes of establishing credentials for
  accessing a system. Identity proofing is intended to mitigate threats to the
  registration of users and the establishment of their accounts. Standards and
  guidelines specifying identity assurance levels for identity proofing include
  SP 800-63-3 and SP 800-63A. Organizations may be subject to laws, executive
  orders, directives, regulations, or policies that address the collection of
  identity evidence. Organizational personnel consult with the senior agency
  official for privacy and legal counsel regarding such requirements. Related
  Control(s): AC-5, IA-1, IA-2, IA-3, IA-4, IA-5, IA-6, IA-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing identity proofing; system security plan; privacy plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system operations
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities; legal counsel; system/network administrators; system
  developers; organizational personnel with identification and authentication
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing identification
  and authentication capabilities].
