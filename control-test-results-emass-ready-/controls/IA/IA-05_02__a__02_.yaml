  Description:

  (a) For public key-based authentication:

  (1) Enforce authorized access to the corresponding private key; and

  (2) Map the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group;
  and

  (b) When public key infrastructure (PKI) is used:

  (1) Validate certificates by constructing and verifying a certification path
  to an accepted trust anchor, including checking certificate status
  information; and

  (2) Implement a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and
  validation.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Public key cryptography is a valid authentication mechanism for individuals,
  machines, and devices. For PKI solutions, status information for certification
  paths includes certificate revocation lists or certificate status protocol
  responses. For PIV cards, certificate validation involves the construction and
  verification of a certification path to the Common Policy Root trust anchor,
  which includes certificate policy processing. Implementing a local cache of
  revocation data to support path discovery and validation also supports system
  availability in situations where organizations are unable to access revocation
  information via the network. Related Control(s): IA-3, SC-17.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing authenticator management; system security plan; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation; PKI
  certification validation records; PKI certification revocation lists; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with PKI-based,
  authenticator management responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system
  developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing PKI-based,
  authenticator management capability].

test-results: UDS effectively maps authenticated PKI credentials to user
  accounts through its centralized identity management system, Keycloak, fully
  aligning with DoDI 8520.03 requirements. When users authenticate using
  PKI-based credentials (e.g., CAC or PIV), Keycloak validates the presented
  X.509 certificate and automatically maps the validated certificate identity to
  a corresponding, pre-established user account or role within the system. This
  mapping process ensures users receive appropriate permissions and role-based
  access control (RBAC) privileges in accordance with their assigned
  organizational roles. Additionally, Keycloak maintains detailed audit logs of
  successful and unsuccessful authentications and mappings, facilitating
  traceability and compliance auditing.
