control-information: >-
  Description:

  For PKI-based authentication, employ an organization-wide methodology for
  managing the content of PKI trust stores installed across all platforms,
  including networks, operating systems, browsers, and applications.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  An organization-wide methodology for managing the content of PKI trust stores
  helps improve the accuracy and currency of PKI-based authentication
  credentials across the organization. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing authenticator management; system security plan; organizational
  methodology for managing content of PKI trust stores across installed all
  platforms; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; enterprise security architecture documentation;
  enterprise architecture documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with authenticator
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing PKI-based
  authenticator management capability; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  the PKI trust store capability].
