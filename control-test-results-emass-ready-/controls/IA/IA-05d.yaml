  Description:

  Manage system authenticators by:

  a. Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity
  of the individual, group, role, service, or device receiving the
  authenticator;

  b. Establishing initial authenticator content for any authenticators issued by
  the organization;

  c. Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for
  their intended use;

  d. Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial
  authenticator distribution, for lost or compromised or damaged authenticators,
  and for revoking authenticators;

  e. Changing default authenticators prior to first use;

  f. Changing or refreshing authenticators [Assignment: organization-defined
  time period by authenticator type] or when [Assignment: organization-defined
  events] occur;

  g. Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and
  modification;

  h. Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific
  controls to protect authenticators; and

  i. Changing authenticators for group or role accounts when membership to those
  accounts changes.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Authenticators include passwords, cryptographic devices, biometrics,
  certificates, one-time password devices, and ID badges. Device authenticators
  include certificates and passwords. Initial authenticator content is the
  actual content of the authenticator (e.g., the initial password). In contrast,
  the requirements for authenticator content contain specific criteria or
  characteristics (e.g., minimum password length). Developers may deliver system
  components with factory default authentication credentials (i.e., passwords)
  to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication
  credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, and present a
  significant risk. The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be
  implemented via control PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of
  individuals and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators stored in
  organizational systems, including passwords stored in hashed or encrypted
  formats or files containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with
  administrator privileges.


  Systems support authenticator management by organization-defined settings and
  restrictions for various authenticator characteristics (e.g., minimum password
  length, validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and
  number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric
  authentication). Actions can be taken to safeguard individual authenticators,
  including maintaining possession of authenticators, not sharing authenticators
  with others, and immediately reporting lost, stolen, or compromised
  authenticators. Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking
  authenticators for temporary access when no longer needed. Related Control(s):

  SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  UDS provides robust technical capabilities for secure authenticator
  distribution through its integrated identity management solution, Keycloak.
  Keycloak enforces secure authenticator provisioning, allowing organizations to
  manage initial distribution securely using methods such as cryptographically
  protected links, temporary passwords, or integration with DoD-approved
  credentialing systems like CAC/PIV.

  UDS provides comprehensive technical capabilities to manage lost or
  compromised authenticators through its identity management solution, Keycloak.
  Keycloak enables administrators to immediately revoke, disable, or reset user
  authenticators upon notification or detection of compromise, and it supports
  detailed auditing and logging to track authenticator management actions. 

  UDS provides comprehensive technical capabilities to manage authenticators
  through its integrated identity management solution, Keycloak, allowing
  administrators to promptly revoke, disable, or re-issue damaged or compromised
  authenticators (e.g., tokens, passwords, MFA methods). Keycloak's
  administrative console enables rapid remediation actions, such as
  authenticator reset or re-provisioning, ensuring minimal disruption. 

  UDS platform provides robust technical support for secure initial
  authenticator distribution through its identity management solution, Keycloak.
  Keycloak facilitates secure and controlled provisioning of authenticators,
  such as temporary passwords, multifactor authentication tokens, or CAC/PIV
  credential integration. The solution ensures authenticators are generated
  securely, distributed confidentially, and require secure initial enrollment
  processes (e.g., mandatory password resets or MFA enrollment upon first
  login).

  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: IA-5.4, IA-5.5, IA-5.6, IA-5.7, IA-5.8, IA-5.9, IA-5.10, IA-5.11;
