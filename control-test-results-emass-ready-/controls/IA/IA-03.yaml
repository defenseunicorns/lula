control-acronym: "[r5] IA-03"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Uniquely identify and authenticate [Assignment: organization-defined devices
  and/or types of devices] before establishing a [Selection (one or more):
  local; remote; network] connection.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Devices that require unique device-to-device identification and authentication
  are defined by type, device, or a combination of type and device.
  Organization-defined device types include devices that are not owned by the
  organization. Systems use shared known information (e.g., Media Access Control
  [MAC], Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol [TCP/IP] addresses) for
  device identification or organizational authentication solutions (e.g.,
  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.1x and Extensible
  Authentication Protocol [EAP], RADIUS server with EAP-Transport Layer Security
  [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to identify and authenticate devices on local
  and wide area networks. Organizations determine the required strength of
  authentication mechanisms based on the security categories of systems and
  mission or business requirements. Because of the challenges of implementing
  device authentication on a large scale, organizations can restrict the
  application of the control to a limited number/type of devices based on
  mission or business needs. Related Control(s): AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, AU-6,
  CA-3, CA-9, IA-4, IA-5, IA-9, IA-11, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; system
  security plan; procedures addressing device identification and authentication;
  system design documentation; list of devices requiring unique identification
  and authentication; device connection reports; system configuration settings
  and associated documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with operational
  responsibilities for device identification and authentication; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system/network
  administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing device
  identification and authentication capabilities].

  Device authentication is handled in UDS through mutual TLS and
  certificate-based trust between components. Each server/node in the Kubernetes
  cluster has its own credentials (certificates for the kubelet, etc.) and each
  service in the service mesh has a certificate identity (issued by Istio’s
  Citadel). These certificates are used to authenticate machines and services to
  each other. For example, when Service A connects to Service B within the mesh,
  it presents its certificate and B’s sidecar verifies it only if it’s a valid
  known service cert will communication proceed. This means that devices and
  applications are being authenticated at the network layer without user
  involvement.
