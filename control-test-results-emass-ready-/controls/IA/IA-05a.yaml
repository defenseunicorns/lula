  Description:

  Manage system authenticators by:

  a. Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity
  of the individual, group, role, service, or device receiving the
  authenticator;

  b. Establishing initial authenticator content for any authenticators issued by
  the organization;

  c. Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for
  their intended use;

  d. Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial
  authenticator distribution, for lost or compromised or damaged authenticators,
  and for revoking authenticators;

  e. Changing default authenticators prior to first use;

  f. Changing or refreshing authenticators [Assignment: organization-defined
  time period by authenticator type] or when [Assignment: organization-defined
  events] occur;

  g. Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and
  modification;

  h. Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific
  controls to protect authenticators; and

  i. Changing authenticators for group or role accounts when membership to those
  accounts changes.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Authenticators include passwords, cryptographic devices, biometrics,
  certificates, one-time password devices, and ID badges. Device authenticators
  include certificates and passwords. Initial authenticator content is the
  actual content of the authenticator (e.g., the initial password). In contrast,
  the requirements for authenticator content contain specific criteria or
  characteristics (e.g., minimum password length). Developers may deliver system
  components with factory default authentication credentials (i.e., passwords)
  to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication
  credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, and present a
  significant risk. The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be
  implemented via control PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of
  individuals and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators stored in
  organizational systems, including passwords stored in hashed or encrypted
  formats or files containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with
  administrator privileges.


  Systems support authenticator management by organization-defined settings and
  restrictions for various authenticator characteristics (e.g., minimum password
  length, validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and
  number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric
  authentication). Actions can be taken to safeguard individual authenticators,
  including maintaining possession of authenticators, not sharing authenticators
  with others, and immediately reporting lost, stolen, or compromised
  authenticators. Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking
  authenticators for temporary access when no longer needed. Related Control(s):

  SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  security plan; addressing authenticator management; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  list of system authenticator types; change control records associated with
  managing system authenticators; system audit records; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with authenticator
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing authenticator

test-results: UDS supports secure initial authenticator distribution and
  identity verification through its centralized identity management solution,
  Keycloak. Keycloak enforces strong initial user identification by integrating
  with established identity providers, such as DoD-approved CAC/PIV
  infrastructure, to ensure robust identity verification prior to authenticator
  issuance. Users must authenticate initially with verified, cryptographically
  secure credentials before receiving authenticators like OTP tokens or access
  credentials. However, formal identity verification procedures, including
  in-person verification or explicit organizational procedures, remain an
  organizational responsibility.
