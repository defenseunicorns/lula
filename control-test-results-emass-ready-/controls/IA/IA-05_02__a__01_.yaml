  Description:

  (a) For public key-based authentication:

  (1) Enforce authorized access to the corresponding private key; and

  (2) Map the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group;
  and

  (b) When public key infrastructure (PKI) is used:

  (1) Validate certificates by constructing and verifying a certification path
  to an accepted trust anchor, including checking certificate status
  information; and

  (2) Implement a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and
  validation.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Public key cryptography is a valid authentication mechanism for individuals,
  machines, and devices. For PKI solutions, status information for certification
  paths includes certificate revocation lists or certificate status protocol
  responses. For PIV cards, certificate validation involves the construction and
  verification of a certification path to the Common Policy Root trust anchor,
  which includes certificate policy processing. Implementing a local cache of
  revocation data to support path discovery and validation also supports system
  availability in situations where organizations are unable to access revocation
  information via the network. Related Control(s): IA-3, SC-17.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing authenticator management; system security plan; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation; PKI
  certification validation records; PKI certification revocation lists; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with PKI-based,
  authenticator management responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system
  developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing PKI-based,
  authenticator management capability].

compliance-status: Compliant
test-results: UDS complies fully with DoD requirements for private key storage
  and access protections through its integrated PKI-based authentication
  mechanisms provided by Keycloak. Users authenticate using DoD-approved
  hardware tokens, such as Common Access Cards (CAC) or Personal Identity
  Verification (PIV) cards, wherein private keys are securely stored in
  cryptographic containers that enforce strict hardware-based access controls.
  These smart cards ensure that private keys never leave the secure hardware
  boundary and cannot be exported or accessed directly by UDS or Keycloak
  systems. Access to these keys is strictly limited to the authorized user, who
  must provide activation data (e.g., PIN) directly into their hardware token.
