  Description:

  Implement multi-factor authentication for access to privileged accounts.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Multi-factor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors
  to achieve authentication. The authentication factors are defined as follows:
  something you know (e.g., a personal identification number [PIN]), something
  you have (e.g., a physical authenticator such as a cryptographic private key),
  or something you are (e.g., a biometric). Multi-factor authentication
  solutions that feature physical authenticators include hardware authenticators
  that provide time-based or challenge-response outputs and smart cards such as
  the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card or the
  Department of Defense (DoD) Common Access Card (CAC). In addition to
  authenticating users at the system level (i.e., at logon), organizations may
  employ authentication mechanisms at the application level, at their
  discretion, to provide increased security. Regardless of the type of access
  (i.e., local, network, remote), privileged accounts are authenticated using
  multi-factor options appropriate for the level of risk. Organizations can add
  additional security measures, such as additional or more rigorous
  authentication mechanisms, for specific types of access. Related Control(s):
  AC-5, AC-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: IA-2(1).1,
  IA-2(3).1, IA-5(11).1, IA-5(11).2. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally
  entered test result/compliance statement: IA-2(3).1.


  Keycloak supports MFA (such as OTP, mobile push, or U2F keys), and
  administrators can enforce that any user with admin roles must use MFA to
  login. It’s straightforward to configure a realm such that realm
  administrators or any user in a privileged group must perform an extra
  authentication step (for example, Keycloak can be set up to require a one-time
  password from an authenticator app after password entry for admins). Given
  that privileged users (like cluster admins, Keycloak admins) would
  authenticate via Keycloak as well with a CAC, this meets the requirement that
  these accounts use MFA for network access.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (This enhancement involves
  multi-factor for local access (like console access to a server). In the
  context of UDS, there is no “local” login to an application all access to UDS
  services is over the network. The underlying host machines (nodes of the
  Kubernetes cluster) are not considered part of the UDS application stack from
  a user perspective; those are managed by sysadmins with their own OS login
  controls (likely using SSH keys, etc., which indeed can be multi-factor if
  using PIV cards). But that’s outside of UDS. UDS itself doesn’t have an
  interactive local console for users.)

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.

  In UDS, token-based authentication is engineered to meet organization-defined
  token quality requirements by enforcing the use of only DoD-approved PKI
  credentials. Keycloak is configured to accept and validate certificates in
  accordance with DoDI 8520.02 and DoDI 8520.03. For unclassified systems, this
  means accepting DoD PKI credentials, External Certification Authority (ECA)
  PKI credentials, and other DoD-approved external PKI credentials, while for
  SIPRNet deployments only DoD PKI and NSS PKI credentials are permitted. When
  external PKI credentials are accepted, Keycloak verifies that the certificate
  includes the required Certificate Policy Object Identifiers (OIDs) that
  represent approved assurance levels. Additionally, Istio’s mutual TLS is used
  to secure service-to-service communications by ensuring that only tokens
  derived from these validated certificates are accepted.
