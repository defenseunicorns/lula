control-acronym: "[r5] IA-05(13)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Prohibit the use of cached authenticators after [Assignment:
  organization-defined time period].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Cached authenticators are used to authenticate to the local machine when the
  network is not available. If cached authentication information is out of date,
  the validity of the authentication information may be questionable. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing authenticator management; system security plan; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with authenticator
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing authenticator
  management capability].

  In UDS, cached authenticators (such as session tokens) are automatically
  invalidated after the organization-defined time period. For example, Keycloak
  issues JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) with a set expiration time that strictly limits
  their validity. Once that period elapses, even if the token is cached locally,
  the system rejects its use and requires re-authentication or a token refresh.
  Additionally, service-to-service communications managed by Istio enforce
  similar expiration policies on cached authentication credentials used in
  mutual TLS sessions.
