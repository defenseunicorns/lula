  Description:

  Protect authenticators commensurate with the security category of the
  information to which use of the authenticator permits access.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  For systems that contain multiple security categories of information without
  reliable physical or logical separation between categories, authenticators
  used to grant access to the systems are protected commensurate with the
  highest security category of information on the systems. Security categories
  of information are determined as part of the security categorization process.
  Related Control(s): RA-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing authenticator management; security categorization documentation for
  the system; security assessments of authenticator protections; risk assessment
  results; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with authenticator
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel implementing and/or
  maintaining authenticator protections; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing authenticator
  management capability; mechanisms protecting authenticators].
