control-acronym: "[r5] IA-08(04)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Conform to the following profiles for identity management [Assignment:
  organization-defined identity management profiles].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations define profiles for identity management based on open identity
  management standards. To ensure that open identity management standards are
  viable, robust, reliable, sustainable, and interoperable as documented, the
  Federal Government assesses and scopes the standards and technology
  implementations against applicable laws, executive orders, directives,
  policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; system
  security plan; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system operations
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers;
  organizational personnel with account management responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing identification
  and authentication capabilities; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  conformance with profiles].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: IA-8(4).1; as well
  as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-004085, CCI-004086. The
  resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following
  Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance
  statement: IA-8(4).1. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant
  because of the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment
  procedure that has not been previously assessed: CCI-004085, CCI-004086.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS employs the Keycloak identity
  management component, which supports authentication integration with
  FICAM-approved identity and credentialing solutions, including DoD-approved
  PKI (such as CAC and PIV) and other FICAM-approved external credential
  providers. Keycloak itself provides the necessary technical capabilitiesâ€”such
  as certificate-based authentication, validation, and federation with approved
  identity providers to meet FICAM compliance requirements. However, explicit
  verification and formal documentation of Keycloak as a FICAM-approved
  component, or integrating it explicitly with approved FICAM-compliant identity
  services, remain organizational responsibilities.)
