control-acronym: "[r5] IA-03(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Authenticate [Assignment: organization-defined devices and/or types of
  devices] before establishing [Selection (one or more): local; remote; network]
  connection using bidirectional authentication that is cryptographically based.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A local connection is a connection with a device that communicates without the
  use of a network. A network connection is a connection with a device that
  communicates through a network. A remote connection is a connection with a
  device that communicates through an external network. Bidirectional
  authentication provides stronger protection to validate the identity of other
  devices for connections that are of greater risk. Related Control(s): SC-8,
  SC-12, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; system
  security plan; procedures addressing device identification and authentication;
  system design documentation; list of devices requiring unique identification
  and authentication; device connection reports; system configuration settings
  and associated documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with operational
  responsibilities for device identification and authentication; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system/network
  administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing device
  authentication capability; cryptographically based bidirectional
  authentication mechanisms].

  Device authentication is handled in UDS through mutual TLS and
  certificate-based trust between components. Each server/node in the Kubernetes
  cluster has its own credentials (certificates for the kubelet, etc.) and each
  service in the service mesh has a certificate identity (issued by Istio’s
  Citadel). These certificates are used to authenticate machines and services to
  each other. For example, when Service A connects to Service B within the mesh,
  it presents its certificate and B’s sidecar verifies it only if it’s a valid
  known service cert will communication proceed. This means that devices and
  applications are being authenticated at the network layer without user
  involvement.
