control-information: >-
  Description:

  Implement [Assignment: organization-defined security controls] to manage the
  risk of compromise due to individuals having accounts on multiple systems.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  When individuals have accounts on multiple systems and use the same
  authenticators such as passwords, there is the risk that a compromise of one
  account may lead to the compromise of other accounts. Alternative approaches
  include having different authenticators (passwords) on all systems, employing
  a single sign-on or federation mechanism, or using some form of one-time
  passwords on all systems. Organizations can also use rules of behavior (see
  PL-4) and access agreements (see PS-6) to mitigate the risk of multiple system
  accounts. Related Control(s): PS-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing authenticator management; system security plan; list of individuals
  having accounts on multiple systems; list of security safeguards intended to
  manage risk of compromise due to individuals having accounts on multiple
  systems; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with authenticator
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing safeguards for
  authenticator management].

  UDS supports organizational efforts to manage risks associated with account
  use across multiple systems through its centralized identity management
  solution, Keycloak. Keycloak provides robust single sign-on (SSO) and
  federated authentication capabilities, ensuring centralized and consistent
  enforcement of authentication policies across connected systems. By leveraging
  federated identity services, UDS significantly reduces the likelihood of
  credential reuse and unauthorized account access.
