control-acronym: "[r5] IA-02(05)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  When shared accounts or authenticators are employed, require users to be
  individually authenticated before granting access to the shared accounts or
  resources.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Individual authentication prior to shared group authentication mitigates the
  risk of using group accounts or authenticators. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  security plan; procedures addressing user identification and authentication;

  documentation; system audit records; list of system accounts; other relevant
  documents or records].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: IA-2(5).1; as well
  as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-004045. The resulting
  compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following Rev. 4
  assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance statement:
  IA-2(5).1. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because of
  the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that
  has not been previously assessed: CCI-004045.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS utilizes individual-based
  authentication mechanisms exclusively through Keycloak, enforcing unique and
  traceable authentication credentials for each user account. Group
  authenticators, shared accounts, or shared authentication credentials are not
  supported or utilized within the UDS environment. Therefore, this control,
  which specifically addresses the requirement for individual authentication
  when group authenticators are in use, is not applicable to the provided UDS
  technology stack.)
