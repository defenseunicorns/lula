control-information: >-
  Description:

  Implement mechanisms for authentication to a cryptographic module that meet
  the requirements of applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies,
  regulations, standards, and guidelines for such authentication.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Authentication mechanisms may be required within a cryptographic module to
  authenticate an operator accessing the module and to verify that the operator
  is authorized to assume the requested role and perform services within that
  role. Related Control(s): AC-3, IA-5, SA-4, SC-12, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; system
  security plan; procedures addressing cryptographic module authentication;
  system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  cryptographic module authentication; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing cryptographic
  module authentication].

test-results: UDS components use cryptographic modules that meet federal
  standards (FIPS 140-2) when configured for secure environments. For example,
  Istio can be deployed with FIPS-validated crypto libraries, and the Linux
  operating environment can be in FIPS mode. Keycloak and other components
  support FIPS-compliant algorithms for TLS and hashing.
