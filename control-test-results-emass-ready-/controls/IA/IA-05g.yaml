  Description:

  Manage system authenticators by:

  a. Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity
  of the individual, group, role, service, or device receiving the
  authenticator;

  b. Establishing initial authenticator content for any authenticators issued by
  the organization;

  c. Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for
  their intended use;

  d. Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial
  authenticator distribution, for lost or compromised or damaged authenticators,
  and for revoking authenticators;

  e. Changing default authenticators prior to first use;

  f. Changing or refreshing authenticators [Assignment: organization-defined
  time period by authenticator type] or when [Assignment: organization-defined
  events] occur;

  g. Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and
  modification;

  h. Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific
  controls to protect authenticators; and

  i. Changing authenticators for group or role accounts when membership to those
  accounts changes.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Authenticators include passwords, cryptographic devices, biometrics,
  certificates, one-time password devices, and ID badges. Device authenticators
  include certificates and passwords. Initial authenticator content is the
  actual content of the authenticator (e.g., the initial password). In contrast,
  the requirements for authenticator content contain specific criteria or
  characteristics (e.g., minimum password length). Developers may deliver system
  components with factory default authentication credentials (i.e., passwords)
  to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication
  credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, and present a
  significant risk. The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be
  implemented via control PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of
  individuals and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators stored in
  organizational systems, including passwords stored in hashed or encrypted
  formats or files containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with
  administrator privileges.


  Systems support authenticator management by organization-defined settings and
  restrictions for various authenticator characteristics (e.g., minimum password
  length, validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and
  number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric
  authentication). Actions can be taken to safeguard individual authenticators,
  including maintaining possession of authenticators, not sharing authenticators
  with others, and immediately reporting lost, stolen, or compromised
  authenticators. Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking
  authenticators for temporary access when no longer needed. Related Control(s):

  SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: IA-5.15, IA-5.18,

  following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Reuse conditions must be managed by
  the organization. It is typically not recommend to reuse conditions.)

  In UDS, authenticator content is rigorously protected from unauthorized
  modification through a layered security approach. Credentials, tokens, and
  secrets are centrally managed using Keycloak and securely stored in Kubernetes
  Secrets, which are encrypted at rest and tightly controlled by RBAC policies
  to ensure only authorized access. The deployment process, driven by
  Infrastructure as Code with OpenTofu and Zarf, enforces immutability in
  authenticator configurations so that any changes must go through a controlled,
  audited process. 

  UDS effectively safeguards authenticator content against unauthorized
  disclosure through multiple integrated security measures. Authenticators, such
  as passwords, cryptographic keys, and tokens, are securely managed by
  Keycloak, which stores sensitive authentication credentials using strong,
  cryptographic hashing algorithms (PBKDF2) and encryption methods, ensuring
  authenticator content remains confidential. Additionally, Keycloak enforces
  secure transmission via Transport Layer Security (TLS) and mutual TLS (mTLS)
  through the Istio Service Mesh, further protecting authenticators during
  authentication sessions.
