  Description:

  Accept and electronically verify Personal Identity Verification-compliant
  credentials.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Acceptance of Personal Identity Verification (PIV)-compliant credentials
  applies to organizations implementing logical access control and physical
  access control systems. PIV-compliant credentials are those credentials issued
  by federal agencies that conform to FIPS Publication 201 and supporting
  guidance documents. The adequacy and reliability of PIV card issuers are
  authorized using SP 800-79-2. Acceptance of PIV-compliant credentials includes
  derived PIV credentials, the use of which is addressed in SP 800-166. The DOD
  Common Access Card (CAC) is an example of a PIV credential. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; system
  security plan; procedures addressing user identification and authentication;

  UDS fully supports authentication using Personal Identity Verification
  (PIV)-compliant credentials through its integrated Identity and Access
  Management solution, Keycloak. Keycloak is technically configured to integrate
  directly with Department of Defense (DoD)-approved Public Key Infrastructure
  (PKI), allowing validation and authentication via X.509 digital certificates
  stored on PIV or Common Access Cards (CAC). When authenticating, Keycloak
  validates the user's presented PIV/CAC certificates against trusted
  DoD-approved certificate authorities, ensuring cryptographic verification of
  identity.

  In UDS, Personal Identity Verification (PIV)-compliant credentials are
  electronically verified using a combination of certificate-based
  authentication mechanisms within Keycloak and mutual TLS within the Istio
  service mesh. When a user presents their CAC/PIV card at login, Keycloak reads
  and validates the embedded x.509 certificateâ€”checking its signature against
  trusted DoD Certificate Authorities, ensuring the certificate is within its
  validity period, and verifying its revocation status.
