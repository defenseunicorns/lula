control-acronym: "[r5] IA-02(08)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Implement replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for access to [Selection
  (one or more): privileged accounts; non-privileged accounts].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to achieve
  successful authentications by replaying previous authentication messages.
  Replay-resistant techniques include protocols that use nonces or challenges
  such as time synchronous or cryptographic authenticators. Related Control(s):
  None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; system
  security plan; procedures addressing user identification and authentication;
  system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system audit records; list of privileged system accounts; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system operations
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing identification
  and authentication capabilities; Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  replay-resistant authentication mechanisms].

  UDS implements replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for network access
  to privileged accounts through its centralized identity management solution,
  Keycloak. Authentication to privileged accounts leverages cryptographically
  signed JSON Web Tokens (JWT) that include unique, timestamped session
  information, making replay attacks infeasible. Additionally, authentication
  sessions are secured via Transport Layer Security (TLS) with mutual TLS (mTLS)
  provided by the Istio Service Mesh, ensuring strong encryption and session
  integrity. The combination of secure token issuance, validation processes, and
  encrypted communication effectively prevents replay attacks, fully meeting the
  intent of this control requirement.
