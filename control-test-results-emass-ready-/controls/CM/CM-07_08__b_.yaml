control-acronym: "[r5] CM-07(08)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Prohibit the use of binary or machine-executable code from sources with
  limited or no warranty or without the provision of source code; and

  (b) Allow exceptions only for compelling mission or operational requirements
  and with the approval of the authorizing official.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Binary or machine executable code applies to all sources of binary or
  machine-executable code, including commercial software and firmware and
  open-source software. Organizations assess software products without
  accompanying source code or from sources with limited or no warranty for
  potential security impacts. The assessments address the fact that software
  products without the provision of source code may be difficult to review,
  repair, or extend. In addition, there may be no owners to make such repairs on
  behalf of organizations. If open-source software is used, the assessments
  address the fact that there is no warranty, the open-source software could
  contain back doors or malware, and there may be no support available. Related
  Control(s): SA-5, SA-22.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  least functionality in the system; configuration management plan; system
  security plan; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; list or record of binary or machine-executable code;
  system component inventory; common secure configuration checklists; system
  audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  determining mission and operational requirements; authorizing official for the
  system; organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  organizational personnel with software management responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational process for approving execution of binary
  or machine-executable code; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the
  prohibition of binary or machine-executable code].

  Determine if:

  sources with limited or no warranty or without the provision of source code
  are allowed only for compelling mission or operational requirements.

  - exceptions to the prohibition of binary or machine-executable code from

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: SI-7(14).2; as
  well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-003956. The resulting
  compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following Rev. 4
  assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance statement:
  SI-7(14).2. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  of the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that
  has not been previously assessed: CCI-003956.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS inherently emphasizes open-source
  software, transparency, and traceability through Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
  and containerization strategies. It provides full visibility and access to
  source code and software components used within the system. The policy
  decision to provide exceptions for utilizing binary or executable code without
  accompanying source code and warranties is an organizational governance
  matter, managed through internal security policies, risk acceptance, and
  approval processes. As this control relates specifically to procedural policy
  decisions about software sourcing rather than technical implementation, it is
  considered outside the technical scope of UDS itself and therefore not
  applicable directly to the technology stack provided.)
