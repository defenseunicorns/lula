control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Establish and document configuration settings for components employed
  within the system that reflect the most restrictive mode consistent with
  operational requirements using [Assignment: organization-defined common secure
  configurations];

  b. Implement the configuration settings;

  c. Identify, document, and approve any deviations from established
  configuration settings for [Assignment: organization-defined system
  components] based on [Assignment: organization-defined operational
  requirements]; and

  d. Monitor and control changes to the configuration settings in accordance
  with organizational policies and procedures.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Configuration settings are the parameters that can be changed in the hardware,
  software, or firmware components of the system that affect the security and
  privacy posture or functionality of the system. Information technology
  products for which configuration settings can be defined include mainframe
  computers, servers, workstations, operating systems, mobile devices,
  input/output devices, protocols, and applications. Parameters that impact the
  security posture of systems include registry settings; account, file, or
  directory permission settings; and settings for functions, protocols, ports,
  services, and remote connections. Privacy parameters are parameters impacting
  the privacy posture of systems, including the parameters required to satisfy
  other privacy controls. Privacy parameters include settings for access
  controls, data processing preferences, and processing and retention
  permissions. Organizations establish organization-wide configuration settings
  and subsequently derive specific configuration settings for systems. The
  established settings become part of the configuration baseline for the system.


  Common secure configurations (also known as security configuration checklists,
  lockdown and hardening guides, and security reference guides) provide
  recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure
  configuration settings for information technology products and platforms as
  well as instructions for configuring those products or platforms to meet
  operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a
  variety of organizations, including information technology product developers,
  manufacturers, vendors, federal agencies, consortia, academia, industry, and
  other organizations in the public and private sectors.


  Implementation of a common secure configuration may be mandated at the
  organization level, mission and business process level, system level, or at a
  higher level, including by a regulatory agency. Common secure configurations
  include the United States Government Configuration Baseline USGCB and security
  technical implementation guides (STIGs), which affect the implementation of
  CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The Security Content
  Automation Protocol (SCAP) and the defined standards within the protocol
  provide an effective method to uniquely identify, track, and control
  configuration settings. Related Control(s): AC-3, AC-19, AU-2, AU-6, CA-9,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  configuration settings for the system; configuration management plan; system
  design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; common secure configuration checklists; system component
  inventory; evidence supporting approved deviations from established
  configuration settings; change control records; system data processing and
  retention permissions; system audit records; system security plan; privacy
  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with privacy
  configuration management responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security and privacy responsibilities; system/network
  administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing configuration
  settings; mechanisms that implement, monitor, and/or control system
  configuration settings; mechanisms that identify and/or document deviations
  from established configuration settings].

  UDS leverages Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices via OpenTofu and secure
  software packaging with Zarf to inherently enforce consistent, documented
  security configuration baselines across deployments. UDS provides baseline
  security configurations managed through version-controlled IaC scripts,
  Kubernetes manifests, and container configurations, which collectively
  establish foundational security checklists. Defense Unicorns also provides
  baseline security configuration checklists aligned with applicable DISA
  Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) or other test batteries
  identified in the Security Assessment Plan (SAP) where applicable to UDS.

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.
rev-4-migration-notes: "Automatically generated test result during Revision 5
  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: CM-6.1, CM-6.2, CM-6.3, CM-6.4; as well as the following Rev. 5
  security requirements: CCI-003941, CCI-003942. The resulting compliance status
