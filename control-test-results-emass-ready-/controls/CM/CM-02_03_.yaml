control-information: >-
  Description:

  Retain [Assignment: organization-defined number] of previous versions of
  baseline configurations of the system to support rollback.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Retaining previous versions of baseline configurations to support rollback
  include hardware, software, firmware, configuration files, configuration
  records, and associated documentation. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  the baseline configuration of the system; configuration management plan;
  system architecture and configuration documentation; system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; copies of previous baseline
  configuration versions; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing baseline
  configurations].


  Statement of Weakness:

  None

  UDS fully supports retention of previous baseline configurations for rollback
  purposes through its use of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via OpenTofu, along
  with secure deployment mechanisms utilizing signed Zarf packages. These tools
  inherently maintain complete, version-controlled histories of baseline
  configurations, including previous software versions, container images,
  infrastructure settings, and dependencies, enabling rapid rollback to stable
  or previously approved system states. Additionally, configuration histories
  are securely stored, auditable, and retained to meet the DoD-defined
  requirement, specifically retaining the previously approved baseline
  configurations of information system components for a minimum duration of
  three months. This built-in capability ensures robust rollback support and
  aligns precisely with the DoD retention standards and organizational rollback
  policies.

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.
