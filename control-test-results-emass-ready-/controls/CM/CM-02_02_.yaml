control-acronym: "[r5] CM-02(02)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Maintain the currency, completeness, accuracy, and availability of the
  baseline configuration of the system using [Assignment: organization-defined
  automated mechanisms].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Automated mechanisms that help organizations maintain consistent baseline
  configurations for systems include configuration management tools, hardware,
  software, firmware inventory tools, and network management tools. Automated
  tools can be used at the organization level, mission and business process
  level, or system level on workstations, servers, notebook computers, network
  components, or mobile devices. Tools can be used to track version numbers on
  operating systems, applications, types of software installed, and current
  patch levels. Automation support for accuracy and currency can be satisfied by
  the implementation of CM-8(2) for organizations that combine system component
  inventory and baseline configuration activities. Related Control(s): CM-7,
  IA-3, RA-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  the baseline configuration of the system; configuration management plan;
  system design documentation; system architecture and configuration
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system component inventory; configuration change control records; system
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing baseline
  configurations; automated mechanisms implementing baseline configuration
  maintenance].
