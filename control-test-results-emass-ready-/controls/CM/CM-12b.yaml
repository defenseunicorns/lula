control-acronym: "[r5] CM-12"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Identify and document the location of [Assignment: organization-defined
  information] and the specific system components on which the information is
  processed and stored;

  b. Identify and document the users who have access to the system and system
  components where the information is processed and stored; and

  c. Document changes to the location (i.e., system or system components) where
  the information is processed and stored.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information location addresses the need to understand where information is
  being processed and stored. Information location includes identifying where
  specific information types and information reside in system components and how
  information is being processed so that information flow can be understood and
  adequate protection and policy management provided for such information and
  system components. The security category of the information is also a factor
  in determining the controls necessary to protect the information and the
  system component where the information resides (see FIPS 199). The location of
  the information and system components is also a factor in the architecture and
  design of the system (see SA-4, SA-8, SA-17). Related Control(s): AC-2, AC-3,
  AC-4, AC-6, AC-23, CM-8, PM-5, RA-2, SA-4, SA-8, SA-17, SC-4, SC-16, SC-28,
  SI-4, SI-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  identification and documentation of information location; configuration
  management plan; system design documentation; system architecture
  documentation; PII inventory documentation; data mapping documentation; audit
  records; list of users with system and system component access; change control
  records; system component inventory; system security plan; privacy plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  managing information location and user access to information; organizational
  personnel with responsibilities for operating, using, and/or maintaining the
  system; organizational personnel with information security and privacy
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes governing information location;
  mechanisms enforcing policies and methods for governing information location].

  Determine if:

  - the users who have access to the system and system components where
  [Assignment: organization-defined information] is processed are identified and
  documented.

  - the users who have access to the system and system components where
  [Assignment: organization-defined information] is stored are identified and
  documented.
