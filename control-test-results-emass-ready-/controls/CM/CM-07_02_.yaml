control-acronym: "[r5] CM-07(02)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Prevent program execution in accordance with [Selection (one or more):
  [Assignment: organization-defined policies, rules of behavior, and/or access
  agreements regarding software program usage and restrictions]; rules
  authorizing the terms and conditions of software program usage].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Prevention of program execution addresses organizational policies, rules of
  behavior, and/or access agreements that restrict software usage and the terms
  and conditions imposed by the developer or manufacturer, including software
  licensing and copyrights. Restrictions include prohibiting auto-execute
  features, restricting roles allowed to approve program execution, permitting
  or prohibiting specific software programs, or restricting the number of
  program instances executed at the same time. Related Control(s): CM-8, PL-4,
  PL-9, PM-5, PS-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  least functionality in the system; configuration management plan; system
  design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system component inventory; common secure configuration
  checklists; specifications for preventing software program execution; change
  control records; system audit records; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes preventing program execution on
  the system; organizational processes for software program usage and
  restrictions; mechanisms preventing program execution on the system;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing software program usage and
  restrictions].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: CM-7(2).1,
  CM-7(2).2, CM-7(2).3. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant
  because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test
  result/compliance statement: CM-7(2).1, CM-7(2).2.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The organization must managed an
  approved software list and the restrictions.)

  UDS enforces strict controls to prevent unauthorized or unapproved software
  execution in alignment with organizationally defined software usage policies.
  Specifically, software deployments occur exclusively through signed and
  validated Zarf packages, ensuring only authorized, securely verified container
  images and application components can run within Kubernetes clusters. OpenTofu
  manages infrastructure resources and system configurations in a consistent,
  version-controlled, and declarative manner. By defining and enforcing strict
  configurations, OpenTofu ensures that only approved software and container
  images are provisioned and executed within the Kubernetes clusters.
