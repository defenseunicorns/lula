control-acronym: "[r5] CM-03(06)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Ensure that cryptographic mechanisms used to provide the following controls
  are under configuration management: [Assignment: organization-defined
  controls].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The controls referenced in the control enhancement refer to security and
  privacy controls from the control catalog. Regardless of the cryptographic
  mechanisms employed, processes and procedures are in place to manage those
  mechanisms. For example, if system components use certificates for
  identification and authentication, a process is implemented to address the
  expiration of those certificates. Related Control(s): SC-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  system configuration change control; configuration management plan; system
  design documentation; system architecture and configuration documentation;
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; system security
  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration change
  control responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers; members of
  change control board or similar].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for configuration change control;
  cryptographic mechanisms implementing organizational security safeguards
  (controls)].

  UDS ensures cryptographic mechanisms providing organizational security
  safeguards are strictly controlled under configuration management through
  Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using OpenTofu, and secure deployment practices
  via signed Zarf packages. Cryptographic settings including TLS certificates,
  mutual TLS (mTLS) configurations within Istio Service Mesh, and identity
  provider certificates managed by Keycloak are version-controlled, explicitly
  documented, and securely managed to prevent unauthorized modifications. The
  UDS technology stack utilizes FIPS modules in the underlying container images
  to aid in encryption. These cryptographic mechanisms are under configuration
  management and typically reference a repository that has the image marked as
  FIPS, ensuring that they are effectively managed and documented.
