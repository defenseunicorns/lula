control-information: >-
  Description:

  Analyze changes to the system in a separate test environment before
  implementation in an operational environment, looking for security and privacy
  impacts due to flaws, weaknesses, incompatibility, or intentional malice.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A separate test environment requires an environment that is physically or
  logically separate and distinct from the operational environment. The
  separation is sufficient to ensure that activities in the test environment do
  not impact activities in the operational environment and that information in
  the operational environment is not inadvertently transmitted to the test
  environment. Separate environments can be achieved by physical or logical
  means. If physically separate test environments are not implemented,
  organizations determine the strength of mechanism required when implementing
  logical separation. Related Control(s): SA-11, SC-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  security impact analyses for changes to the system; procedures addressing
  privacy impact analyses for changes to the system; configuration management
  plan; security impact analysis documentation; privacy impact analysis
  documentation; privacy impact assessment; privacy risk assessment
  documentation; analysis tools and associated outputs system design
  documentation; system architecture and configuration documentation; change
  control records; procedures addressing the authority to test with PII; system
  audit records; documentation of separate test and operational environments;
  system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  conducting security and privacy impact analyses; organizational personnel with
  information security and privacy responsibilities; system/network
  administrators; members of change control board or similar].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for security and privacy impact
  analyses; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing security and privacy
  impact analyses of changes].

  - changes to the system are analyzed in a separate test environment before
  implementation in an operational environment.

  - changes to the system are analyzed for security impacts due to flaws.

  - changes to the system are analyzed for privacy impacts due to flaws.

  - changes to the system are analyzed for security impacts due to weaknesses.

  - changes to the system are analyzed for privacy impacts due to weaknesses.

  - changes to the system are analyzed for privacy impacts due to
  incompatibility.

  - changes to the system are analyzed for privacy impacts due to
  incompatibility.

  - changes to the system are analyzed for security impacts due to intentional
  malice.

  - changes to the system are analyzed for privacy impacts due to intentional

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: CM-4(1).1,
  CM-4(1).2; as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-003931.
  The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following
  Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance
  statement: CM-4(1).1. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant
  because of the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment
  procedure that has not been previously assessed: CCI-003931.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The UDS technology stack provides all
  the information needed to analyze changes, but the responsibility for
  conducting the analysis of changes to the information system in a separate
  test environment, looking for security impacts due to flaws, weaknesses,
  incompatibility, or intentional malice, lies with the organization.)

  UDS fully supports organizational analysis of changes within dedicated test
  environments prior to implementation in operational systems. Leveraging
  Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with OpenTofu and secure deployments using signed
  Zarf packages, UDS enables consistent and repeatable configuration testing in
  isolated, controlled environments that mirror production systems.
