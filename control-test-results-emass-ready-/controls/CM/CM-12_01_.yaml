control-acronym: "[r5] CM-12(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Use automated tools to identify [Assignment: organization-defined information
  by information type] on [Assignment: organization-defined system components]
  to ensure controls are in place to protect organizational information and
  individual privacy.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The use of automated tools helps to increase the effectiveness and efficiency
  of the information location capability implemented within the system.
  Automation also helps organizations manage the data produced during
  information location activities and share such information across the
  organization. The output of automated information location tools can be used
  to guide and inform system architecture and design decisions. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  identification and documentation of information location; configuration
  management plan; system design documentation; PII inventory documentation;
  data mapping documentation; change control records; system component
  inventory; system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  managing information location; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes governing information location;
  automated mechanisms enforcing policies and methods for governing information
  location; automated tools used to identify information on system components].
