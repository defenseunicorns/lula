control-information: >-
  Description:

  Maintain the currency, completeness, accuracy, and availability of the
  inventory of system components using [Assignment: organization-defined
  automated mechanisms].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations maintain system inventories to the extent feasible. For example,
  virtual machines can be difficult to monitor because such machines are not
  visible to the network when not in use. In such cases, organizations maintain
  as up-to-date, complete, and accurate an inventory as is deemed reasonable.
  Automated maintenance can be achieved by the implementation of CM-2(2) for
  organizations that combine system component inventory and baseline
  configuration activities. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  system component inventory; configuration management plan; system design
  documentation; system security plan; system component inventory; change
  control records; system maintenance records; system audit records; system
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with component inventory
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for maintaining the system
  component inventory; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the
  system component inventory].

  Determine if:

  - [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms] are used to maintain
  the currency of the system component inventory.

  - [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms] are used to maintain
  the completeness of the system component inventory.

  - [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms] are used to maintain
  the accuracy of the system component inventory.

  - [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms] are used to maintain
  the availability of the system component inventory.

  UDS employs automated mechanisms to maintain an up-to-date and accurate
  inventory of information system components. Specifically, UDS leverages
  Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using OpenTofu and deployment automation with
  secure Zarf packages to maintain precise, documented inventories of all
  deployed infrastructure, containers, and applications.

  UDS employs automated mechanisms to maintain a complete, accurate, and
  continuously updated inventory of information system components. Specifically,
  the use of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with OpenTofu and secure software
  bundling via Zarf packages ensures all infrastructure, services, and
  applications are documented, tracked, and deployed consistently across
  environments. The UDS user interface is automatically updated to maintain a
  complete real-time inventory of software deployed within UDS.

  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: CM-8(2).1, CM-8(2).2, CM-8(2).3, CM-8(2).4; as well as the
  following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-003968. The resulting compliance
