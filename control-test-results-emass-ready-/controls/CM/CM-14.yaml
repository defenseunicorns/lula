control-acronym: "[r5] CM-14"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Prevent the installation of [Assignment: organization-defined software and
  firmware components] without verification that the component has been
  digitally signed using a certificate that is recognized and approved by the
  organization.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Software and firmware components prevented from installation unless signed
  with recognized and approved certificates include software and firmware
  version updates, patches, service packs, device drivers, and basic
  input/output system updates. Organizations can identify applicable software
  and firmware components by type, by specific items, or a combination of both.
  Digital signatures and organizational verification of such signatures is a
  method of code authentication. Related Control(s): CM-7, SC-12, SC-13, SI-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  digitally signed certificates for software and firmware components;
  configuration management plan; system security plan; system design
  documentation; change control records; system component inventory; system
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  verifying digitally signed certificates for software and firmware component
  installation; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes governing information location;
  mechanisms enforcing policies and methods for governing information location;
  automated tools supporting or implementing digitally signatures for software
  and firmware components; automated tools supporting or implementing
  verification of digital signatures for software and firmware component
  installation].

  Determine if:

  - the installation of [Assignment: organization-defined software and firmware
  components] is prevented unless it is verified that the software has been
  digitally signed using a certificate recognized and approved by the
  organization.

  - the installation of [Assignment: organization-defined software and firmware
  components] is prevented unless it is verified that the firmware has been
  digitally signed using a certificate recognized and approved by the
  organization.
