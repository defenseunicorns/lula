control-acronym: "[r5] CM-05"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Define, document, approve, and enforce physical and logical access
  restrictions associated with changes to the system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Changes to the hardware, software, or firmware components of systems or the
  operational procedures related to the system can potentially have significant
  effects on the security of the systems or individualsâ€™ privacy. Therefore,
  organizations permit only qualified and authorized individuals to access
  systems for purposes of initiating changes. Access restrictions include
  physical and logical access controls (see AC-3 and PE-3), software libraries,
  workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (i.e., changes
  implemented into external interfaces rather than directly into systems), and
  change windows (i.e., changes occur only during specified times). Related
  Control(s): AC-3, AC-5, AC-6, CM-9, PE-3, SC-28, SC-34, SC-37, SI-2, SI-10.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  access restrictions for changes to the system; configuration management plan;
  system design documentation; system architecture and configuration
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  logical access approvals; physical access approvals; access credentials;
  change control records; system audit records; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with logical access control
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with physical access control
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing access restrictions
  to change; mechanisms supporting, implementing, or enforcing access
  restrictions associated with changes to the system].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: CM-5.1, CM-5.2,
  CM-5.3, CM-5.4, CM-5.5, CM-5.6, CM-5.7, CM-5.8; as well as the following Rev.
  5 security requirements: CCI-003935, CCI-003936. The resulting compliance
  status was set to non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment
  procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance statement: CM-5.1,
  CM-5.2, CM-5.3, CM-5.4, CM-5.5, CM-5.6, CM-5.7. The resulting compliance
  status was set to non-compliant because of the addition of a new security
  requirement to the assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed:
  CCI-003935, CCI-003936.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The UDS technology stack provides the
  IDAM solution Keycloak to assist in controlling logical access, but the
  responsibility for defining, documenting, approving, and enforcing physical
  access restrictions associated with changes to the information system lies
  with the organization.)

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS platform provides strong
  technical capabilities to define and enforce logical access restrictions
  associated with information system changes. Using centralized identity
  management through Keycloak and Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC),
  UDS enables granular control of who can propose, approve, and implement system
  changes. Additionally, infrastructure management through OpenTofu and secure
  deployments via signed Zarf packages ensures that changes are
  version-controlled and auditable. However, explicitly defining and formally
  documenting logical access restrictions such as identifying specific roles or
  individuals authorized to perform particular types of system changes remains
  an organizational responsibility.

  UDS effectively enforces logical access restrictions associated with
  information system changes through integrated identity and access management
  solutions. Centralized authentication and authorization managed by Keycloak,
  combined with Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), ensures that only
  explicitly authorized individuals or roles can implement system modifications.
  Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via OpenTofu and secure software deployments
  using signed Zarf packages enforce these access controls systematically,
  providing automated validation and auditing of permissions during the
  deployment process. Additionally, the policy engine Pepr proactively blocks
  unauthorized configuration changes. Collectively, these integrated mechanisms
  enforce strong logical access restrictions, fully satisfying this control.
