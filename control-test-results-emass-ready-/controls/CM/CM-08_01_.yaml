  Description:

  Update the inventory of system components as part of component installations,
  removals, and system updates.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations can improve the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of
  system component inventories if the inventories are updated as part of
  component installations or removals or during general system updates. If
  inventories are not updated at these key times, there is a greater likelihood
  that the information will not be appropriately captured and documented. System
  updates include hardware, software, and firmware components. Related
  Control(s): PM-16.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  system component inventory; configuration management plan; system security
  plan; system component inventory; inventory reviews and update records; change
  control records; component installation records; component removal records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with component inventory
  updating responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for updating the system component
  inventory; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing system component
  inventory updates].
