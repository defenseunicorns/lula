control-acronym: "[r5] CM-03(07)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Review changes to the system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] or
  when [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances] to determine whether
  unauthorized changes have occurred.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Indications that warrant a review of changes to the system and the specific
  circumstances justifying such reviews may be obtained from activities carried
  out by organizations during the configuration change process or continuous
  monitoring process. Related Control(s): AU-6, AU-7, CM-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  system configuration change control; configuration management plan; change
  control records; system architecture and configuration documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit records;
  system component inventory; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration change
  control responsibilities; organizational personnel with security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; members of change control
  board or similar].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for configuration change control;
  mechanisms implementing audit records for changes].

cci-definition: "003925: Review changes to the system on an organization-defined
  frequency or when there are organization-defined circumstances to determine
  whether unauthorized changes have occurred.; 003926: Defines the frequency for
  reviewing changes to the system.; 003927: Defines the circumstances for
  determining whether unauthorized changes to the system have occurred."
implementation-guidance: CCI-003926 and CCI-003927 of this assessment procedure
  are automatically compliant because of coverage by DoD Enterprise.
assessment-procedures: "Determine if changes to the system are reviewed
  [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] or when [Assignment:
  organization-defined circumstances] to determine whether unauthorized changes
  have occurred."

test-results: >-
  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: CM-5(2).1,
  CM-5(2).2, CM-5(2).3, CM-5(2).4; as well as the following Rev. 5 security
  requirements: CCI-003925, CCI-003926, CCI-003927. The resulting compliance
  status was set to non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment
  procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance statement: CM-5(2).2,
  CM-5(2).3. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because of
  the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that
  has not been previously assessed: CCI-003925, CCI-003926, CCI-003927.


  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The UDS technology stack provides the
  necessary tools to support the analysis of system changes but does not perform
  the review of unauthorized changes itself.)
