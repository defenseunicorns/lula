control-acronym: "[r5] CM-07(05)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Identify [Assignment: organization-defined software programs authorized to
  execute on the system];

  (b) Employ a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of
  authorized software programs on the system; and

  (c) Review and update the list of authorized software programs [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Authorized software programs can be limited to specific versions or from a
  specific source. To facilitate a comprehensive authorized software process and
  increase the strength of protection for attacks that bypass application level
  authorized software, software programs may be decomposed into and monitored at
  different levels of detail. These levels include applications, application
  programming interfaces, application modules, scripts, system processes, system
  services, kernel functions, registries, drivers, and dynamic link libraries.
  The concept of permitting the execution of authorized software may also be
  applied to user actions, system ports and protocols, IP addresses/ranges,
  websites, and MAC addresses. Organizations consider verifying the integrity of
  authorized software programs using digital signatures, cryptographic
  checksums, or hash functions. Verification of authorized software can occur
  either prior to execution or at system startup. The identification of
  authorized URLs for websites is addressed in CA-3(5) and SC-7. Related

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  least functionality in the system; configuration management plan; system
  design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; list of software programs authorized to execute on the system;
  system component inventory; common secure configuration checklists; review and
  update records associated with list of authorized software programs; change
  control records; system audit records; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  identifying software authorized to execute on the system; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system/network
  administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational process for identifying, reviewing, and
  updating programs authorized to execute on the system; organizational process
  for implementing authorized software policy; mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing authorized software policy].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: CM-7(5).1,
  CM-7(5).2. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test
  result/compliance statement: CM-7(5).2.


  UDS supports defining and enforcing authorized software execution through the
  use of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via OpenTofu and secure deployment with
  Zarf packages, which explicitly establish the set of approved software
  components allowed to run within Kubernetes clusters.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (This is tracked outside UDS and is
  typically done in the eMASS software tab.)
