control-information: >-
  Description:

  Ensure compliance with [Assignment: organization-defined registration
  requirements for functions, ports, protocols, and services].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations use the registration process to manage, track, and provide
  oversight for systems and implemented functions, ports, protocols, and
  services. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System security plan; configuration management policy;
  procedures addressing least functionality in the system; configuration
  management plan; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system component inventory; audit and compliance reviews; system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes ensuring compliance with
  registration requirements for functions, ports, protocols, and/or services;
  mechanisms implementing compliance with registration requirements for
  functions, ports, protocols, and/or services].

  providing system or Common Control Package.

  UDS ensures compliance with organizationally defined registration requirements
  for functions, ports, protocols, and services through its integrated
  infrastructure management and policy enforcement capabilities. Specifically,
  the platform leverages Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices via OpenTofu to
  explicitly define and provision approved network configurations. The Istio
  Service Mesh enforces these definitions, strictly controlling and monitoring
  network communications, ports, protocols, and inter-service interactions.
  Istio explicitly controls and provides observability into network
  communications, clearly defining allowable protocols, ports, and services.
  Istio's telemetry data (accessible via Prometheus and Grafana) allows
  administrators to monitor network traffic and enforce policy compliance.
  Together, these tools offer detailed metrics and visualizations of the PPS
  usage across Kubernetes clusters. Grafana dashboards visualize active network
  services, resource endpoints, traffic patterns, and anomalies. By aggregating
  container and system logs, Vector and Loki provide audit trails and detailed
  records of PPS usage, facilitating compliance monitoring and forensic
  analysis.
