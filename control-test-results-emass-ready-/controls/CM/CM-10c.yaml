control-acronym: "[r5] CM-10"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Use software and associated documentation in accordance with contract
  agreements and copyright laws;

  b. Track the use of software and associated documentation protected by
  quantity licenses to control copying and distribution; and

  c. Control and document the use of peer-to-peer file sharing technology to
  ensure that this capability is not used for the unauthorized distribution,
  display, performance, or reproduction of copyrighted work.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Software license tracking can be accomplished by manual or automated methods,
  depending on organizational needs. Examples of contract agreements include
  software license agreements and non-disclosure agreements. Related Control(s):
  AC-17, AU-6, CM-7, CM-8, PM-30, SC-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; software usage
  restrictions; software contract agreements and copyright laws; site license
  documentation; list of software usage restrictions; software license tracking
  reports; configuration management plan; system security plan; system security
  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel operating, using, and/or
  maintaining the system; organizational personnel with software license
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for tracking the use of software
  protected by quantity licenses; organizational processes for
  controlling/documenting the use of peer-to-peer file sharing technology;
  mechanisms implementing software license tracking; mechanisms implementing and
  controlling the use of peer-to-peer files sharing technology].

assessment-procedures: Determine if the use of peer-to-peer file sharing
  technology is controlled and documented to ensure that peer-to-peer file
  sharing is not used for the unauthorized distribution, display, performance,
  or reproduction of copyrighted work.
