control-acronym: "[r5] CM-04(02)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  After system changes, verify that the impacted controls are implemented
  correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with
  regard to meeting the security and privacy requirements for the system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Implementation in this context refers to installing changed code in the
  operational system that may have an impact on security or privacy controls.
  Related Control(s): SA-11, SC-3, SI-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  security impact analyses for changes to the system; procedures addressing
  privacy impact analyses for changes to the system; privacy risk assessment
  documentation; configuration management plan; security and privacy impact
  analysis documentation; privacy impact assessment; analysis tools and
  associated outputs; change control records; control assessment results; system
  audit records; system component inventory; system security plan; privacy plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  conducting security and privacy impact analyses; organizational personnel with
  information security and privacy responsibilities; system/network
  administrators; security and privacy assessors].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for security and privacy impact
  analyses; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing security and privacy
  impact analyses of changes].

  Determine if:

  - the impacted controls are implemented correctly with regard to meeting the
  security requirements for the system after system changes.

  - the impacted controls are implemented correctly with regard to meeting the
  privacy requirements for the system after system changes.

  - the impacted controls are operating as intended with regard to meeting the
  security requirements for the system after system changes.

  - the impacted controls are operating as intended with regard to meeting the
  privacy requirements for the system after system changes.

  - the impacted controls are producing the desired outcome with regard to
  meeting the security requirements for the system after system changes.

  - the impacted controls are producing the desired outcome with regard to
  meeting the privacy requirements for the system after system changes.
