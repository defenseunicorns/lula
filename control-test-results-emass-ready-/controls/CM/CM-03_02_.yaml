control-acronym: "[r5] CM-03(02)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Test, validate, and document changes to the system before finalizing the
  implementation of the changes.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Changes to systems include modifications to hardware, software, or firmware
  components and configuration settings defined in CM-6. Organizations ensure
  that testing does not interfere with system operations that support
  organizational mission and business functions. Individuals or groups
  conducting tests understand security and privacy policies and procedures,
  system security and privacy policies and procedures, and the health, safety,
  and environmental risks associated with specific facilities or processes.
  Operational systems may need to be taken offline, or replicated to the extent
  feasible, before testing can be conducted. If systems must be taken offline
  for testing, the tests are scheduled to occur during planned system outages
  whenever possible. If the testing cannot be conducted on operational systems,
  organizations employ compensating controls. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; configuration
  management plan; procedures addressing system configuration change control;
  system design documentation; system architecture and configuration
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  test records; validation records; change control records; system audit
  records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration change
  control responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers; members of
  change control board or similar].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for configuration change control;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing, testing, validating, and
  documenting system changes].

  Determine if:

  - changes to the system are tested before finalizing the implementation of the
  changes.

  - changes to the system are validated before finalizing the implementation of
  the changes.

  - changes to the system are documented before finalizing the implementation of
  the changes.

  UDS ensures thorough testing of all information system changes prior to
  deployment into operational environments. Leveraging Infrastructure as Code
  (IaC) with OpenTofu, alongside secure software delivery through signed Zarf
  packages, UDS provides standardized, repeatable, and isolated environments
  (such as dedicated staging or testing environments) where system and software
  configuration changes are rigorously tested before production deployment.

  UDS fully supports validation of information system changes prior to
  operational deployment. Leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) through
  OpenTofu and secure software deployments via signed Zarf packages, UDS ensures
  that all proposed system changes are consistently documented, validated, and
  version-controlled in dedicated pre-production environments. Automated
  security compliance checks and validations provided by Pepr ensure that
  proposed changes align with established organizational baselines and security
  policies before reaching the operational environment. Additionally, detailed
  audit trails provided by Vector and Loki record all validation activities,
  facilitating review and compliance audits. Collectively, these capabilities
  fully satisfy the requirement to validate all system changes prior to
  implementation in the operational environment.

  UDS fully meets the requirement to document changes to the information system
  before they are implemented in operational environments. Infrastructure as
  Code (IaC) practices using OpenTofu, combined with secure deployment
  mechanisms via signed Zarf packages, inherently provide clear and
  comprehensive documentation of every proposed system change. All changes,
  including software updates, infrastructure modifications, and security policy
  adjustments, are systematically documented, version-controlled, and auditable.
  Audit trails generated by Vector and stored securely in Loki further ensure
  traceability and accountability of these documented changes. Collectively,
  these capabilities ensure complete and verifiable documentation of system
  changes prior to operational deployment, fully satisfying the intent of this
  control.
