control-acronym: "[r5] CM-04"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Analyze changes to the system to determine potential security and privacy
  impacts prior to change implementation.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizational personnel with security or privacy responsibilities conduct
  impact analyses. Individuals conducting impact analyses possess the necessary
  skills and technical expertise to analyze the changes to systems as well as
  the security or privacy ramifications. Impact analyses include reviewing
  security and privacy plans, policies, and procedures to understand control
  requirements; reviewing system design documentation and operational procedures
  to understand control implementation and how specific system changes might
  affect the controls; reviewing the impact of changes on organizational supply
  chain partners with stakeholders; and determining how potential changes to a
  system create new risks to the privacy of individuals and the ability of
  implemented controls to mitigate those risks. Impact analyses also include
  risk assessments to understand the impact of the changes and determine if
  additional controls are required. Related Control(s): CA-7, CM-3, CM-8, CM-9,
  MA-2, RA-3, RA-5, RA-8, SA-5, SA-8, SA-10, SI-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  security impact analyses for changes to the system; procedures addressing
  privacy impact analyses for changes to the system; configuration management
  plan; security impact analysis documentation; privacy impact analysis
  documentation; privacy impact assessment; privacy risk assessment
  documentation, system design documentation; analysis tools and associated
  outputs; change control records; system audit records; system security plan;
  privacy plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  conducting security impact analyses; organizational personnel with
  responsibility for conducting privacy impact analyses; organizational
  personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities; system
  developer; system/network administrators; members of change control board or
  similar].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for security impact analyses;
  organizational processes for privacy impact analyses].

  Determine if:

  - changes to the system are analyzed to determine potential security impacts
  prior to change implementation.

  - changes to the system are analyzed to determine potential privacy impacts
  prior to change implementation.

test-results: UDS provides technical capabilities to support the analysis of
  potential security impacts of changes to the information system prior to
  implementation. Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with OpenTofu and secure,
  version-controlled deployments via signed Zarf packages, UDS allows
  comprehensive visibility into proposed changes, facilitating detailed security
  impact analyses. Zarf provides detailed SBOMs and Defense Unicorns provides
  CVE scans through grype.

  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: CM-4.1; as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements:
  CCI-003930. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  of the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that
  has not been previously assessed: CCI-003930."
