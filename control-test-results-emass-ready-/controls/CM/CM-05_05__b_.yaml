control-acronym: "[r5] CM-05(05)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Limit privileges to change system components and system-related
  information within a production or operational environment; and

  (b) Review and reevaluate privileges [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  In many organizations, systems support multiple mission and business
  functions. Limiting privileges to change system components with respect to
  operational systems is necessary because changes to a system component may
  have far-reaching effects on mission and business processes supported by the
  system. The relationships between systems and mission/business processes are,
  in some cases, unknown to developers. System-related information includes
  operational procedures. Related Control(s): AC-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  access restrictions for changes to the system; configuration management plan;
  system design documentation; system architecture and configuration
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  user privilege reviews; user privilege recertifications; system component
  inventory; change control records; system audit records; system security plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing access restrictions
  to change; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing access restrictions for
  change].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: CM-5(5).3,
  CM-5(5).4, CM-5(5).5, CM-5(5).6; as well as the following Rev. 5 security
  requirements: CCI-003939, CCI-003940. The resulting compliance status was set
  to non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no
  locally entered test result/compliance statement: CM-5(5).5, CM-5(5).6. The
  resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because of the addition
  of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that has not been
  previously assessed: CCI-003939, CCI-003940.


  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Though UDS provides the audit trail
  the organization must assign personnel to complete a review of the data every
  90 days.)
