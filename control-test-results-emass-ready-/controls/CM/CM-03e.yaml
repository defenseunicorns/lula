control-acronym: "[r5] CM-03"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Determine and document the types of changes to the system that are
  configuration-controlled;

  b. Review proposed configuration-controlled changes to the system and approve
  or disapprove such changes with explicit consideration for security and
  privacy impact analyses;

  c. Document configuration change decisions associated with the system;

  d. Implement approved configuration-controlled changes to the system;

  e. Retain records of configuration-controlled changes to the system for
  [Assignment: organization-defined time period];

  f. Monitor and review activities associated with configuration-controlled
  changes to the system; and

  g. Coordinate and provide oversight for configuration change control
  activities through [Assignment: organization-defined configuration change
  control element] that convenes [Selection (one or more): [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency]; when [Assignment: organization-defined
  configuration change conditions]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Configuration change control for organizational systems involves the
  systematic proposal, justification, implementation, testing, review, and
  disposition of system changes, including system upgrades and modifications.
  Configuration change control includes changes to baseline configurations,
  configuration items of systems, operational procedures, configuration settings
  for system components, remediate vulnerabilities, and unscheduled or
  unauthorized changes. Processes for managing configuration changes to systems
  include Configuration Control Boards or Change Advisory Boards that review and
  approve proposed changes. For changes that impact privacy risk, the senior
  agency official for privacy updates privacy impact assessments and system of
  records notices. For new systems or major upgrades, organizations consider
  including representatives from the development organizations on the
  Configuration Control Boards or Change Advisory Boards. Auditing of changes
  includes activities before and after changes are made to systems and the
  auditing activities required to implement such changes. See also SA-10.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  system configuration change control; configuration management plan; system
  architecture and configuration documentation; change control records; system
  audit records; change control audit and review reports;
  agenda/minutes/documentation from configuration change control oversight
  meetings; system security plan; privacy plan; privacy impact assessments;
  system of records notices; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration change
  control responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators; members of change
  control board or similar].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for configuration change control;
  mechanisms that implement configuration change control].
