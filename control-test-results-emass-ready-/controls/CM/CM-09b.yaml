control-acronym: "[r5] CM-09"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Develop, document, and implement a configuration management plan for the
  system that:

  a. Addresses roles, responsibilities, and configuration management processes
  and procedures;

  b. Establishes a process for identifying configuration items throughout the
  system development life cycle and for managing the configuration of the
  configuration items;

  c. Defines the configuration items for the system and places the configuration
  items under configuration management;

  d. Is reviewed and approved by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
  roles]; and

  e. Protects the configuration management plan from unauthorized disclosure and
  modification.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Configuration management activities occur throughout the system development
  life cycle. As such, there are developmental configuration management
  activities (e.g., the control of code and software libraries) and operational
  configuration management activities (e.g., control of installed components and
  how the components are configured). Configuration management plans satisfy the
  requirements in configuration management policies while being tailored to
  individual systems. Configuration management plans define processes and
  procedures for how configuration management is used to support system
  development life cycle activities.


  Configuration management plans are generated during the development and
  acquisition stage of the system development life cycle. The plans describe how
  to advance changes through change management processes; update configuration
  settings and baselines; maintain component inventories; control development,
  test, and operational environments; and develop, release, and update key
  documents.


  Organizations can employ templates to help ensure the consistent and timely
  development and implementation of configuration management plans. Templates
  can represent a configuration management plan for the organization with
  subsets of the plan implemented on a system by system basis. Configuration
  management approval processes include the designation of key stakeholders
  responsible for reviewing and approving proposed changes to systems, and
  personnel who conduct security and privacy impact analyses prior to the
  implementation of changes to the systems. Configuration items are the system
  components, such as the hardware, software, firmware, and documentation to be
  configuration-managed. As systems continue through the system development life
  cycle, new configuration items may be identified, and some existing
  configuration items may no longer need to be under configuration control.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  configuration management planning; configuration management plan; system
  design documentation; system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  developing the configuration management plan; organizational personnel with
  responsibilities for implementing and managing processes defined in the
  configuration management plan; organizational personnel with responsibilities
  for protecting the configuration management plan; organizational personnel
  with information security and privacy responsibilities; system/network
  administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for developing and documenting
  the configuration management plan; organizational processes for identifying
  and managing configuration items; organizational processes for protecting the
  configuration management plan; mechanisms implementing the configuration
  management plan; mechanisms for managing configuration items; mechanisms for
  protecting the configuration management plan].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: CM-9.3, CM-9.4,
  CM-9.5, CM-9.6; as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements:
  CCI-003973, CCI-003974. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally
  entered test result/compliance statement: CM-9.3, CM-9.4, CM-9.5, CM-9.6. The
  resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because of the addition
  of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that has not been
  previously assessed: CCI-003973, CCI-003974.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The organization must define and
  manage the configuration management plan outside of UDS.)
