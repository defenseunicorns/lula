control-acronym: "[r5] CM-01"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop, document, and disseminate to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles]:

  1. [Selection (one or more): Organization-level; Mission/business
  process-level; System-level] configuration management policy that:
    (a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
    (b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and
  2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the configuration management
  policy and the associated configuration management controls;

  b. Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the
  development, documentation, and dissemination of the configuration management
  policy and procedures; and

  c. Review and update the current configuration management:

  1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events]; and

  2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Configuration management policy and procedures address the controls in the CM
  family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk
  management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and
  procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy
  assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs
  collaborate on the development of configuration management policy and
  procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the
  organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for
  mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be
  included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented
  by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations.
  Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for
  mission/business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe
  how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the
  individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be
  documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
  documents. Events that may precipitate an update to configuration management
  policy and procedures include, but are not limited to, assessment or audit
  findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws,
  executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and
  guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational
  policy or procedure. Related Control(s): PM-9, PS-8, SA-8, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy and procedures;
  security and privacy program policies and procedures; assessment or audit
  findings; documentation of security incidents or breaches; system security
  plan; privacy plan; risk management strategy; other relevant artifacts,
  documents, or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities].

  - configuration management procedures to facilitate the implementation of the

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: CM-1.2, CM-1.5,
  CM-1.6, CM-1.9. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant
  because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test
  result/compliance statement: CM-1.5, CM-1.6, CM-1.9.


  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The UDS technology stack does not
  create or document configuration management policies, as this is a
  policy-driven activity. The responsibility for developing, documenting, and
  disseminating a configuration management policy, as well as associated
  procedures, lies with the organization. However, UDS provides tools to assist
  in conducting configuration management. This includes the UDS CLI and
  utilizing Zarf as delivery methods for the UDS technology stack itself. These
  tools support the implementation of configuration management practices by
  enabling efficient deployment and management of the UDS components. While the
  UDS platform provides these technical capabilities, the strategic planning,
  execution, and documentation of configuration management policies and
  procedures are managed by Mission Hero, ensuring alignment with organizational
  requirements and security policies.)

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS provides robust technical
  capabilities supporting the organization's implementation of configuration
  management controls and procedures. Specifically, UDS utilizes Infrastructure
  as Code (IaC) via OpenTofu and secure software distribution using signed Zarf
  packages, facilitating consistent and documented configuration management
  aligned with organizational policies. The policy enforcement capabilities
  provided by Pepr, further support procedural compliance and rapid detection of
  configuration deviations. However, explicitly defining, reviewing,
  documenting, and updating procedures at regular intervals (e.g., annually or
  quarterly) to facilitate implementation of configuration management policies
  remains an organizational responsibility. )
