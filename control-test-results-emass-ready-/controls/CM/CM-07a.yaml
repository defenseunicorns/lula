control-acronym: "[r5] CM-07"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Configure the system to provide only [Assignment: organization-defined
  mission essential capabilities]; and

  b. Prohibit or restrict the use of the following functions, ports, protocols,
  software, and/or services: [Assignment: organization-defined prohibited or
  restricted functions, system ports, protocols, software, and/or services].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Systems provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the
  functions and services routinely provided by default may not be necessary to
  support essential organizational missions, functions, or operations.
  Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a
  single system component, but doing so increases risk over limiting the
  services provided by that single component. Where feasible, organizations
  limit component functionality to a single function per component.
  Organizations consider removing unused or unnecessary software and disabling
  unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent
  unauthorized connection of components, transfer of information, and tunneling.
  Organizations employ network scanning tools, intrusion detection and
  prevention systems, and end-point protection technologies, such as firewalls
  and host-based intrusion detection systems, to identify and prevent the use of
  prohibited functions, protocols, ports, and services. Least functionality can
  also be achieved as part of the fundamental design and development of the
  system (see SA-8, SC-2, and SC-3). Related Control(s): AC-3, AC-4, CM-2, CM-5,
  CM-6, CM-11, RA-5, SA-4, SA-5, SA-8, SA-9, SA-15, SC-2, SC-3, SC-7, SC-37,
  SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  least functionality in the system; configuration management plan; system
  design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system component inventory; common secure configuration
  checklists; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes prohibiting or restricting
  functions, ports, protocols, software, and/or services; mechanisms
  implementing restrictions or prohibition of functions, ports, protocols,
  software, and/or services].

test-results: "UDS is designed with least functionality in mind only necessary
  services and software are installed. Each component of UDS (Istio, Keycloak,
  etc.) serves a purpose and thereâ€™s nothing extraneous running in the
  environment. Zarf packaging helps here: it packages only the required
  applications and their dependencies, so you're not including miscellaneous
  tools or bloat."
