control-acronym: "[r5] CM-07(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Review the system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to identify
  unnecessary and/or nonsecure functions, ports, protocols, software, and
  services; and

  (b) Disable or remove [Assignment: organization-defined functions, ports,
  protocols, software, and services within the system deemed to be unnecessary
  and/or nonsecure].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations review functions, ports, protocols, and services provided by
  systems or system components to determine the functions and services that are
  candidates for elimination. Such reviews are especially important during
  transition periods from older technologies to newer technologies (e.g.,
  transition from IPv4 to IPv6). These technology transitions may require
  implementing the older and newer technologies simultaneously during the
  transition period and returning to minimum essential functions, ports,
  protocols, and services at the earliest opportunity. Organizations can either
  decide the relative security of the function, port, protocol, and/or service
  or base the security decision on the assessment of other entities. Unsecure
  protocols include Bluetooth, FTP, and peer-to-peer networking. Related
  Control(s): AC-18.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  least functionality in the system; configuration management plan; system
  design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; common secure configuration checklists; documented reviews of
  functions, ports, protocols, and/or services; change control records; system
  audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  reviewing functions, ports, protocols, and services on the system;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for reviewing or disabling
  functions, ports, protocols, and services on the system; mechanisms
  implementing review and disabling of functions, ports, protocols, and/or
  services].

test-results: UDS leverages Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via OpenTofu and secure
  deployments using Zarf packages, enabling centralized control and definition
  of allowable services, ports, protocols, and network access within Kubernetes
  clusters. The Istio Service Mesh further enforces these definitions by
  explicitly allowing only approved communications between microservices,
  automatically blocking undefined or unauthorized protocols, ports, and network
  pathways. Although UDS inherently supports enforcing strict control of
  services, ports, and network configurations, explicitly defining acceptable
  and unacceptable components including ports, services, and protocols is an
  organizational policy decision to configure.
