  Description:

  Limit privileges to change software resident within software libraries.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Software libraries include privileged programs. Related Control(s): AC-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  access restrictions for changes to the system; configuration management plan;
  system design documentation; system architecture and configuration
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system component inventory; change control records; system audit records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing access restrictions
  to change; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing access restrictions for
  change].

test-results: In UDS, privileges to change software resident within software
  libraries are strictly controlled through an immutable, version-controlled
  deployment pipeline. Software libraries are packaged into container images via
  Zarf and managed as code through OpenTofu, ensuring that any modifications
  require authorized changes to the source code subject to formal code reviews
  and approvals rather than direct alteration in production. The immutable
  nature of container images, combined with robust RBAC enforced by Kubernetes
  and Keycloak, prevents unauthorized modifications, while cryptographic signing
  verifies the integrity of the software libraries. This structured process
  ensures that only a limited set of authorized personnel can update software
  libraries, maintaining their integrity and minimizing the risk of malicious
  changes.
