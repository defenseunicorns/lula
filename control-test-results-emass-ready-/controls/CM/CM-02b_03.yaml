control-acronym: "[r5] CM-02"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop, document, and maintain under configuration control, a current
  baseline configuration of the system; and

  b. Review and update the baseline configuration of the system:

  1. [Assignment: organization-defined frequency];

  2. When required due to [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances]; and

  3. When system components are installed or upgraded.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Baseline configurations for systems and system components include
  connectivity, operational, and communications aspects of systems. Baseline
  configurations are documented, formally reviewed, and agreed-upon
  specifications for systems or configuration items within those systems.
  Baseline configurations serve as a basis for future builds, releases, or
  changes to systems and include security and privacy control implementations,
  operational procedures, information about system components, network topology,
  and logical placement of components in the system architecture. Maintaining
  baseline configurations requires creating new baselines as organizational
  systems change over time. Baseline configurations of systems reflect the
  current enterprise architecture. Related Control(s): AC-19, AU-6, CA-9, CM-1,
  CM-3, CM-5, CM-6, CM-8, CM-9, CP-9, CP-10, CP-12, MA-2, PL-8, PM-5, SA-8,
  SA-10, SA-15, SC-18.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  the baseline configuration of the system; configuration management plan;
  enterprise architecture documentation; system design documentation; system
  security plan; privacy plan; system architecture and configuration
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system component inventory; change control records; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing baseline
  configurations; mechanisms supporting configuration control of the baseline
  configuration].

  UDS inherently ensures baseline configurations are reviewed, updated, and
  maintained as an integral part of every information system component
  installation through its Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach using OpenTofu,
  combined with secure, version-controlled software and infrastructure
  deployment via signed Zarf packages. Each time new components, updates, or
  patches are installed, the baseline configuration is automatically documented,
  version-controlled, and updated accordingly. Automated enforcement by Pepr
  further ensure these configurations remain consistent and accurately reflect
  current system state, promptly detecting deviations or unauthorized changes.
  Collectively, these mechanisms ensure baseline configuration management is
  seamlessly integrated into system component installations, fully satisfying
  the intent of this control.

  UDS inherently ensures baseline configurations are reviewed, updated, and
  maintained as an integral part of each information system component upgrade.
  Utilizing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via OpenTofu, coupled with secure and
  controlled software deployments using signed Zarf packages, UDS automatically
  captures and documents any configuration updates, component changes, or
  upgrades within version-controlled repositories. These baseline configurations
  are immediately updated and consistently reflected across all deployments.
  Automated policy enforcement through Pepr further validate and ensure
  compliance with the defined baseline, rapidly detecting and responding to any
  configuration deviations. Thus, UDS fully meets the requirements of this
  control, providing seamless, integrated baseline configuration management
  during system component upgrades.
rev-4-migration-notes: "Automatically generated test result during Revision 5
  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: CM-2(1).5, CM-2(1).6; as well as the following Rev. 5 security
  requirements: CCI-003910. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because of the addition of a new security requirement to the
  assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed: CCI-003910."
