control-acronym: "[r5] CM-07(09)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Identify [Assignment: organization-defined hardware components authorized
  for system use];

  (b) Prohibit the use or connection of unauthorized hardware components;

  (c) Review and update the list of authorized hardware components [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Hardware components provide the foundation for organizational systems and the
  platform for the execution of authorized software programs. Managing the
  inventory of hardware components and controlling which hardware components are
  permitted to be installed or connected to organizational systems is essential
  in order to provide adequate security. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; network connection
  policy and procedures; configuration management plan; system security plan;
  system design documentation; system component inventory; system audit records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system hardware
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational process for approving execution of binary
  or machine-executable code; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the
  prohibition of binary or machine-executable code].
