control-acronym: "[r5] CM-07(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Review the system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to identify
  unnecessary and/or nonsecure functions, ports, protocols, software, and
  services; and

  (b) Disable or remove [Assignment: organization-defined functions, ports,
  protocols, software, and services within the system deemed to be unnecessary
  and/or nonsecure].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations review functions, ports, protocols, and services provided by
  systems or system components to determine the functions and services that are
  candidates for elimination. Such reviews are especially important during
  transition periods from older technologies to newer technologies (e.g.,
  transition from IPv4 to IPv6). These technology transitions may require
  implementing the older and newer technologies simultaneously during the
  transition period and returning to minimum essential functions, ports,
  protocols, and services at the earliest opportunity. Organizations can either
  decide the relative security of the function, port, protocol, and/or service
  or base the security decision on the assessment of other entities. Unsecure
  protocols include Bluetooth, FTP, and peer-to-peer networking. Related
  Control(s): AC-18.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  least functionality in the system; configuration management plan; system
  design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; common secure configuration checklists; documented reviews of
  functions, ports, protocols, and/or services; change control records; system
  audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  reviewing functions, ports, protocols, and services on the system;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for reviewing or disabling
  functions, ports, protocols, and services on the system; mechanisms
  implementing review and disabling of functions, ports, protocols, and/or
  services].

test-results: >-
  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: CM-7(1).1,
  CM-7(1).2. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test
  result/compliance statement: CM-7(1).1.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Though UDS provides the audit trail
  the organization must complete the review every 30 days per the implementation
  guidance.)

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.
