control-acronym: "[r5] CM-11(02)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Allow user installation of software only with explicit privileged status.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Privileged status can be obtained, for example, by serving in the role of
  system administrator. Related Control(s): AC-5, AC-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  user-installed software; configuration management plan; system security plan;
  system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; alerts/notifications of unauthorized software installations;
  system audit records; continuous monitoring strategy; system security plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  governing user-installed software; organizational personnel operating, using,
  and/or maintaining the system; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes governing user-installed software
  on the system; mechanisms for prohibiting installation of software without
  privileged status (e.g., access controls)].

compliance-status: Compliant
test-results: UDS explicitly prohibits software installation by users lacking
  explicit privileged status through robust security mechanisms. Specifically,
  software deployments and installations are managed centrally via
  Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using OpenTofu and signed Zarf packages, ensuring
  only explicitly authorized users or processes with defined privileges can
  deploy or install software components. Privilege enforcement is strictly
  controlled by identity and access management through Keycloak, ensuring only
  authorized, privileged users can approve or execute software installations.
rev-4-migration-notes: "Automatically generated test result during Revision 5
  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: CM-11(2).1; as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements:
  CCI-003980. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  of the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that
  has not been previously assessed: CCI-003980."
