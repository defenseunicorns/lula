control-acronym: "[r5] CM-03(04)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Require [Assignment: organization-defined security and privacy
  representatives] to be members of the [Assignment: organization-defined
  configuration change control element].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information security and privacy representatives include system security
  officers, senior agency information security officers, senior agency officials
  for privacy, or system privacy officers. Representation by personnel with
  information security and privacy expertise is important because changes to
  system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of which may be
  security- or privacy-relevant. Detecting such changes early in the process can
  help avoid unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the
  security and privacy posture of systems. The configuration change control
  element referred to in the second organization-defined parameter reflects the
  change control elements defined by organizations in CM-3g. Related Control(s):
  None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  system configuration change control; configuration management plan; system
  security plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration change
  control responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy responsibilities; members of change control board or similar].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for configuration change
  control].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: CM-3(4).1; as well
  as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-003921, CCI-003922,
  CCI-003923, CCI-003924. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally
  entered test result/compliance statement: CM-3(4).1. The resulting compliance
  status was set to non-compliant because of the addition of a new security
  requirement to the assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed:
  CCI-003921, CCI-003922, CCI-003923, CCI-003924.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The UDS technology stack provides
  tools to assist with configuration management, but the requirement for an
  information security representative to be a member of the organization-defined
  configuration change control element, such as a Configuration Control Board
  (CCB), is the responsibility of organization.)
