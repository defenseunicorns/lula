control-acronym: "[r5] CM-05(05)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Limit privileges to change system components and system-related
  information within a production or operational environment; and

  (b) Review and reevaluate privileges [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  In many organizations, systems support multiple mission and business
  functions. Limiting privileges to change system components with respect to
  operational systems is necessary because changes to a system component may
  have far-reaching effects on mission and business processes supported by the
  system. The relationships between systems and mission/business processes are,
  in some cases, unknown to developers. System-related information includes
  operational procedures. Related Control(s): AC-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  access restrictions for changes to the system; configuration management plan;
  system design documentation; system architecture and configuration
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  user privilege reviews; user privilege recertifications; system component
  inventory; change control records; system audit records; system security plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing access restrictions
  to change; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing access restrictions for
  change].

  UDS effectively limits privileges to change information system components
  within production or operational environments exclusively to authorized
  administrative accounts through multiple integrated security controls.
  Centralized access management via Keycloak and Kubernetes Role-Based Access
  Control (RBAC) explicitly restrict the privileges required for deploying,
  modifying, or removing infrastructure components, software, or configurations
  to only designated administrator accounts. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
  managed through OpenTofu, along with secure deployments via signed Zarf
  packages, ensures that all changes are version-controlled, reviewed, and
  implemented solely by administrative roles.

  UDS strictly limits privileges for making changes to system-related
  information within production and operational environments through a robust
  combination of identity management, role-based access control, and automated
  policy enforcement. Specifically, access and privilege assignments are
  centrally managed through Keycloak and enforced by AuthService, allowing only
  authorized personnel with designated administrative roles to modify system
  configurations or operational components. Pepr acts as the policy engine to
  enforce deployment and operational constraints within Kubernetes, preventing
  unauthorized configuration changes or deployments.
