control-acronym: "[r5] CM-10(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Establish the following restrictions on the use of open-source software:
  [Assignment: organization-defined restrictions].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Open-source software refers to software that is available in source code form.
  Certain software rights normally reserved for copyright holders are routinely
  provided under software license agreements that permit individuals to study,
  change, and improve the software. From a security perspective, the major
  advantage of open-source software is that it provides organizations with the
  ability to examine the source code. In some cases, there is an online
  community associated with the software that inspects, tests,  updates, and
  reports on issues found in software on an ongoing basis. However, remediating
  vulnerabilities in open-source software may be problematic. There may also be
  licensing issues associated with open-source software, including the
  constraints on derivative use of such software. Open-source software that is
  available only in binary form may increase the level of risk in using such
  software. Related Control(s): SI-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; software usage
  restrictions; software contract agreements and copyright laws; site license
  documentation; list of software usage restrictions; software license tracking
  reports; configuration management plan; system security plan; system security
  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel operating, using, and/or
  maintaining the system; organizational personnel with software license
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for tracking the use of software
  protected by quantity licenses; organizational processes for
  controlling/documenting the use of peer-to-peer file sharing technology;
  mechanisms implementing software license tracking; mechanisms implementing and
  controlling the use of peer-to-peer files sharing technology].
