control-acronym: "[r5] CM-07(08)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Prohibit the use of binary or machine-executable code from sources with
  limited or no warranty or without the provision of source code; and

  (b) Allow exceptions only for compelling mission or operational requirements
  and with the approval of the authorizing official.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Binary or machine executable code applies to all sources of binary or
  machine-executable code, including commercial software and firmware and
  open-source software. Organizations assess software products without
  accompanying source code or from sources with limited or no warranty for
  potential security impacts. The assessments address the fact that software
  products without the provision of source code may be difficult to review,
  repair, or extend. In addition, there may be no owners to make such repairs on
  behalf of organizations. If open-source software is used, the assessments
  address the fact that there is no warranty, the open-source software could
  contain back doors or malware, and there may be no support available. Related
  Control(s): SA-5, SA-22.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  least functionality in the system; configuration management plan; system
  security plan; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; list or record of binary or machine-executable code;
  system component inventory; common secure configuration checklists; system
  audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  determining mission and operational requirements; authorizing official for the
  system; organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  organizational personnel with software management responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational process for approving execution of binary
  or machine-executable code; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the
  prohibition of binary or machine-executable code].

test-results: UDS inherently promotes and supports transparency and traceability
  through the use of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via OpenTofu, containerized
  deployments managed with Zarf, and rigorous Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
  compliance. All components used within the UDS ecosystem are open-source or
  obtained from reputable sources, which provide comprehensive access to source
  code, documentation, and community-driven security validation. While UDS
  strongly facilitates adherence to this control, explicitly prohibiting the use
  of binary or executable code from sources without warranty or source code
  provision remains an organizational policy requirement that must be enforced
  procedurally outside the technical implementation of the UDS platform itself.

  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: SI-7(14).1; as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements:
  CCI-003955. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  of the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that
  has not been previously assessed: CCI-003955."
