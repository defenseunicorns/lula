control-information: >-
  Description:

  Manage, apply, and verify configuration settings for [Assignment:
  organization-defined system components] using [Assignment:
  organization-defined automated mechanisms].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Automated tools (e.g., hardening tools, baseline configuration tools) can
  improve the accuracy, consistency, and availability of configuration settings
  information. Automation can also provide data aggregation and data correlation
  capabilities, alerting mechanisms, and dashboards to support risk-based
  decision-making within the organization. Related Control(s): CA-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  configuration settings for the system; configuration management plan; system
  design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system component inventory; common secure configuration
  checklists; change control records; system audit records; system security
  plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators; system
  developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing configuration
  settings; automated mechanisms implemented to manage, apply, and verify system
  configuration settings].

test-results: >-
  In UDS, configuration settings for all critical system components are managed
  centrally and automatically through an integrated, declarative deployment
  pipeline. Using Infrastructure as Code with OpenTofu and Zarf, the
  organization codifies approved configuration baselines for components like
  Kubernetes, Istio, Keycloak, and NeuVector. Pepr policies are employed to
  enforce these settings during deployment and operational transitions, ensuring
  that any configuration changes are automatically validated against established
  baselines. Complementary monitoring and centralized dashboards via Prometheus,
  Grafana, and Loki provide continuous visibility and alerting for any
  deviations, ensuring that the entire environment remains compliant.

  UDS platform inherently supports automated mechanisms to centrally manage,
  apply, and verify configuration settings across its critical system
  components, including Kubernetes clusters, the Istio Service Mesh, Keycloak
  identity management, containerized applications, and associated DevSecOps
  infrastructure. Configuration management is conducted through Infrastructure
  as Code (IaC) using OpenTofu, combined with secure software distribution via
  Zarf packages. Policy enforcement is provided by Pepr, which ensures
  continuous verification and enforcement of configuration compliance.
rev-4-migration-notes: "Automatically generated test result during Revision 5
  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: CM-6(1).1, CM-6(1).2, CM-6(1).3, CM-6(1).4; as well as the
  following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-003947. The resulting compliance
  status was set to non-compliant because of the addition of a new security
  requirement to the assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed:
  CCI-003947."
