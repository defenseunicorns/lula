  Description:

  a. Develop and document an inventory of system components that:

  1. Accurately reflects the system;

  2. Includes all components within the system;

  3. Does not include duplicate accounting of components or components assigned
  to any other system;

  4. Is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting;
  and

  5. Includes the following information to achieve system component
  accountability: [Assignment: organization-defined information deemed necessary
  to achieve effective system component accountability]; and

  b. Review and update the system component inventory [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  System components are discrete, identifiable information technology assets
  that include hardware, software, and firmware. Organizations may choose to
  implement centralized system component inventories that include components
  from all organizational systems. In such situations, organizations ensure that
  the inventories include system-specific information required for component
  accountability. The information necessary for effective accountability of
  system components includes the system name, software owners, software version
  numbers, hardware inventory specifications, software license information, and
  for networked components, the machine names and network addresses across all
  implemented protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). Inventory specifications include
  date of receipt, cost, model, serial number, manufacturer, supplier
  information, component type,  and physical location.


  Preventing duplicate accounting of system components addresses the lack of
  accountability that occurs when component ownership and system association is
  not known, especially in large or complex connected systems. Effective
  prevention of duplicate accounting of system components necessitates use of a
  unique identifier for each component. For software inventory, centrally
  managed software that is accessed via other systems is addressed as a
  component of the system on which it is installed and managed. Software
  installed on multiple organizational systems and managed at the system level
  is addressed for each individual system and may appear more than once in a
  centralized component inventory, necessitating a system association for each
  software instance in the centralized inventory to avoid duplicate accounting
  of components. Scanning systems implementing multiple network protocols (e.g.,
  IPv4 and IPv6) can result in duplicate components being identified in
  different address spaces. The implementation of CM-8(7) can help to eliminate
  duplicate accounting of components. Related Control(s): CM-2, CM-7, CM-9,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  system component inventory; configuration management plan; system security
  plan; system design documentation; system component inventory; inventory
  reviews and update records; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with component inventory
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing the system component
  inventory; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing system component
  inventory].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: CM-8.4, CM-8.5; as
  well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-003967. The resulting
  compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following Rev. 4
  assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance statement:
  CM-8.5. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because of
  the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that
  has not been previously assessed: CCI-003967.


  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Though UDS provides a detailed list
  of software and components within UDS there might be others for the
  organization to report on that fall outside the boundary of UDS.)
