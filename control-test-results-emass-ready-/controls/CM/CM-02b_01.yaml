control-acronym: "[r5] CM-02"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop, document, and maintain under configuration control, a current
  baseline configuration of the system; and

  b. Review and update the baseline configuration of the system:

  1. [Assignment: organization-defined frequency];

  2. When required due to [Assignment: organization-defined circumstances]; and

  3. When system components are installed or upgraded.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Baseline configurations for systems and system components include
  connectivity, operational, and communications aspects of systems. Baseline
  configurations are documented, formally reviewed, and agreed-upon
  specifications for systems or configuration items within those systems.
  Baseline configurations serve as a basis for future builds, releases, or
  changes to systems and include security and privacy control implementations,
  operational procedures, information about system components, network topology,
  and logical placement of components in the system architecture. Maintaining
  baseline configurations requires creating new baselines as organizational
  systems change over time. Baseline configurations of systems reflect the
  current enterprise architecture. Related Control(s): AC-19, AU-6, CA-9, CM-1,

  SA-10, SA-15, SC-18.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  the baseline configuration of the system; configuration management plan;
  enterprise architecture documentation; system design documentation; system
  security plan; privacy plan; system architecture and configuration
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system component inventory; change control records; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing baseline
  configurations; mechanisms supporting configuration control of the baseline
  configuration].

  UDS provides strong technical support for annual reviews and updates of the
  baseline configuration through its Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach using
  OpenTofu and secure deployment with signed Zarf packages. These tools
  inherently facilitate the version-controlled documentation of software and
  infrastructure components, clearly recording baseline configurations,
  hardware, software versions, and dependencies. Additionally, UDS generates
  Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) to document and test the baseline
  configuration, ensuring that all components are accounted for and properly
  configured. Since UDS is updated frequently organizations are compliant with
  the DoD has defined the frequency as annually.


  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.
