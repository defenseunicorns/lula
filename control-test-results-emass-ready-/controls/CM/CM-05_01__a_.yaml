control-acronym: "[r5] CM-05(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Enforce access restrictions using [Assignment: organization-defined
  automated mechanisms]; and

  (b) Automatically generate audit records of the enforcement actions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations log system accesses associated with applying configuration
  changes to ensure that configuration change control is implemented and to
  support after-the-fact actions should organizations discover any unauthorized
  changes. Related Control(s): AU-2, AU-6, AU-7, AU-12, CM-6, CM-11, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  access restrictions for changes to the system; system design documentation;
  system architecture and configuration documentation; system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; change control records; system audit
  records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with logical access control
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with physical access control
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing access restrictions
  to change; automated mechanisms implementing the enforcement of access
  restrictions for changes to the system; automated mechanisms supporting
  auditing of enforcement actions].

test-results: UDS effectively enforces access restrictions throughout the
  platform using multiple integrated technical mechanisms. Centralized
  authentication and authorization are managed by Keycloak, ensuring strict
  enforcement of user and role-based access controls. Kubernetes RBAC explicitly
  restricts permissions for users, applications, and services within the cluster
  environment, limiting access strictly to authorized resources and actions.
  Istio Service Mesh enhances this enforcement through fine-grained
  authorization policies and mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication, strictly
  controlling service-to-service communications. Additionally, the policy
  enforcement engine Pepr and runtime monitoring by NeuVector proactively detect
  and prevent unauthorized access attempts or policy deviations, ensuring
  continuous enforcement of access restrictions. These comprehensive security
  measures collectively fulfill the intent of this control.
rev-4-migration-notes: "Automatically generated test result during Revision 5
  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: CM-5(1).1; as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements:
  CCI-003937. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  of the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that
  has not been previously assessed: CCI-003937."
