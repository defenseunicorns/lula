control-acronym: "[r5] CM-08(03)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Detect the presence of unauthorized hardware, software, and firmware
  components within the system using [Assignment: organization-defined automated
  mechanisms] [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and

  (b) Take the following actions when unauthorized components are detected:
  [Selection (one or more): disable network access by such components; isolate
  the components; notify [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Automated unauthorized component detection is applied in addition to the
  monitoring for unauthorized remote connections and mobile devices. Monitoring
  for unauthorized system components may be accomplished on an ongoing basis or
  by the periodic scanning of systems for that purpose. Automated mechanisms may
  also be used to prevent the connection of unauthorized components (see
  CM-7(9)). Automated mechanisms can be implemented in systems or in separate
  system components. When acquiring and implementing automated mechanisms,
  organizations consider whether such mechanisms depend on the ability of the
  system component to support an agent or supplicant in order to be detected
  since some types of components do not have or cannot support agents (e.g., IoT
  devices, sensors). Isolation can be achieved , for example, by placing
  unauthorized system components in separate domains or subnets or quarantining
  such components. This type of component isolation is commonly referred to as
  sandboxing. Related Control(s): AC-19, CA-7, RA-5, SC-3, SC-39, SC-44, SI-3,
  SI-4, SI-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  system component inventory; configuration management plan; system design
  documentation; system security plan; system component inventory; change
  control records; alerts/notifications of unauthorized components within the
  system; system monitoring records; system maintenance records; system audit
  records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with component inventory
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibilities
  for managing the automated mechanisms implementing unauthorized system
  component detection; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for detection of unauthorized
  system components; organizational processes for taking action when
  unauthorized system components are detected; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing the detection of unauthorized system components; automated
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing actions taken when unauthorized
  system components are detected].
