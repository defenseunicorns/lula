control-acronym: "[r5] CM-11"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Establish [Assignment: organization-defined policies] governing the
  installation of software by users;

  b. Enforce software installation policies through the following methods:
  [Assignment: organization-defined methods]; and

  c. Monitor policy compliance [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  If provided the necessary privileges, users can install software in
  organizational systems. To maintain control over the software installed,
  organizations identify permitted and prohibited actions regarding software
  installation. Permitted software installations include updates and security
  patches to existing software and downloading new applications from
  organization-approved app stores. Prohibited software installations include
  software with unknown or suspect pedigrees or software that organizations
  consider potentially malicious. Policies selected for governing user-installed
  software are organization-developed or provided by some external entity.
  Policy enforcement methods can include procedural methods and automated
  methods. Related Control(s): AC-3, AU-6, CM-2, CM-3, CM-5, CM-6, CM-7, CM-8,
  PL-4, SI-4, SI-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  user-installed software; configuration management plan; system security plan;
  system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; list of rules governing user installed software; system
  monitoring records; system audit records; continuous monitoring strategy;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  governing user-installed software; organizational personnel operating, using,
  and/or maintaining the system; organizational personnel monitoring compliance
  with user-installed software policy; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes governing user-installed software
  on the system; mechanisms enforcing policies and methods for governing the
  installation of software by users; mechanisms monitoring policy compliance].

test-results: >-
  Regular users of UDS have no ability to install software on the system. They
  interact with deployed applications but cannot add new applications
  themselves. For instance, a user using a web app served by UDS can't install
  anything on the server hosting it. Installation of software requires
  administrative privileges and goes through the controlled deployment
  mechanism. 

  UDS enforces organizationally defined software installation policies through
  its robust Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach using OpenTofu and secure
  software deployment via cryptographically signed and verified Zarf packages.
  Software installations are strictly controlled, version-managed, and audited,
  ensuring that only explicitly approved software components and container
  images are deployed within Kubernetes clusters.
