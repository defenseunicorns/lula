control-acronym: "[r5] CM-05(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Enforce access restrictions using [Assignment: organization-defined
  automated mechanisms]; and

  (b) Automatically generate audit records of the enforcement actions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations log system accesses associated with applying configuration
  changes to ensure that configuration change control is implemented and to
  support after-the-fact actions should organizations discover any unauthorized
  changes. Related Control(s): AU-2, AU-6, AU-7, AU-12, CM-6, CM-11, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  access restrictions for changes to the system; system design documentation;
  system architecture and configuration documentation; system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; change control records; system audit
  records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with logical access control
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with physical access control
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing access restrictions
  to change; automated mechanisms implementing the enforcement of access
  restrictions for changes to the system; automated mechanisms supporting
  auditing of enforcement actions].

test-results: UDS fully supports comprehensive auditing of enforcement actions
  through integrated logging, monitoring, and audit capabilities. Enforcement
  actions performed by the platform including identity and access control
  decisions via Keycloak, Kubernetes RBAC policy enforcement, and Istio
  authorization policy enforcement generate detailed audit records. These
  records include timestamps, user identities, actions taken, source/destination
  details, and success or failure outcomes. Audit data is systematically
  collected via Vector, centrally stored and indexed in Loki, and presented
  visually in Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring and retrospective
  analysis. Runtime security enforcement provided by NeuVector and policy
  enforcement by Pepr also produce auditable events, enhancing the traceability
  of enforcement actions. Collectively, these capabilities ensure robust
  auditing support, fully meeting the intent of this control.
rev-4-migration-notes: "Automatically generated test result during Revision 5
  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: CM-5(1).2; as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements:
  CCI-003938. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  of the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that
  has not been previously assessed: CCI-003938."
