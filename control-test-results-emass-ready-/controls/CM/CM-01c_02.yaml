control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop, document, and disseminate to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles]:

  1. [Selection (one or more): Organization-level; Mission/business
  process-level; System-level] configuration management policy that:
    (a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
    (b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and
  2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the configuration management
  policy and the associated configuration management controls;

  b. Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the
  development, documentation, and dissemination of the configuration management
  policy and procedures; and

  c. Review and update the current configuration management:

  1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events]; and

  2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Configuration management policy and procedures address the controls in the CM
  family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk
  management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and
  procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy
  assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs
  collaborate on the development of configuration management policy and
  procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the
  organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for
  mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be
  included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented
  by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations.
  Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for
  mission/business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe
  how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the
  individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be
  documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
  documents. Events that may precipitate an update to configuration management
  policy and procedures include, but are not limited to, assessment or audit
  findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws,
  executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and
  guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational
  policy or procedure. Related Control(s): PM-9, PS-8, SA-8, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy and procedures;
  security and privacy program policies and procedures; assessment or audit
  findings; documentation of security incidents or breaches; system security
  plan; privacy plan; risk management strategy; other relevant artifacts,
  documents, or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities].
