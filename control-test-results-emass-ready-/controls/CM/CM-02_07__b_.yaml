control-acronym: "[r5] CM-02(07)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Issue [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components] with
  [Assignment: organization-defined configurations] to individuals traveling to
  locations that the organization deems to be of significant risk; and

  (b) Apply the following controls to the systems or components when the
  individuals return from travel: [Assignment: organization-defined controls].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  When it is known that systems or system components will be in high-risk areas
  external to the organization, additional controls may be implemented to
  counter the increased threat in such areas. For example, organizations can
  take actions for notebook computers used by individuals departing on and
  returning from travel. Actions include determining the locations that are of
  concern, defining the required configurations for the components, ensuring
  that components are configured as intended before travel is initiated, and
  applying controls to the components after travel is completed. Specially
  configured notebook computers include computers with sanitized hard drives,
  limited applications, and more stringent configuration settings. Controls
  applied to mobile devices upon return from travel include examining the mobile
  device for signs of physical tampering and purging and reimaging disk drives.
  Protecting information that resides on mobile devices is addressed in the MP
  (Media Protection) family. Related Control(s): MP-4, MP-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; configuration
  management plan; procedures addressing the baseline configuration of the
  system; procedures addressing system component installations and upgrades;
  system architecture and configuration documentation; system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; system component inventory; records of
  system baseline configuration reviews and updates; system component
  installations/upgrades and associated records; change control records; system
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing baseline
  configurations].
