control-information: >-
  Description:

  Provide and implement the capability to centrally review and analyze audit
  records from multiple components within the system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Automated mechanisms for centralized reviews and analyses include Security
  Information and Event Management products. Related Control(s): AU-2, AU-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit review, analysis, and reporting; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system security plan;
  privacy plan; system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit review, analysis,
  and reporting responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: System capability to centralize review and analysis of
  audit records].

test-results: UDS provides centralized audit log review and analysis
  capabilities using a combination of Loki for log aggregation, Vector for log
  collection and transformation, and Grafana for visualization and analysis.
  These components ensure that audit records from multiple system components,
  including authentication logs from Keycloak, network activity logs from Istio,
  and security events from NeuVector, are collected, normalized, and centrally
  accessible. This enables security teams to efficiently correlate events,
  detect anomalies, and respond to incidents

  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: AU-6(4).1; as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements:
  CCI-003821. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  of the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that
  has not been previously assessed: CCI-003821."
