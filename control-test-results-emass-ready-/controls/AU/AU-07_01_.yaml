control-information: >-
  Description:

  Provide and implement the capability to process, sort, and search audit
  records for events of interest based on the following content: [Assignment:
  organization-defined fields within audit records].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Events of interest can be identified by the content of audit records,
  including system resources involved, information objects accessed, identities
  of individuals, event types, event locations, event dates and times, Internet
  Protocol addresses involved, or event success or failure. Organizations may
  define event criteria to any degree of granularity required, such as locations
  selectable by a general networking location or by specific system component.
  Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; system security plan;
  privacy plan; procedures addressing audit reduction and report generation;
  system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; audit reduction, review, analysis, and reporting tools; audit
  record criteria (fields) establishing events of interest; system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit reduction and
  report generation responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Audit reduction and report generation capability].

  Determine if:

  - the capability to process, sort, and search audit records for events of
  interest based on [Assignment: organization-defined fields within audit
  records] are provided.

  - the capability to process, sort, and search audit records for events of
  interest based on [Assignment: organization-defined fields within audit

  The UDS platform provides the capability to process audit records for events
  of interest through its integration with Vector and Loki. Vector collects and
  processes logs based on organization-defined audit fields, ensuring that data
  remains unaltered and preserving the integrity of the original audit records.
  Loki stores these logs in a time-sequenced manner, maintaining chronological
  integrity and enabling accurate forensic analysis. The logs can then be
  visualized in Grafana for deeper analysis.

  UDS provides extensive audit logging capabilities through its integrated
  logging and monitoring components (Vector and Loki), enabling comprehensive
  capture of audit fields including user identity, timestamps,
  source/destination addresses, actions performed, and authentication outcomes.
  UDS allows administrators to configure and define precisely which audit fields
  are collected, processed, and analyzed, ensuring logs contain sufficient
  details to investigate security events thoroughly.
rev-4-migration-notes: "Automatically generated test result during Revision 5
  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: AU-7(1).1, AU-7(1).2; as well as the following Rev. 5 security
  requirements: CCI-003830. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because of the addition of a new security requirement to the
  assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed: CCI-003830."
