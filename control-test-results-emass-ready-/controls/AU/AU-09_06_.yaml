control-information: >-
  Description:

  Authorize read-only access to audit information to [Assignment:
  organization-defined subset of privileged users or roles].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Restricting privileged user or role authorizations to read-only helps to limit
  the potential damage to organizations that could be initiated by such users or
  roles, such as deleting audit records to cover up malicious activity. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; system security plan;
  privacy plan; access control policy and procedures; procedures addressing
  protection of audit information; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system-generated list of
  privileged users with read-only access to audit information; access
  authorizations; access control list; system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms managing access to audit information].
