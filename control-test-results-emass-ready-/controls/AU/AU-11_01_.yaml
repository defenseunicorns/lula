control-acronym: "[r5] AU-11(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Employ [Assignment: organization-defined measures] to ensure that long-term
  audit records generated by the system can be retrieved.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations need to access and read audit records requiring long-term
  storage (on the order of years). Measures employed to help facilitate the
  retrieval of audit records include converting records to newer formats,
  retaining equipment capable of reading the records, and retaining the
  necessary documentation to help personnel understand how to interpret the
  records. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; system security plan;
  privacy plan; audit record retention policy and procedures; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  audit record archives; audit logs; audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit record retention
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing audit record retention
  capability].
