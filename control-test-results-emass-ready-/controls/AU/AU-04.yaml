control-information: >-
  Description:

  Allocate audit log storage capacity to accommodate [Assignment:
  organization-defined audit log retention requirements].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations consider the types of audit logging to be performed and the
  audit log processing requirements when allocating audit log storage capacity.
  Allocating sufficient audit log storage capacity reduces the likelihood of
  such capacity being exceeded and resulting in the potential loss or reduction
  of audit logging capability. Related Control(s): AU-2, AU-5, AU-6, AU-7, AU-9,
  AU-11, AU-12, AU-14, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit storage capacity; system security plan; privacy plan; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  audit record storage requirements; audit record storage capability for system
  components; system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators; system
  developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Audit record storage capacity and related configuration
  settings].
