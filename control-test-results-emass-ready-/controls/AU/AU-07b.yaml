control-acronym: "[r5] AU-07"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Provide and implement an audit record reduction and report generation
  capability that:

  a. Supports on-demand audit record review, analysis, and reporting
  requirements and after-the-fact investigations of incidents; and

  b. Does not alter the original content or time ordering of audit records.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit record reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit log
  information and organizes it into a summary format that is more meaningful to
  analysts. Audit record reduction and report generation capabilities do not
  always emanate from the same system or from the same organizational entities
  that conduct audit logging activities. The audit record reduction capability
  includes modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to identify
  anomalous behavior in audit records. The report generation capability provided
  by the system can generate customizable reports. Time ordering of audit
  records can be an issue if the granularity of the timestamp in the record is
  insufficient. Related Control(s): AC-2, AU-2, AU-3, AU-4, AU-5, AU-6, AU-12,
  AU-16, CM-5, IA-5, IR-4, PM-12, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; system security plan;
  privacy plan; procedures addressing audit reduction and report generation;
  system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; audit reduction, review, analysis, and reporting tools; system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit reduction and
  report generation responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Audit reduction and report generation capability].

  Determine if:

  - an audit record reduction and report generation capability is provided that
  does not alter the original content or time ordering of audit records.

  - an audit record reduction and report generation capability is implemented
  that does not alter the original content or time ordering of audit records.

compliance-status: Need Review
test-results: The UDS platform ensures that its audit reduction capability
  maintains the integrity of original audit records, preserving both content and
  time ordering, through its Vector, Loki, and Grafana stack. Vector collects
  and processes logs without modifying their original structure, ensuring that
  data remains unaltered. Loki stores logs in a time-sequenced manner,
  maintaining chronological integrity and enabling accurate forensic analysis.

  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: AU-7.7, AU-7.8; as well as the following Rev. 5 security
  requirements: CCI-003828, CCI-003829. The resulting compliance status was set
  to non-compliant because of the addition of a new security requirement to the
  assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed: CCI-003828,
  CCI-003829."
