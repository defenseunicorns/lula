control-information: >-
  Description:

  Provide cross-organizational audit information to [Assignment:
  organization-defined organizations] based on [Assignment: organization-defined
  cross-organizational sharing agreements].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Due to the distributed nature of the audit information, cross-organization
  sharing of audit information may be essential for effective analysis of the
  auditing being performed. For example, the audit records of one organization
  may not provide sufficient information to determine the appropriate or
  inappropriate use of organizational information resources by individuals in
  other organizations. In some instances, only individualsâ€™ home organizations
  have the appropriate knowledge to make such determinations, thus requiring the
  sharing of audit information among organizations. Related Control(s): IR-4,
  SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; system security plan;
  privacy plan; procedures addressing cross-organizational sharing of audit
  information; information sharing agreements; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  sharing cross-organizational audit information; organizational personnel with
  information security and privacy responsibilities].
