control-acronym: "[r5] AU-12"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Provide audit record generation capability for the event types the system
  is capable of auditing as defined in AU-2a on [Assignment:
  organization-defined system components];

  b. Allow [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to select the
  event types that are to be logged by specific components of the system; and

  c. Generate audit records for the event types defined in AU-2c that include
  the audit record content defined in AU-3.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit records can be generated from many different system components. The
  event types specified in AU-2d are the event types for which audit logs are to
  be generated and are a subset of all event types for which the system can
  generate audit records. Related Control(s): AC-6, AC-17, AU-2, AU-3, AU-4,
  AU-5, AU-6, AU-7, AU-14, CM-5, MA-4, MP-4, PM-12, SA-8, SC-18, SI-3, SI-4,
  SI-7, SI-10.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit record generation; system security plan; privacy plan; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  list of auditable events; system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit record generation
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing audit record generation
  capability].

  The UDS platform provides comprehensive audit record generation capabilities
  for the auditable events defined in AU-2 across all information system and
  network components. The platform allows designated personnel or roles to
  select which auditable events are to be audited by specific components,
  ensuring flexibility and granularity in audit record generation. Key events
  that are audited include user authentication and access attempts, system and
  application access, configuration changes, data and resource access, network
  activity, security events, system and application errors, and audit and log
  management activities.

  Logs from various components, such as Keycloak, Kubernetes, and NeuVector, are
  collected using Vector and aggregated in Loki. These logs are then visualized
  in Grafana, providing detailed insights into the actions performed within the
  system. The content of the audit records includes essential details such as
  timestamps, user IDs, event types, and outcomes, fulfilling the content
  requirements defined in AU-3. This comprehensive approach ensures that all
  relevant events are captured and can be reviewed, analyzed, and reported as
  needed, in compliance with the control requirements.


  UDS includes comprehensive audit record generation capabilities across its key
  system components. Specifically, components such as Keycloak (for identity
  management), Istio Service Mesh (for network traffic and policy enforcement),
  NeuVector (for container security monitoring), Kubernetes itself (for resource
  access and configuration management), and integrated logging solutions (Vector
  and Loki) collectively provide detailed and structured audit records of
  security-relevant events. Audit records include user authentication events,
  resource access attempts, configuration changes, and runtime anomalies.
