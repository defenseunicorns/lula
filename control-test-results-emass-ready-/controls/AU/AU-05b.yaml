control-acronym: "[r5] AU-05"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Alert [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] within
  [Assignment: organization-defined time period] in the event of an audit
  logging process failure; and

  b. Take the following additional actions: [Assignment: organization-defined
  additional actions].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit logging process failures include software and hardware errors, failures
  in audit log capturing mechanisms, and reaching or exceeding audit log storage
  capacity. Organization-defined actions include overwriting oldest audit
  records, shutting down the system, and stopping the generation of audit
  records. Organizations may choose to define additional actions for audit
  logging process failures based on the type of failure, the location of the
  failure, the severity of the failure, or a combination of such factors. When
  the audit logging process failure is related to storage, the response is
  carried out for the audit log storage repository (i.e., the distinct system
  component where the audit logs are stored), the system on which the audit logs
  reside, the total audit log storage capacity of the organization (i.e., all
  audit log storage repositories combined), or all three. Organizations may
  decide to take no additional actions after alerting designated roles or
  personnel. Related Control(s): AU-2, AU-4, AU-7, AU-9, AU-11, AU-12, AU-14,
  SI-4, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  response to audit processing failures; system design documentation; system
  security plan; privacy plan; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; list of personnel to be notified in case of an audit processing
  failure; system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators; system
  developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing system response to audit
  processing failures].
