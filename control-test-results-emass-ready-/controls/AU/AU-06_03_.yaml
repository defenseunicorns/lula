control-information: >-
  Description:

  Analyze and correlate audit records across different repositories to gain
  organization-wide situational awareness.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organization-wide situational awareness includes awareness across all three
  levels of risk management (i.e., organizational level, mission/business
  process level, and information system level) and supports cross-organization
  awareness. Related Control(s): AU-12, IR-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; system security plan;
  privacy plan; procedures addressing audit review, analysis, and reporting;
  system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system audit records across different repositories; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit review, analysis,
  and reporting responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting the analysis and correlation of
  audit records].
