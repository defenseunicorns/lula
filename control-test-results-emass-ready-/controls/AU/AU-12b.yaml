control-acronym: "[r5] AU-12"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Provide audit record generation capability for the event types the system
  is capable of auditing as defined in AU-2a on [Assignment:
  organization-defined system components];

  b. Allow [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to select the
  event types that are to be logged by specific components of the system; and

  c. Generate audit records for the event types defined in AU-2c that include
  the audit record content defined in AU-3.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit records can be generated from many different system components. The
  event types specified in AU-2d are the event types for which audit logs are to
  be generated and are a subset of all event types for which the system can
  generate audit records. Related Control(s): AC-6, AC-17, AU-2, AU-3, AU-4,
  AU-5, AU-6, AU-7, AU-14, CM-5, MA-4, MP-4, PM-12, SA-8, SC-18, SI-3, SI-4,
  SI-7, SI-10.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit record generation; system security plan; privacy plan; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  list of auditable events; system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit record generation
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing audit record generation
  capability].

  All UDS components are configured to generate the necessary audit records. The
  system by default logs security-relevant events without requiring custom
  development. For instance, Keycloak generates login/logout events, NeuVector
  generates security incident logs, and Kubernetes (with auditing enabled) can
  log API calls. UDSâ€™s integration of these tools ensures audit records are
  generated automatically during normal operation. The presence of multiple
  auditing sources (identity, network, container security) means UDS
  comprehensively covers audit generation for various event types.

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.
