control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Identify the types of events that the system is capable of logging in
  support of the audit function: [Assignment: organization-defined event types
  that the system is capable of logging];

  b. Coordinate the event logging function with other organizational entities
  requiring audit-related information to guide and inform the selection criteria
  for events to be logged;

  c. Specify the following event types for logging within the system:
  [Assignment: organization-defined event types (subset of the event types
  defined in AU-2a.) along with the frequency of (or situation requiring)
  logging for each identified event type];

  d. Provide a rationale for why the event types selected for logging are deemed
  to be adequate to support after-the-fact investigations of incidents; and

  e. Review and update the event types selected for logging [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  An event is an observable occurrence in a system. The types of events that
  require logging are those events that are significant and relevant to the
  security of systems and the privacy of individuals. Event logging also
  supports specific monitoring and auditing needs. Event types include password
  changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, security or
  privacy attribute changes, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential
  usage, data action changes, query parameters, or external credential usage. In
  determining the set of event types that require logging, organizations
  consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of the controls to
  be implemented. For completeness, event logging includes all protocols that
  are operational and supported by the system.


  To balance monitoring and auditing requirements with other system needs, event
  logging requires identifying the subset of event types that are logged at a
  given point in time. For example, organizations may determine that systems
  need the capability to log every file access successful and unsuccessful, but
  not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the
  potential burden on system performance. The types of events that organizations
  desire to be logged may change. Reviewing and updating the set of logged
  events is necessary to help ensure that the events remain relevant and
  continue to support the needs of the organization. Organizations consider how
  the types of logging events can reveal information about individuals that may
  give rise to privacy risk and how best to mitigate such risks. For example,
  there is the potential to reveal personally identifiable information in the
  audit trail, especially if the logging event is based on patterns or time of
  usage.


  Event logging requirements, including the need to log specific event types,
  may be referenced in other controls and control enhancements. These include
  AC-2(4), AC-3(10), AC-6(9), AC-17(1), CM-3f, CM-5(1), IA-3(3)(b), MA-4(1),
  MP-4(2), PE-3, PM-21, PT-7, RA-8, SC-7(9), SC-7(15), SI-3(8), SI-4(22),
  SI-7(8), and SI-10(1). Organizations include event types that are required by
  applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations,
  standards, and guidelines. Audit records can be generated at various levels,
  including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting
  the appropriate level of event logging is an important part of a monitoring
  and auditing capability and can identify the root causes of problems. When
  defining event types, organizations consider the logging necessary to cover
  related event types, such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based
  processes and the actions that occur in service-oriented architectures.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  auditable events; system security plan; privacy plan; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system audit records; system auditable events; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing system auditing].
