control-acronym: "[r5] AU-07"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Provide and implement an audit record reduction and report generation
  capability that:

  a. Supports on-demand audit record review, analysis, and reporting
  requirements and after-the-fact investigations of incidents; and

  b. Does not alter the original content or time ordering of audit records.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit record reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit log
  information and organizes it into a summary format that is more meaningful to
  analysts. Audit record reduction and report generation capabilities do not
  always emanate from the same system or from the same organizational entities
  that conduct audit logging activities. The audit record reduction capability
  includes modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to identify
  anomalous behavior in audit records. The report generation capability provided
  by the system can generate customizable reports. Time ordering of audit
  records can be an issue if the granularity of the timestamp in the record is
  insufficient. Related Control(s): AC-2, AU-2, AU-3, AU-4, AU-5, AU-6, AU-12,
  AU-16, CM-5, IA-5, IR-4, PM-12, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; system security plan;
  privacy plan; procedures addressing audit reduction and report generation;
  system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; audit reduction, review, analysis, and reporting tools; system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit reduction and
  report generation responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities].

  Determine if:

  - an audit record reduction and report generation capability is provided that
  supports on-demand audit record review, analysis, and reporting requirements
  and after-the-fact investigations of incidents.

  - if an audit record reduction and report generation capability is implemented
  that supports on-demand audit record review, analysis, and reporting
  requirements and after-the-fact investigations of incidents.

  The presence of a centralized logging system (Loki) means that raw logs can be
  filtered and processed to produce more concise output for reporting. Loki’s
  query language and Grafana’s interface allow auditors to reduce audit log
  volume by focusing on specific criteria (e.g., showing only security-related
  events, or aggregating repetitive events). For example, one can query “count
  of failed logins per day” instead of reviewing every log line, which reduces
  the data to be reviewed.

  UDS platform provides an audit reduction capability through its integrated
  logging and monitoring stack, including Vector, Loki, and Grafana, which
  collectively support on-demand reporting. Vector efficiently collects,
  transforms, and routes log data, while Loki indexes and stores logs for quick
  retrieval. Grafana provides a user-friendly interface for querying and
  visualizing audit logs. 

  The UDS platform ensures robust audit reduction capabilities to support
  after-the-fact security investigations through its Vector, Loki, Prometheus,
  and Grafana logging and monitoring stack. Vector efficiently processes and
  normalizes log data before forwarding it to Loki, which indexes and stores
  logs for historical analysis. Security teams can query these logs in Grafana,
  leveraging filtering and visualization tools to reconstruct security events.

  The UDS platform provides a robust report generation capability for on-demand
  audit review and analysis through its integrated Vector, Loki, and Grafana
  stack. Loki stores and indexes logs, enabling quick searches and filtering
  based on specific events, while Vector ensures efficient log aggregation and
  transformation. Grafana offers customizable dashboards and reporting features,
  allowing security teams to generate audit reports.
