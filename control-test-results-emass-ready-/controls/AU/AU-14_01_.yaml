control-information: >-
  Description:

  Initiate session audits automatically at system start-up.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The automatic initiation of session audits at startup helps to ensure that the
  information being captured on selected individuals is complete and not subject
  to compromise through tampering by malicious threat actors. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; system security plan;
  privacy plan; procedures addressing user session auditing; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators; system
  developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing user session auditing capability].

test-results: The UDS platform is configured to initiate session audits at
  system start-up, ensuring that all relevant session activities are logged from
  the beginning of system operation. This capability is implemented across all
  components of the UDS platform, including Keycloak, Kubernetes, and NeuVector.
  Upon start-up, these components generate audit logs that capture session
  initiation and other relevant activities. The logs are collected using Vector
  and aggregated in Loki, providing a centralized repository for audit records.
  These logs can be visualized and analyzed in Grafana, offering insights into
  session activities and ensuring that session audits are conducted consistently
  from system start-up.
