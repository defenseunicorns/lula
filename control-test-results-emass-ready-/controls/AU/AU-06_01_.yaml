  Description:

  Integrate audit record review, analysis, and reporting processes using
  [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizational processes that benefit from integrated audit record review,
  analysis, and reporting include incident response, continuous monitoring,
  contingency planning, investigation and response to suspicious activities, and
  Inspector General audits. Related Control(s): PM-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; system security plan;
  privacy plan; procedures addressing audit review, analysis, and reporting;
  procedures addressing investigation and response to suspicious activities;
  system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit review, analysis,
  and reporting responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms integrating audit review, analysis,
  and reporting processes].

  With UDS, you can automate certain aspects of audit analysis using
  Prometheus/Grafana. For instance, you can create Grafana alerts that trigger
  when certain audit events occur, such as “alert me if more than 5 failed admin
  logins happen in 1 hour” or “if a normally inactive account suddenly logs in.”
  NeuVector adds automated security analysis as well it monitors runtime events
  and flags suspicious behaviors (which is an automated analysis of system
  events for live traffic). By leveraging these tools, the system does perform
  initial analysis and can notify security personnel of potential issues.
  Essentially, UDS provides a form of continuous monitoring that goes
  hand-in-hand with audit logs and events are not just recorded but can prompt
  automatic responses (like alerts) when they meet certain criteria. This
  satisfies the idea of ongoing automated audit analysis.

  UDS supports alerts and notifications that a form of automated mechanisms to
  trigger report notifications in a reporting process to support the
  organizations investigation.
rev-4-migration-notes: "Automatically generated test result during Revision 5
  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: AU-6(1).1, AU-6(1).2; as well as the following Rev. 5 security
  requirements: CCI-003820. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because of the addition of a new security requirement to the
  assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed: CCI-003820."
