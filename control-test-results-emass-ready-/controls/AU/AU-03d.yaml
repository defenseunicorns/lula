control-acronym: "[r5] AU-03"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Ensure that audit records contain information that establishes the following:

  a. What type of event occurred;

  b. When the event occurred;

  c. Where the event occurred;

  d. Source of the event;

  e. Outcome of the event; and

  f. Identity of any individuals, subjects, or objects/entities associated with
  the event.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit record content that may be necessary to support the auditing function
  includes event descriptions (item a), time stamps (item b), source and
  destination addresses (item c), user or process identifiers (items d and f),
  success or fail indications (item e), and filenames involved (items a, c, e,
  and f) . Event outcomes include indicators of event success or failure and
  event-specific results, such as the system security and privacy posture after
  the event occurred. Organizations consider how audit records can reveal
  information about individuals that may give rise to privacy risks and how best
  to mitigate such risks. For example, there is the potential to reveal
  personally identifiable information in the audit trail, especially if the
  trail records inputs or is based on patterns or time of usage. Related

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; system security plan;
  privacy plan; procedures addressing content of audit records; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  list of organization-defined auditable events; system audit records; system
  incident reports; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing system auditing of auditable
  events].

test-results: Audit log content provided by UDS components typically includes
  required details. Logs from Keycloak, for instance, contain timestamp, user
  ID, event type, outcome (success/failure) and source IP for each login attempt
  or admin action. Kubernetes audit logs (if enabled) include the API method
  invoked, the request parameters, the user/service account who made the
  request, timestamp, and outcome code. NeuVectorâ€™s security event logs include
  what was detected/blocked, which container, and when. With Loki aggregating
  these, each audit record can be examined to see what event occurred, when, by
  whom, from where, and the result, fulfilling the content requirements. If
  needed, logs can also show object affected (e.g., which resource was changed
  in Kubernetes). Therefore, UDS can produce audit records with sufficient
  content to meet audit requirements. The exact schema varies by component, but
  collectively they provide comprehensive details.
