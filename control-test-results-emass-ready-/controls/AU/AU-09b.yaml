control-acronym: "[r5] AU-09"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Protect audit information and audit logging tools from unauthorized access,
  modification, and deletion; and

  b. Alert [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] upon detection
  of unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of audit information.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit information includes all information needed to successfully audit system
  activity, such as audit records, audit log settings, audit reports, and
  personally identifiable information. Audit logging tools are those programs
  and devices used to conduct system audit and logging activities. Protection of
  audit information focuses on technical protection and limits the ability to
  access and execute audit logging tools to authorized individuals. Physical
  protection of audit information is addressed by both media protection controls
  and physical and environmental protection controls. Related Control(s): AC-3,
  AC-6, AU-6, AU-11, AU-14, AU-15, MP-2, MP-4, PE-2, PE-3, PE-6, SA-8, SC-8,
  SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; system security plan;
  privacy plan; access control policy and procedures; procedures addressing
  protection of audit information; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit records;
  audit tools; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators; system
  developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing audit information protection].
