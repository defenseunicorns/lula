control-information: >-
  Description:

  Retain audit records for [Assignment: organization-defined time period
  consistent with records retention policy] to provide support for
  after-the-fact investigations of incidents and to meet regulatory and
  organizational information retention requirements.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations retain audit records until it is determined that the records are
  no longer needed for administrative, legal, audit, or other operational
  purposes. This includes the retention and availability of audit records
  relative to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, subpoenas, and law
  enforcement actions. Organizations develop standard categories of audit
  records relative to such types of actions and standard response processes for
  each type of action. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)
  General Records Schedules provide federal policy on records retention. Related
  Control(s): AU-2, AU-4, AU-5, AU-6, AU-9, AU-14, MP-6, RA-5, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
