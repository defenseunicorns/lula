control-acronym: "[r5] AU-12"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Provide audit record generation capability for the event types the system
  is capable of auditing as defined in AU-2a on [Assignment:
  organization-defined system components];

  b. Allow [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to select the
  event types that are to be logged by specific components of the system; and

  c. Generate audit records for the event types defined in AU-2c that include
  the audit record content defined in AU-3.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit records can be generated from many different system components. The
  event types specified in AU-2d are the event types for which audit logs are to
  be generated and are a subset of all event types for which the system can
  generate audit records. Related Control(s): AC-6, AC-17, AU-2, AU-3, AU-4,
  AU-5, AU-6, AU-7, AU-14, CM-5, MA-4, MP-4, PM-12, SA-8, SC-18, SI-3, SI-4,
  SI-7, SI-10.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit record generation; system security plan; privacy plan; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  list of auditable events; system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit record generation
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing audit record generation
  capability].

test-results: UDS generates comprehensive audit records aligned with the event
  categories defined in AU-2(d), including successful and unsuccessful user
  authentication attempts, account management actions, access control decisions,
  administrative configuration changes, system startup/shutdown events, and
  other critical security events. These records contain all necessary content
  required by AU-3, such as timestamps, user identities, event descriptions,
  source and destination addresses, event outcomes, and associated system
  components. Specifically, detailed audit logs are captured through Vector,
  aggregated and securely stored in Loki, and made searchable through Grafana
  dashboards. Identity management via Keycloak, runtime protection via
  NeuVector, and infrastructure management provided by Kubernetes and Istio
  Service Mesh collectively ensure comprehensive and accurate audit log
  coverage, meeting the full intent of this control.
