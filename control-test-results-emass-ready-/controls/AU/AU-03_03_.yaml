  Limit personally identifiable information contained in audit records to the
  following elements identified in the privacy risk assessment: [Assignment:

  Supplemental Guidance:

  Limiting personally identifiable information in audit records when such
  information is not needed for operational purposes helps reduce the level of
  privacy risk created by a system. Related Control(s): RA-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
