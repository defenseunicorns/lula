control-acronym: "[r5] AU-12(03)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Provide and implement the capability for [Assignment: organization-defined
  individuals or roles] to change the logging to be performed on [Assignment:
  organization-defined system components] based on [Assignment:
  organization-defined selectable event criteria] within [Assignment:
  organization-defined time thresholds].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Permitting authorized individuals to make changes to system logging enables
  organizations to extend or limit logging as necessary to meet organizational
  requirements. Logging that is limited to conserve system resources may be
  extended (either temporarily or permanently) to address certain threat
  situations. In addition, logging may be limited to a specific set of event
  types to facilitate audit reduction, analysis, and reporting. Organizations
  can establish time thresholds in which logging actions are changed (e.g., near
  real-time, within minutes, or within hours). Related Control(s): AC-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: AU-12(3).1,
  AU-12(3).2, AU-12(3).3, AU-12(3).4, AU-12(3).5; as well as the following Rev.
  5 security requirements: CCI-003834. The resulting compliance status was set
  to non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no
  locally entered test result/compliance statement: AU-12(3).1, AU-12(3).2,
  AU-12(3).3. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  of the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that
  has not been previously assessed: CCI-003834.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS provides flexible and dynamic
  auditing capabilities through its integrated logging and monitoring solutions
  (Vector, Loki, and Grafana). These solutions enable administrators or
  designated organizational roles to dynamically adjust audit configurations
  based on selectable event criteria, such as user authentication events, access
  violations, administrative changes, or specific system alerts. The
  configurable nature of these tools supports rapid updates to auditing rules
  and criteria, facilitating real-time adaptation to emerging threats or
  organizational requirements. However, explicitly defining and documenting the
  precise selectable event criteria, authorized individuals or roles permitted
  to change auditing configurations, and specific time thresholds for
  implementing these changes remains an organizational responsibility.
  Organizations deploying UDS must clearly establish these criteria within
  internal security policies or audit procedures to fully comply with this
  control.)

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS supports dynamic changes to
  auditing configurations through its integrated logging solutions (Vector,
  Loki, and Grafana), enabling authorized personnel to adjust audit settings
  rapidly in response to selectable event criteria (e.g., security incidents,
  unusual system activity, or compliance requirements). These tools allow for
  real-time or near-real-time modification of audit configurations by designated
  administrative roles defined through centralized identity management
  (Keycloak) and Kubernetes RBAC policies. However, explicitly defining and
  formally documenting specific time thresholds for authorized personnel to
  implement changes to auditing based on selectable event criteria is an
  organizational responsibility.)

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS enables specific authorized
  individuals or roles to dynamically modify auditing configurations through its
  integrated logging and monitoring tools (Vector, Loki, and Grafana).
  Administrative control over audit configuration changes is strictly managed
  via centralized identity management (Keycloak) and Kubernetes Role-Based
  Access Control (RBAC), allowing the organization to explicitly define and
  restrict roles (such as Security Administrators or Audit Managers) authorized
  to modify audit settings in response to defined event criteria. However,
  formally identifying and documenting the specific individuals or roles
  permitted to adjust auditing, as well as defining precise event criteria and
  time thresholds for these adjustments, remains an organizational
  responsibility.)

  UDS provides technical capabilities allowing designated organizational roles
  or individuals to dynamically change auditing configurations on system
  components. Through integrated logging and monitoring solutions (Vector, Loki,
  and Grafana) combined with centralized access control via Keycloak and
  Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), UDS ensures authorized personnel
  can quickly adjust audit settings in response to specific event criteria, such
  as security incidents or compliance events. Administrators can define, modify,
  and enforce auditing rules rapidly through configurable dashboards and
  administrative interfaces, enabling timely responsiveness within
  organization-defined thresholds.

  UDS allows auditing configurations to be dynamically adjusted by authorized
  roles or individuals through its integrated logging and monitoring components
  (Vector, Loki, and Grafana). Administrators can define and enforce access
  permissions via centralized identity management (Keycloak) and Kubernetes
  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), specifying precisely which personnel or
  roles can alter auditing configurations. These authorized personnel can then
  modify audit settings on key components such as Kubernetes clusters, Istio
  Service Mesh, Keycloak identity services, and NeuVector security monitoring
  tools.
