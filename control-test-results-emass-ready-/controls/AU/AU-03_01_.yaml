control-information: >-
  Description:

  Generate audit records containing the following additional information:
  [Assignment: organization-defined additional information].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The ability to add information generated in audit records is dependent on
  system functionality to configure the audit record content. Organizations may
  consider additional information in audit records including, but not limited
  to, access control or flow control rules invoked and individual identities of
  group account users. Organizations may also consider limiting additional audit
  record information to only information that is explicitly needed for audit
  requirements. This facilitates the use of audit trails and audit logs by not
  including information in audit records that could potentially be misleading,
  make it more difficult to locate information of interest, or increase the risk
  to individuals' privacy. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  content of audit records; system security plan; privacy plan; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  list of organization-defined auditable events; system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators; system
  developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: system audit capability].

test-results: UDS can generate additional custom audit records tailored to
  organization defined data requirements. To meet this CCI the organization must
  define any additional audit record requirements before implementation. By
  default UDS does at a minimum provide recording of privileged commands.
