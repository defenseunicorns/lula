control-information: >-
  Description:

  Provide a warning to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel, roles,
  and/or locations] within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when
  allocated audit log storage volume reaches [Assignment: organization-defined
  percentage] of repository maximum audit log storage capacity.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations may have multiple audit log storage repositories distributed
  across multiple system components with each repository having different
  storage volume capacities. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  response to audit processing failures; system design documentation; system
  security plan; privacy system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators; system
  developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing audit storage limit warnings].


  Statement of Weakness:

  The UDS monitoring components (Prometheus/Grafana) keep an eye on system
  health, including the logging pipeline. If the log collector (Vector) or log
  store (Loki) fails or fills up, this would generate alerts (e.g., a Prometheus
  alert if Loki is unreachable or if disk usage for logs is high).
  Administrators would be notified to take action (such as allocate more space
  or restart services). While UDS does not automatically switch to an alternate
  logging mechanism upon failure, it does ensure that failures are detected and
  can be responded to in a timely manner

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.

  UDS warning and notifications are immediate once they are triggered. To meet
  the requirement of providing a warning when allocated audit record storage
  nears capacity, you can configure a threshold-based alert in your monitoring
  stack (e.g., Grafana + Loki) that checks repository utilization and triggers
  once it surpasses an organization-defined percentage. In Grafana, create an
  alert rule that queries storage metrics (or log volume usage) and compares
  them against your defined threshold (e.g., 75% of maximum capacity per DoD
  defined percentage). Then, use notification policies and contact points to
  route the alert to the appropriate personnel, roles, or locations (such as a
  security team’s Mattermost channel or a compliance officer’s email) within the
  specified time period. This ensures the system automatically provides advance
  warning, giving staff adequate time to manage storage capacity and maintain
  audit record integrity.
