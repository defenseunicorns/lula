control-information: >-
  Description:

  Compile audit records from [Assignment: organization-defined system
  components] into a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail that is
  time-correlated to within [Assignment: organization-defined level of tolerance
  for the relationship between time stamps of individual records in the audit
  trail].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit trails are time-correlated if the time stamps in the individual audit
  records can be reliably related to the time stamps in other audit records to
  achieve a time ordering of the records within organizational tolerances.
  Related Control(s): AU-8, SC-45.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; system security plan;
  privacy plan; procedures addressing audit record generation; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system-wide audit trail (logical or physical); system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit record generation
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing audit record generation
  capability].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: AU-12(1).1,
  AU-12(1).2, AU-12(1).3. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally
  entered test result/compliance statement: AU-12(1).1.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS inherently supports precise
  timestamp synchronization and correlation across audit records through Network
  Time Protocol (NTP) synchronization on Kubernetes clusters and associated
  system components, including Vector and Loki for audit logging. These
  components consistently record timestamps accurately, enabling correlation of
  audit events. However, explicitly defining and documenting the acceptable
  level of tolerance (e.g., seconds or milliseconds) between timestamps of
  individual audit records to facilitate accurate event correlation remains an
  organizational procedural responsibility. The organization deploying UDS must
  formally define and document this time tolerance within internal security
  policies or audit procedures to fully comply with this control.)

  UDS compiles comprehensive audit records from all critical information system
  components including Keycloak (identity management), Istio Service Mesh
  (network traffic and policy enforcement), NeuVector (container security),
  Kubernetes (system resource management), and infrastructure components into a
  centralized, unified audit trail. Logs from these components are securely
  collected and aggregated by Vector, centrally stored and indexed in Loki, and
  made searchable through Grafana dashboards. All logs are timestamped and
  synchronized via Network Time Protocol (NTP), ensuring accurate correlation of
  events across the system within very close tolerances. 

  UDS provides comprehensive capabilities to compile audit records from critical
  information system components into a centralized, system-wide audit trail.
  Audit records are systematically collected from key platform components,
  including Keycloak (user authentication and identity management events), Istio
  Service Mesh (network traffic and security policy enforcement events),
  NeuVector (container runtime security events), Kubernetes (cluster resource
  management and operational events), and infrastructure-level events. These
  logs are securely aggregated and centrally stored using Vector and Loki,
  enabling efficient correlation and analysis through Grafana dashboards.
