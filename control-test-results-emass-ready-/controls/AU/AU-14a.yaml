control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Provide and implement the capability for [Assignment: organization-defined
  users or roles] to [Selection (one or more): record; view; hear; log] the
  content of a user session under [Assignment: organization-defined
  circumstances]; and

  b. Develop, integrate, and use session auditing activities in consultation
  with legal counsel and in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders,
  directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Session audits can include monitoring keystrokes, tracking websites visited,
  and recording information and/or file transfers. Session audit capability is
  implemented in addition to event logging and may involve implementation of
  specialized session capture technology. Organizations consider how session
  auditing can reveal information about individuals that may give rise to
  privacy risk as well as how to mitigate those risks. Because session auditing
  can impact system and network performance, organizations activate the
  capability under well-defined situations (e.g., the organization is suspicious
  of a specific individual). Organizations consult with legal counsel, civil
  liberties officials, and privacy officials to ensure that any legal, privacy,
  civil rights, or civil liberties issues, including the use of personally
  identifiable information, are appropriately addressed. Related Control(s):

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  and privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators; system

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: AU-14(2).1,
  AU-14.1; as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-003844,
  CCI-003845, CCI-003846. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally
  entered test result/compliance statement: AU-14.1. The resulting compliance
  status was set to non-compliant because of the addition of a new security
  requirement to the assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed:
  CCI-003844, CCI-003845, CCI-003846.


  The UDS platform provides the capability for authorized users to capture,
  record, and log content related to a user session. This functionality is
  implemented across all components of the UDS platform, including Keycloak,
  Kubernetes, and NeuVector. Authorized users, typically those with privileged
  access, can utilize this capability to ensure that all relevant session
  activities are logged and monitored. Logs generated during user sessions
  capture essential details such as user actions, timestamps, and session
  content. These logs are collected using Vector and aggregated in Loki,
  providing a centralized repository for audit records. Grafana is used to
  visualize and analyze the session logs, offering insights into user activities
  and ensuring comprehensive session auditing.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS does not inherently provide,
  support, or facilitate user session capturing, recording, or playback
  capabilities (e.g., screen captures, audio/video recording, or session
  replays). Such functionality, if required, would need to be implemented
  through external monitoring or audit tools at the client endpoint or
  application level, separate from the core UDS technology stack.)
