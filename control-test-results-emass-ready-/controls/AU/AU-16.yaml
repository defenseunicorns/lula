control-information: >-
  Description:

  Employ [Assignment: organization-defined methods] for coordinating
  [Assignment: organization-defined audit information] among external
  organizations when audit information is transmitted across organizational
  boundaries.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  When organizations use systems or services of external organizations, the
  audit logging capability necessitates a coordinated, cross-organization
  approach. For example, maintaining the identity of individuals who request
  specific services across organizational boundaries may often be difficult, and
  doing so may prove to have significant performance and privacy ramifications.
  Therefore, it is often the case that cross-organizational audit logging simply
  captures the identity of individuals who issue requests at the initial system,
  and subsequent systems record that the requests originated from authorized
  individuals. Organizations consider including processes for coordinating audit
  information requirements and protection of audit information in information
  exchange agreements. Related Control(s): AU-3, AU-6, AU-7, CA-3, PT-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; system security plan;
  privacy plan; procedures addressing methods for coordinating audit information
  among external organizations; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit records;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  coordinating audit information among external organizations; organizational
  personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing cross-organizational auditing].
