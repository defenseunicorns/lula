control-acronym: "[r5] AU-09(04)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Authorize access to management of audit logging functionality to only
  [Assignment: organization-defined subset of privileged users or roles].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Individuals or roles with privileged access to a system and who are also the
  subject of an audit by that system may affect the reliability of the audit
  information by inhibiting audit activities or modifying audit records.
  Requiring privileged access to be further defined between audit-related
  privileges and other privileges limits the number of users or roles with
  audit-related privileges. Related Control(s): AC-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; system security plan;
  privacy plan; access control policy and procedures; procedures addressing
  protection of audit information; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system-generated list of
  privileged users with access to management of audit functionality; access
  authorizations; access control list; system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms managing access to audit functionality].
