control-information: >-
  Description:

  Transfer audit logs [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to a
  different system, system component, or media other than the system or system
  component conducting the logging.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit log transfer, also known as off-loading, is a common process in systems
  with limited audit log storage capacity and thus supports availability of the
  audit logs. The initial audit log storage is only used in a transitory fashion
  until the system can communicate with the secondary or alternate system
  allocated to audit log storage, at which point the audit logs are transferred.
  Transferring audit logs to alternate storage is similar to AU-9(2) in that
  audit logs are transferred to a different entity. However, the purpose of
  selecting AU-9(2) is to protect the confidentiality and integrity of audit
  records. Organizations can select either control enhancement to obtain the
  benefit of increased audit log storage capacity and preserving the
  confidentiality, integrity, and availability of audit records and logs.
  Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; system security plan;
  privacy plan; procedures addressing audit storage capacity; procedures
  addressing transfer of system audit records to secondary or alternate systems;
  system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; logs of audit record transfers to secondary or alternate
  systems; system audit records transferred to secondary or alternate systems;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit storage capacity
  planning responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting the transfer of audit records onto a
  different system].
