control-acronym: "[r5] AU-08"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Use internal system clocks to generate time stamps for audit records; and

  b. Record time stamps for audit records that meet [Assignment:
  organization-defined granularity of time measurement] and that use Coordinated
  Universal Time, have a fixed local time offset from Coordinated Universal
  Time, or that include the local time offset as part of the time stamp.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Time stamps generated by the system include date and time. Time is commonly
  expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of
  Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. Granularity
  of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between system
  clocks and reference clocks (e.g., clocks synchronizing within hundreds of
  milliseconds or tens of milliseconds). Organizations may define different time
  granularities for different system components. Time service can be critical to
  other security capabilities such as access control and identification and
  authentication, depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support
  those capabilities. Related Control(s): AU-3, AU-12, AU-14, SC-45.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; system security plan;
  privacy plan; procedures addressing timestamp generation; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators; system
  developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing timestamp generation].

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.

  UDS meets the DoD requirement to generate time in the time stamps for audit
  records that meets one second granularity of time measurement. 

  All UDS logs (Keycloak, Loki entries, etc.) will carry consistent,
  synchronized timestamps in UTC when configured.
