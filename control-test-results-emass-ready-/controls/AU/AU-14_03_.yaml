control-information: >-
  Description:

  Provide and implement the capability for authorized users to remotely view and
  hear content related to an established user session in real time.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  None. Related Control(s): AC-17.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators; system

  related to an established user session in real time is provided.

  - the capability for authorized users to remotely view and hear content
  related to an established user session in real time is implemented.

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: AU-14(3).1; as
  well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-003848. The resulting
  compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following Rev. 4
  assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance statement:
  AU-14(3).1. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  of the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that
  has not been previously assessed: CCI-003848.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS itself does not inherently
  provide or support remote, real-time viewing or listening to user session
  content (e.g., session mirroring, remote desktop viewing, or real-time session
  monitoring). Such functionality, if required, would typically be provided by
  specialized endpoint monitoring or auditing tools external to the UDS
  environment. Therefore, this control is considered not applicable directly to
  the UDS platform.)
