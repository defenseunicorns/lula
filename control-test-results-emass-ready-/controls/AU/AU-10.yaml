control-acronym: "[r5] AU-10"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Provide irrefutable evidence that an individual (or process acting on behalf
  of an individual) has performed [Assignment: organization-defined actions to
  be covered by non-repudiation].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Types of individual actions covered by non-repudiation include creating
  information, sending and receiving messages, and approving information.
  Non-repudiation protects against claims by authors of not having authored
  certain documents, senders of not having transmitted messages, receivers of
  not having received messages, and signatories of not having signed documents.
  Non-repudiation services can be used to determine if information originated
  from an individual or if an individual took specific actions (e.g., sending an
  email, signing a contract, approving a procurement request, or receiving
  specific information). Organizations obtain non-repudiation services by
  employing various techniques or mechanisms, including digital signatures and
  digital message receipts. Related Control(s): AU-9, PM-12, SA-8, SC-8, SC-12,
  SC-13, SC-16, SC-17, SC-23.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; system security plan;
  privacy plan; procedures addressing non-repudiation; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators; system
  developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing non-repudiation capability].

  UDS provides strong technical mechanisms to protect against false denial
  (non-repudiation) through comprehensive audit logging and identity management
  solutions. Specifically, UDS leverages centralized identity management
  (Keycloak) to reliably authenticate user identities using PKI-based
  credentials (such as CAC/PIV), which provide cryptographically strong proof of
  identity. Detailed audit logs captured via Vector and centrally stored in Loki
  provide immutable, timestamped records of user activities, ensuring
  traceability of critical actions. Additionally, the use of mutual TLS (mTLS)
  within Istio Service Mesh provides cryptographic validation of transactions
  between microservices. 

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.
