  Description:

  a. Provide and implement the capability for [Assignment: organization-defined
  users or roles] to [Selection (one or more): record; view; hear; log] the
  content of a user session under [Assignment: organization-defined
  circumstances]; and

  b. Develop, integrate, and use session auditing activities in consultation
  with legal counsel and in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders,
  directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Session audits can include monitoring keystrokes, tracking websites visited,
  and recording information and/or file transfers. Session audit capability is
  implemented in addition to event logging and may involve implementation of
  specialized session capture technology. Organizations consider how session
  auditing can reveal information about individuals that may give rise to
  privacy risk as well as how to mitigate those risks. Because session auditing
  can impact system and network performance, organizations activate the
  capability under well-defined situations (e.g., the organization is suspicious
  of a specific individual). Organizations consult with legal counsel, civil
  liberties officials, and privacy officials to ensure that any legal, privacy,
  civil rights, or civil liberties issues, including the use of personally
  identifiable information, are appropriately addressed. Related Control(s):

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
