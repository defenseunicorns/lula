control-acronym: "[r5] AU-06"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Review and analyze system audit records [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency] for indications of [Assignment: organization-defined inappropriate
  or unusual activity] and the potential impact of the inappropriate or unusual
  activity;

  b. Report findings to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles];
  and

  c. Adjust the level of audit record review, analysis, and reporting within the
  system when there is a change in risk based on law enforcement information,
  intelligence information, or other credible sources of information.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit record review, analysis, and reporting covers information security- and
  privacy-related logging performed by organizations, including logging that
  results from the monitoring of account usage, remote access, wireless
  connectivity, mobile device connection, configuration settings, system
  component inventory, use of maintenance tools and non-local maintenance,
  physical access, temperature and humidity, equipment delivery and removal,
  communications at system interfaces, and use of mobile code or Voice over
  Internet Protocol (VoIP). Findings can be reported to organizational entities
  that include the incident response team, help desk, and security or privacy
  offices. If organizations are prohibited from reviewing and analyzing audit
  records or unable to conduct such activities, the review or analysis may be
  carried out by other organizations granted such authority. The frequency,
  scope, and/or depth of the audit record review, analysis, and reporting may be
  adjusted to meet organizational needs based on new information received.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; system security plan;
  privacy plan; procedures addressing audit review, analysis, and reporting;
  reports of audit findings; records of actions taken in response to
  reviews/analyses of audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit review, analysis,
  and reporting responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities].
