control-acronym: "[r5] PM-14"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Implement a process for ensuring that organizational plans for conducting
  security and privacy testing, training, and monitoring activities associated
  with organizational systems:

  1. Are developed and maintained; and

  2. Continue to be executed; and

  b. Review testing, training, and monitoring plans for consistency with the
  organizational risk management strategy and organization-wide priorities for
  risk response actions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A process for organization-wide security and privacy testing, training, and
  monitoring helps ensure that organizations provide oversight for testing,
  training, and monitoring activities and that those activities are coordinated.
  With the growing importance of continuous monitoring programs, the
  implementation of information security and privacy across the three levels of
  the risk management hierarchy and the widespread use of common controls,
  organizations coordinate and consolidate the testing and monitoring activities
  that are routinely conducted as part of ongoing assessments supporting a
  variety of controls. Security and privacy training activities, while focused
  on individual systems and specific roles, require coordination across all
  organizational elements. Testing, training, and monitoring plans and
  activities are informed by current threat and vulnerability assessments.
  Related Control(s): AT-2, AT-3, CA-7, CP-4, IR-3, PM-12, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; privacy program
  plan; plans for conducting security and privacy testing, training, and
  monitoring activities; organizational procedures addressing the development
  and maintenance of plans for conducting security and privacy testing,
  training, and monitoring activities; risk management strategy; procedures for
  the review of plans for conducting security and privacy testing, training, and
  monitoring activities for consistency with risk management strategy and risk
  response priorities; results of risk assessments associated with conducting
  security and privacy testing, training, and monitoring activities;
  documentation of the timely execution of plans for conducting security and
  privacy testing, training, and monitoring activities; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  developing and maintaining plans for conducting security and privacy testing,
  training, and monitoring activities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for the development and
  maintenance of plans for conducting security and privacy testing, training,
  and monitoring activities; mechanisms supporting the development and
  maintenance of plans for conducting security and privacy testing, training,
  and monitoring activities].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: PM-14.7, PM-14.8,
  PM-14.9; as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-004359,
  CCI-004360, CCI-004361. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally
  entered test result/compliance statement: PM-14.7, PM-14.8. The resulting
  compliance status was set to non-compliant because of the addition of a new
  security requirement to the assessment procedure that has not been previously
  assessed: CCI-004359, CCI-004360, CCI-004361.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The Program Management (PM) family of
  controls primarily focuses on high-level organizational security governance,
  including policies, risk management strategies, and enterprise-wide planning.
  These controls are typically addressed at the organizational level rather than
  by a specific technology platform like UDS.)

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.
