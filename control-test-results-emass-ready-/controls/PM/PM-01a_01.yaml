control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop and disseminate an organization-wide information security program
  plan that:

  1. Provides an overview of the requirements for the security program and a
  description of the security program management controls and common controls in
  place or planned for meeting those requirements;

  2. Includes the identification and assignment of roles, responsibilities,
  management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and
  compliance;

  3. Reflects the coordination among organizational entities responsible for
  information security; and

  4. Is approved by a senior official with responsibility and accountability for
  the risk being incurred to organizational operations (including mission,
  functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other
  organizations, and the Nation;

  b. Review and update the organization-wide information security program plan
  [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment:
  organization-defined events]; and

  c. Protect the information security program plan from unauthorized disclosure
  and modification.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  An information security program plan is a formal document that provides an
  overview of the security requirements for an organization-wide information
  security program and describes the program management controls and common
  controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements. An information
  security program plan can be represented in a single document or compilations
  of documents. Privacy program plans and supply chain risk management plans are
  addressed separately in PM-18 and SR-2, respectively.


  An information security program plan documents implementation details about
  program management and common controls. The plan provides sufficient
  information about the controls (including specification of parameters for
  assignment and selection operations, explicitly or by reference) to enable
  implementations that are unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plan
  and a determination of the risk to be incurred if the plan is implemented as
  intended. Updates to information security program plans include organizational
  changes and problems identified during plan implementation or control
  assessments.


  Program management controls may be implemented at the organization level or
  the mission or business process level, and are essential for managing the
  organization’s information security program. Program management controls are
  distinct from common, system-specific, and hybrid controls because program
  management controls are independent of any particular system. Together, the
  individual system security plans and the organization-wide information
  security program plan provide complete coverage for the security controls
  employed within the organization.


  Common controls available for inheritance by organizational systems are
  documented in an appendix to the organization’s information security program
  plan unless the controls are included in a separate security plan for a
  system. The organization-wide information security program plan indicates
  which separate security plans contain descriptions of common controls.


  Events that may precipitate an update to the information security program plan
  include, but are not limited to, organization-wide assessment or audit
  findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive
  orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Related
  Control(s): PL-2, PM-18, PM-30, RA-9, SI-12, SR-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; procedures
  addressing program plan development and implementation; procedures addressing
  program plan reviews and updates; procedures addressing coordination of the
  program plan with relevant entities; procedures for program plan approvals;
  records of program plan reviews and updates; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  program planning and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for information security program
  plan development, review, update, and approval; mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing the information security program plan].

  Determine if:

  - the information security program plan provides an overview of the
  requirements for the security program.

  - the information security program plan provides a description of the security
