  Description:

  a. Develop and disseminate an organization-wide privacy program plan that
  provides an overview of the agency’s privacy program, and:

  1. Includes a description of the structure of the privacy program and the
  resources dedicated to the privacy program;

  2. Provides an overview of the requirements for the privacy program and a
  description of the privacy program management controls and common controls in
  place or planned for meeting those requirements;

  3. Includes the role of the senior agency official for privacy and the
  identification and assignment of roles of other privacy officials and staff
  and their responsibilities;

  4. Describes management commitment, compliance, and the strategic goals and
  objectives of the privacy program;

  5. Reflects coordination among organizational entities responsible for the
  different aspects of privacy; and

  6. Is approved by a senior official with responsibility and accountability for
  the privacy risk being incurred to organizational operations (including
  mission, functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets,
  individuals, other organizations, and the Nation; and

  changes in federal privacy laws and policy and organizational changes and
  problems identified during plan implementation or privacy control assessments.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A privacy program plan is a formal document that provides an overview of an
  organization’s privacy program, including a description of the structure of
  the privacy program, the resources dedicated to the privacy program, the role
  of the senior agency official for privacy and other privacy officials and
  staff, the strategic goals and objectives of the privacy program, and the
  program management controls and common controls in place or planned for
  meeting applicable privacy requirements and managing privacy risks. Privacy
  program plans can be represented in single documents or compilations of
  documents.


  The senior agency official for privacy is responsible for designating which
  privacy controls the organization will treat as program management, common,
  system-specific, and hybrid controls. Privacy program plans provide sufficient
  information about the privacy program management and common controls
  (including the specification of parameters and assignment and selection
  operations explicitly or by reference) to enable control implementations that
  are unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and a determination
  of the risk incurred if the plans are implemented as intended.


  Program management controls are generally implemented at the organization
  level and are essential for managing the organization’s privacy program.
  Program management controls are distinct from common, system-specific, and
  hybrid controls because program management controls are independent of any
  particular information system. Together, the privacy plans for individual
  systems and the organization-wide privacy program plan provide complete
  coverage for the privacy controls employed within the organization.


  Common controls are documented in an appendix to the organization’s privacy
  program plan unless the controls are included in a separate privacy plan for a
  system. The organization-wide privacy program plan indicates which separate
  privacy plans contain descriptions of privacy controls. Related Control(s):
  PM-8, PM-9, PM-19.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Privacy program plan; procedures addressing program
  plan development and implementation; procedures addressing program plan
  reviews, updates, and approvals; procedures addressing coordination of the
  program plan with relevant entities; records of program plan reviews, updates,
  and approvals; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with privacy program
  planning and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with privacy responsibilities].
