control-information: >-
  Description:

  Establish, maintain, and update [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]
  an inventory of all systems, applications, and projects that process
  personally identifiable information.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  An inventory of systems, applications, and projects that process personally
  identifiable information supports the mapping of data actions, providing
  individuals with privacy notices, maintaining accurate personally identifiable
  information, and limiting the processing of personally identifiable
  information when such information is not needed for operational purposes.
  Organizations may use this inventory to ensure that systems only process the
  personally identifiable information for authorized purposes and that this
  processing is still relevant and necessary for the purpose specified therein.
  Related Control(s): AC-3, CM-8, CM-12, CM-13, PL-8, PM-22, PT-3, PT-5, SI-12,
  SI-18.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Procedures addressing system inventory development,
  maintenance, and updates; OMB FISMA reporting guidance; privacy program plan;
  information security program plan; personally identifiable information
  processing policy; system inventory; personally identifiable information
  inventory; data mapping documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with privacy program
  planning and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational personnel
  responsible for developing and maintaining the system inventory;
  organizational personnel with information security and privacy
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for system inventory development,
  maintenance, and updates; mechanisms supporting the system inventory].

  Determine if:

  - an inventory of all systems, applications, and projects that process
  personally identifiable information is established.

  - an inventory of all systems, applications, and projects that process
  personally identifiable information is maintained.

  - an inventory of all systems, applications, and projects that process
  personally identifiable information is updated [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].
