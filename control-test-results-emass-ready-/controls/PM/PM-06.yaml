control-acronym: "[r5] PM-06"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Develop, monitor, and report on the results of information security and
  privacy measures of performance.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Measures of performance are outcome-based metrics used by an organization to
  measure the effectiveness or efficiency of the information security and
  privacy programs and the controls employed in support of the program. To
  facilitate security and privacy risk management, organizations consider
  aligning measures of performance with the organizational risk tolerance as
  defined in the risk management strategy. Related Control(s): CA-7, PM-9.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; privacy program
  plan; information security measures of performance; privacy measures of
  performance; procedures addressing the development, monitoring, and reporting
  of information security and privacy measures of performance; risk management
  strategy; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy program planning and plan implementation responsibilities;
  organizational personnel responsible for developing, monitoring, and reporting
  information security and privacy measures of performance; organizational
  personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for developing, monitoring, and
  reporting information security and privacy measures of performance; mechanisms
  supporting the development, monitoring, and reporting of information security
  and privacy measures of performance].

  Determine if:
  - information security measures of performance are developed.
  - information security measures of performance are monitored.
  - the results of information security measures of performance are reported.
  - privacy measures of performance are developed.
  - privacy measures of performance are monitored.
  - the results of privacy measures of performance are reported.

test-results: >-
  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: PM-6.1, PM-6.2,
  PM-6.3; as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-004335,
  CCI-004336, CCI-004337. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally
  entered test result/compliance statement: PM-6.3. The resulting compliance
  status was set to non-compliant because of the addition of a new security
  requirement to the assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed:
  CCI-004335, CCI-004336, CCI-004337.


  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The Program Management (PM) family of
  controls primarily focuses on high-level organizational security governance,
  including policies, risk management strategies, and enterprise-wide planning.
  These controls are typically addressed at the organizational level rather than
  by a specific technology platform like UDS.)
