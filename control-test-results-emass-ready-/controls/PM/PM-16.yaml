control-acronym: "[r5] PM-16"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Implement a threat awareness program that includes a cross-organization
  information-sharing capability for threat intelligence.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Because of the constantly changing and increasing sophistication of
  adversaries, especially the advanced persistent threat (APT), it may be more
  likely that adversaries can successfully breach or compromise organizational
  systems. One of the best techniques to address this concern is for
  organizations to share threat information, including threat events (i.e.,
  tactics, techniques, and procedures) that organizations have experienced,
  mitigations that organizations have found are effective against certain types
  of threats, and threat intelligence (i.e., indications and warnings about
  threats). Threat information sharing may be bilateral or multilateral.
  Bilateral threat sharing includes government-to-commercial and
  government-to-government cooperatives. Multilateral threat sharing includes
  organizations taking part in threat-sharing consortia. Threat information may
  require special agreements and protection, or it may be freely shared. Related
  Control(s): IR-4, PM-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; privacy program
  plan; threat awareness program policy; threat awareness program procedures;
  risk assessment results relevant to threat awareness; documentation about the
  cross-organization information-sharing capability; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy program planning and plan implementation responsibilities;
  organizational personnel responsible for the threat awareness program;
  organizational personnel responsible for the cross-organization
  information-sharing capability; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities; external personnel with whom threat
  awareness information is shared by the organization].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for implementing the threat
  awareness program; organizational processes for implementing the
  cross-organization information-sharing capability; mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing the threat awareness program; mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing the cross-organization information-sharing capability].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: PM-16.1. The
  resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following
  Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance
  statement: PM-16.1.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The Program Management (PM) family of
  controls primarily focuses on high-level organizational security governance,
  including policies, risk management strategies, and enterprise-wide planning.
  These controls are typically addressed at the organizational level rather than
  by a specific technology platform like UDS.)
