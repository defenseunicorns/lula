control-information: >-
  Description:

  Establish a security and privacy workforce development and improvement
  program.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Security and privacy workforce development and improvement programs include
  defining the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to perform security and
  privacy duties and tasks; developing role-based training programs for
  individuals assigned security and privacy roles and responsibilities; and
  providing standards and guidelines for measuring and building individual
  qualifications for incumbents and applicants for security- and privacy-related
  positions. Such workforce development and improvement programs can also
  include security and privacy career paths to encourage security and privacy
  professionals to advance in the field and fill positions with greater
  responsibility. The programs encourage organizations to fill security- and
  privacy-related positions with qualified personnel. Security and privacy
  workforce development and improvement programs are complementary to
  organizational security awareness and training programs and focus on
  developing and institutionalizing the core security and privacy capabilities
  of personnel needed to protect organizational operations, assets, and
  individuals. Related Control(s): AT-2, AT-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; privacy program
  plan; information security and privacy workforce development and improvement
  program documentation; procedures for the information security and privacy
  workforce development and improvement program; information security and
  privacy role-based training program documentation; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy program planning and plan implementation responsibilities;
  organizational personnel responsible for the information security and privacy
  workforce development and improvement program; organizational personnel with
  information security and privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for implementing the information
  security and privacy workforce development and improvement program; mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing the information security and privacy workforce
  development and improvement program].
