control-information: >-
  Description:

  Develop and maintain an enterprise architecture with consideration for
  information security, privacy, and the resulting risk to organizational
  operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The integration of security and privacy requirements and controls into the
  enterprise architecture helps to ensure that security and privacy
  considerations are addressed throughout the system development life cycle and
  are explicitly related to the organization’s mission and business processes.
  The process of security and privacy requirements integration also embeds into
  the enterprise architecture and the organization’s security and privacy
  architectures consistent with the organizational risk management strategy. For
  PM-7, security and privacy architectures are developed at a system-of-systems
  level, representing all organizational systems. For PL-8, the security and
  privacy architectures are developed at a level that represents an individual
  system. The system-level architectures are consistent with the security and
  privacy architectures defined for the organization. Security and privacy
  requirements and control integration are most effectively accomplished through
  the rigorous application of the Risk Management Framework SP 800-37 and
  supporting security standards and guidelines. Related Control(s): AU-6, PL-2,
  PL-8, PM-11, RA-2, SA-3, SA-8, SA-17.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; privacy program
  plan; enterprise architecture documentation; procedures addressing enterprise
  architecture development; results of risk assessments of enterprise
  architecture; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy program planning and plan implementation responsibilities;
  organizational personnel responsible for developing enterprise architecture;
  organizational personnel responsible for risk assessments of enterprise
  architecture; organizational personnel with information security and privacy
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for enterprise architecture
  development; mechanisms supporting the enterprise architecture and its
  development].
