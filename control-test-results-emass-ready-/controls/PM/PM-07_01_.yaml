control-information: >-
  Description:

  Offload [Assignment: organization-defined non-essential functions or services]
  to other systems, system components, or an external provider.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Not every function or service that a system provides is essential to
  organizational mission or business functions. Printing or copying is an
  example of a non-essential but supporting service for an organization.
  Whenever feasible, such supportive but non-essential functions or services are
  not co-located with the functions or services that support essential mission
  or business functions. Maintaining such functions on the same system or system
  component increases the attack surface of the organizationâ€™s mission-essential
  functions or services. Moving supportive but non-essential functions to a
  non-critical system, system component, or external provider can also increase
  efficiency by putting those functions or services under the control of
  individuals or providers who are subject matter experts in the functions or
  services. Related Control(s): SA-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; privacy program
  plan; enterprise architecture documentation; procedures addressing enterprise
  architecture development; procedures for identifying and offloading functions
  or services; results of risk assessments of enterprise architecture; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy program planning and plan implementation responsibilities;
  organizational personnel responsible for developing enterprise architecture;
  organizational personnel responsible for risk assessments of enterprise
  architecture; organizational personnel with information security and privacy
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for enterprise architecture
  development; mechanisms supporting the enterprise architecture and its
  development; mechanisms for offloading functions and services].
