control-acronym: "[r5] PM-08"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Address information security and privacy issues in the development,
  documentation, and updating of a critical infrastructure and key resources
  protection plan.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Protection strategies are based on the prioritization of critical assets and
  resources. The requirement and guidance for defining critical infrastructure
  and key resources and for preparing an associated critical infrastructure
  protection plan are found in applicable laws, executive orders, directives,
  policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Related Control(s): CP-2,
  CP-4, PE-18, PL-2, PM-9, PM-11, PM-18, RA-3, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; privacy program
  plan; critical infrastructure and key resources protection plan; procedures
  addressing the development, documentation, and updating of the critical
  infrastructure and key resources protection plan; HSPD 7; National
  Infrastructure Protection Plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy program planning and plan implementation responsibilities;
  organizational personnel responsible for developing, documenting, and updating
  the critical infrastructure and key resources protection plan; organizational
  personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for developing, documenting, and
  updating the critical infrastructure and key resources protection plan;
  mechanisms supporting the development, documentation, and updating of the
  critical infrastructure and key resources protection plan].
