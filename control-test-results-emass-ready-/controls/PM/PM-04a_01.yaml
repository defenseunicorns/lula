control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Implement a process to ensure that plans of action and milestones for the
  information security, privacy, and supply chain risk management programs and
  associated organizational systems:

  1. Are developed and maintained;

  2. Document the remedial information security, privacy, and supply chain risk
  management actions to adequately respond to risk to organizational operations
  and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation; and

  3. Are reported in accordance with established reporting requirements.

  b. Review plans of action and milestones for consistency with the
  organizational risk management strategy and organization-wide priorities for
  risk response actions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The plan of action and milestones is a key organizational document and is
  subject to reporting requirements established by the Office of Management and
  Budget. Organizations develop plans of action and milestones with an
  organization-wide perspective, prioritizing risk response actions and ensuring
  consistency with the goals and objectives of the organization. Plan of action
  and milestones updates are based on findings from control assessments and
  continuous monitoring activities. There can be multiple plans of action and
  milestones corresponding to the information system level, mission/business
  process level, and organizational/governance level. While plans of action and
  milestones are required for federal organizations, other types of
  organizations can help reduce risk by documenting and tracking planned
  remediations. Specific guidance on plans of action and milestones at the
  system level is provided in CA-5. Related Control(s): CA-5, CA-7, PM-3, RA-7,
  SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; plans of action and
  milestones; procedures addressing plans of action and milestones development
  and maintenance; procedures addressing plans of action and milestones
  reporting; procedures for reviewing plans of action and milestones for
  consistency with risk management strategy and risk response priorities;
  results of risk assessments associated with plans of action and milestones;
  OMB FISMA reporting requirements; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  developing, maintaining, reviewing, and reporting plans of action and
  milestones; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for plan of action and milestones
  development, review, maintenance, and reporting; mechanisms supporting plans
  of action and milestones].
