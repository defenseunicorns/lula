control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Include the resources needed to implement the information security and
  privacy programs in capital planning and investment requests and document all
  exceptions to this requirement;

  b. Prepare documentation required for addressing information security and
  privacy programs in capital planning and investment requests in accordance
  with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations,
  standards; and

  c. Make available for expenditure, the planned information security and
  privacy resources.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations consider establishing champions for information security and
  privacy and, as part of including the necessary resources, assign specialized
  expertise and resources as needed. Organizations may designate and empower an
  Investment Review Board or similar group to manage and provide oversight for
  the information security and privacy aspects of the capital planning and
  investment control process. Related Control(s): PM-4, SA-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: PM-3.2; as well as
  the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-004316, CCI-004317. The
  resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following
  Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance
  statement: PM-3.2. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant
  because of the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment
  procedure that has not been previously assessed: CCI-004316, CCI-004317.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The Program Management (PM) family of
  controls primarily focuses on high-level organizational security governance,
  including policies, risk management strategies, and enterprise-wide planning.
  These controls are typically addressed at the organizational level rather than
  by a specific technology platform like UDS.)
