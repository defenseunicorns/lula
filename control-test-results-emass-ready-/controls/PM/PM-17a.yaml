  Description:

  a. Establish policy and procedures to ensure that requirements for the
  protection of controlled unclassified information that is processed, stored or
  transmitted on external systems, are implemented in accordance with applicable
  laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards; and

  b. Review and update the policy and procedures [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Controlled unclassified information is defined by the National Archives and
  Records Administration along with the safeguarding and dissemination
  requirements for such information and is codified in 32 CFR 2002 and,
  specifically for systems external to the federal organization, 32 CFR
  2002.14h. The policy prescribes the specific use and conditions to be
  implemented in accordance with organizational procedures, including via its
  contracting processes. Related Control(s): CA-6, PM-10.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Controlled unclassified information policy; controlled
  unclassified information procedures; other relevant documents or records.].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with controlled unclassified
  information responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities.].
