control-acronym: "[r5] PM-10"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Manage the security and privacy state of organizational systems and the
  environments in which those systems operate through authorization processes;

  b. Designate individuals to fulfill specific roles and responsibilities within
  the organizational risk management process; and

  c. Integrate the authorization processes into an organization-wide risk
  management program.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Authorization processes for organizational systems and environments of
  operation require the implementation of an organization-wide risk management
  process and associated security and privacy standards and guidelines. Specific
  roles for risk management processes include a risk executive (function) and
  designated authorizing officials for each organizational system and common
  control provider. The authorization processes for the organization are
  integrated with continuous monitoring processes to facilitate ongoing
  understanding and acceptance of security and privacy risks to organizational
  operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the
  Nation. Related Control(s): CA-6, CA-7, PL-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; privacy program
  plan; procedures addressing management (i.e., documentation, tracking, and
  reporting) of the authorization process; assessment, authorization, and
  monitoring policy; assessment, authorization, and monitoring procedures;
  system authorization documentation; lists or other documentation about
  authorization process roles and responsibilities; risk assessment results
  relevant to the authorization process and the organization-wide risk
  management program; organizational risk management strategy; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy program planning and plan implementation responsibilities;
  organizational personnel responsible for management of the authorization
  process; organizational personnel with information security and privacy
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for authorization; mechanisms
  supporting the authorization process].
