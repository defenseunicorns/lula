  Description:

  Identify, prioritize, and assess suppliers of critical or mission-essential
  technologies, products, and services.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The identification and prioritization of suppliers of critical or
  mission-essential technologies, products, and services is paramount to the
  mission/business success of organizations. The assessment of suppliers is
  conducted using supplier reviews (see SR-6) and supply chain risk assessment
  processes (see RA-3(1)). An analysis of supply chain risk can help an
  organization identify systems or components for which additional supply chain
  risk mitigations are required. Related Control(s): RA-3, SR-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Supply chain risk management strategy;
  organization-wide risk management strategy; enterprise risk management
  documents; inventory records or suppliers; assessment and prioritization
  documentation; critical or mission-essential technologies, products, and
  service documents or records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with supply chain risk
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with acquisition
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with enterprise risk management
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for identifying, prioritizing,
  and assessing critical or mission-essential technologies, products, and
  services; organizational processes for maintaining an inventory of suppliers;
  organizational process for associating suppliers with critical or
  mission-essential technologies, products, and services].
