  Description:

  Develop and post privacy policies on all external-facing websites, mobile
  applications, and other digital services, that:

  (a) Are written in plain language and organized in a way that is easy to
  understand and navigate;

  (b) Provide information needed by the public to make an informed decision
  about whether and how to interact with the organization; and

  (c) Are updated whenever the organization makes a substantive change to the
  practices it describes and includes a time/date stamp to inform the public of
  the date of the most recent changes.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations post privacy policies on all external-facing websites, mobile
  applications, and other digital services. Organizations post a link to the
  relevant privacy policy on any known, major entry points to the website,
  application, or digital service. In addition, organizations provide a link to
  the privacy policy on any webpage that collects personally identifiable
  information. Organizations may be subject to applicable laws, executive
  orders, directives, regulations, or policies that require the provision of
  specific information to the public. Organizational personnel consult with the
  senior agency official for privacy and legal counsel regarding such
  requirements. Related Control(s): None.
