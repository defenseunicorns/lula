control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop [Assignment: organization-defined privacy reports] and disseminate
  to:

  1. [Assignment: organization-defined oversight bodies] to demonstrate
  accountability with statutory, regulatory, and policy privacy mandates; and

  2. [Assignment: organization-defined officials] and other personnel with
  responsibility for monitoring privacy program compliance; and

  b. Review and update privacy reports [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Through internal and external reporting, organizations promote accountability
  and transparency in organizational privacy operations. Reporting can also help
  organizations to determine progress in meeting privacy compliance requirements
  and privacy controls, compare performance across the federal government,
  discover vulnerabilities, identify gaps in policy and implementation, and
  identify models for success. For federal agencies, privacy reports include
  annual senior agency official for privacy reports to OMB, reports to Congress
  required by Implementing Regulations of the 9/11 Commission Act, and other
  public reports required by law, regulation, or policy, including internal
  policies of organizations. The senior agency official for privacy consults
  with legal counsel, where appropriate, to ensure that organizations meet all
  applicable privacy reporting requirements. Related Control(s): IR-9, PM-19.
