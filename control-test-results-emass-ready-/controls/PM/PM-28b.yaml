control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Identify and document:

  1. Assumptions affecting risk assessments, risk responses, and risk
  monitoring;

  2. Constraints affecting risk assessments, risk responses, and risk
  monitoring;

  3. Priorities and trade-offs considered by the organization for managing risk;
  and

  4. Organizational risk tolerance;

  b. Distribute the results of risk framing activities to [Assignment:
  organization-defined personnel]; and

  c. Review and update risk framing considerations [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Risk framing is most effective when conducted at the organization level and in
  consultation with stakeholders throughout the organization including mission,
  business, and system owners. The assumptions, constraints, risk tolerance,
  priorities, and trade-offs identified as part of the risk framing process
  inform the risk management strategy, which in turn informs the conduct of risk
  assessment, risk response, and risk monitoring activities. Risk framing
  results are shared with organizational personnel, including mission and
  business owners, information owners or stewards, system owners, authorizing
  officials, senior agency information security officer, senior agency official
  for privacy, and senior accountable official for risk management. Related
  Control(s): CA-7, PM-9, RA-3, RA-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; privacy program
  plan; supply chain risk management strategy; documentation of risk framing
  activities; policies and procedures for risk framing activities; risk
  management strategy].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel (including mission,
  business, and system owners or stewards; authorizing officials; senior agency
  information security officer; senior agency official for privacy; and senior
  accountable official for risk management)].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational procedures and practices for authorizing,
  conducting, managing, and reviewing personally identifiable information
  processing; organizational processes for risk framing; mechanisms supporting
  the development, review, update, and approval of risk framing].
