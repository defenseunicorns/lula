  Description:

  Establish a Data Integrity Board to:

  a. Review proposals to conduct or participate in a matching program; and

  b. Conduct an annual review of all matching programs in which the agency has
  participated.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A Data Integrity Board is the board of senior officials designated by the head
  of a federal agency and is responsible for, among other things, reviewing the
  agencyâ€™s proposals to conduct or participate in a matching program and
  conducting an annual review of all matching programs in which the agency has
  participated. As a general matter, a matching program is a computerized
  comparison of records from two or more automated PRIVACT systems of records or
  an automated system of records and automated records maintained by a
  non-federal agency (or agent thereof). A matching program either pertains to
  Federal benefit programs or Federal personnel or payroll records. At a
  minimum, the Data Integrity Board includes the Inspector General of the
  agency, if any, and the senior agency official for privacy. Related

  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
