control-acronym: "[r5] PM-09"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develops a comprehensive strategy to manage:

  1. Security risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
  organizations, and the Nation associated with the operation and use of
  organizational systems; and

  2. Privacy risk to individuals resulting from the authorized processing of
  personally identifiable information;

  b. Implement the risk management strategy consistently across the
  organization; and

  c. Review and update the risk management strategy [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] or as required, to address organizational
  changes.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  An organization-wide risk management strategy includes an expression of the
  security and privacy risk tolerance for the organization, security and privacy
  risk mitigation strategies, acceptable risk assessment methodologies, a
  process for evaluating security and privacy risk across the organization with
  respect to the organizationâ€™s risk tolerance, and approaches for monitoring
  risk over time. The senior accountable official for risk management (agency
  head or designated official) aligns information security management processes
  with strategic, operational, and budgetary planning processes. The risk
  executive function, led by the senior accountable official for risk
  management, can facilitate consistent application of the risk management
  strategy organization-wide. The risk management strategy can be informed by
  security and privacy risk-related inputs from other sources, both internal and
  external to the organization, to ensure that the strategy is broad-based and
  comprehensive. The supply chain risk management strategy described in PM-30
  can also provide useful inputs to the organization-wide risk management
  strategy. Related Control(s): AC-1, AU-1, AT-1, CA-1, CA-2, CA-5, CA-6, CA-7,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; privacy program
  plan; risk management strategy; supply chain risk management strategy;
  procedures addressing the development, implementation, review, and update of
  the risk management strategy; risk assessment results relevant to the risk
  management strategy; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy program planning and plan implementation responsibilities;
  organizational personnel responsible for the development, implementation,
  review, and update of the risk management strategy; organizational personnel
  with information security and privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for the development,
  implementation, review, and update of the risk management strategy; mechanisms
  supporting the development, implementation, review, and update of the risk
  management strategy].
