control-acronym: "[r5] PM-16(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Employ automated mechanisms to maximize the effectiveness of sharing threat
  intelligence information.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  To maximize the effectiveness of monitoring, it is important to know what
  threat observables and indicators the sensors need to be searching for. By
  using well-established frameworks, services, and automated tools,
  organizations improve their ability to rapidly share and feed the relevant
  threat detection signatures into monitoring tools. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; privacy program
  plan; threat awareness program policy; threat awareness program procedures;
  risk assessment results related to threat awareness; documentation about the
  cross-organization information-sharing capability; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy program planning and plan implementation responsibilities;
  organizational personnel responsible for the threat awareness program;
  organizational personnel responsible for the cross-organization
  information-sharing capability; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities; external personnel with whom threat
  awareness information is shared by the organization].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for implementing the threat
  awareness program; organizational processes for implementing the
  cross-organization information-sharing capability; automated mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing the threat awareness program; automated
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the cross-organization
  information-sharing capability].
