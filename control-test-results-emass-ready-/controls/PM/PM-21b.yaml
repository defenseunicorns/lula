control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop and maintain an accurate accounting of disclosures of personally
  identifiable information, including:

  1. Date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure; and

  2. Name and address, or other contact information of the individual or
  organization to which the disclosure was made;

  b. Retain the accounting of disclosures for the length of the time the
  personally identifiable information is maintained or five years after the
  disclosure is made, whichever is longer; and

  c. Make the accounting of disclosures available to the individual to whom the
  personally identifiable information relates upon request.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The purpose of accounting of disclosures is to allow individuals to learn to
  whom their personally identifiable information has been disclosed, to provide
  a basis for subsequently advising recipients of any corrected or disputed
  personally identifiable information, and to provide an audit trail for
  subsequent reviews of organizational compliance with conditions for
  disclosures. For federal agencies, keeping an accounting of disclosures is
  required by the PRIVACT; agencies should consult with their senior agency
  official for privacy and legal counsel on this requirement and be aware of the
  statutory exceptions and OMB guidance relating to the provision.


  Organizations can use any system for keeping notations of disclosures, if it
  can construct from such a system, a document listing of all disclosures along
  with the required information. Automated mechanisms can be used by
  organizations to determine when personally identifiable information is
  disclosed, including commercial services that provide notifications and
  alerts. Accounting of disclosures may also be used to help organizations
  verify compliance with applicable privacy statutes and policies governing the
  disclosure or dissemination of information and dissemination restrictions.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Privacy program plan; disclosure policies and
  procedures; records of disclosures; audit logs; Privacy Act policies and
  procedures; system of records notice; Privacy Act exemption rules.].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with privacy program
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with privacy responsibilities.].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for disclosures; mechanisms
  supporting the accounting of disclosures, including commercial services that
  provide notifications and alerts.].
