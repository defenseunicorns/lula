  Description:

  Develop and document organization-wide policies and procedures for:

  a. Reviewing for the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness of
  personally identifiable information across the information life cycle;

  b. Correcting or deleting inaccurate or outdated personally identifiable
  information;

  c. Disseminating notice of corrected or deleted personally identifiable
  information to individuals or other appropriate entities; and

  d. Appeals of adverse decisions on correction or deletion requests.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Personally identifiable information quality management includes steps that
  organizations take to confirm the accuracy and relevance of personally
  identifiable information throughout the information life cycle. The
  information life cycle includes the creation, collection, use, processing,
  storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, and disposition of personally
  identifiable information. Organizational policies and procedures for
  personally identifiable information quality management are important because
  inaccurate or outdated personally identifiable information maintained by
  organizations may cause problems for individuals. Organizations consider the
  quality of personally identifiable information involved in business functions
  where inaccurate information may result in adverse decisions or the denial of
  benefits and services, or the disclosure of the information may cause
  stigmatization. Correct information, in certain circumstances, can cause
  problems for individuals that outweigh the benefits of organizations
  maintaining the information. Organizations consider creating policies and
  procedures for the removal of such information.


  The senior agency official for privacy ensures that practical means and
  mechanisms exist and are accessible for individuals or their authorized
  representatives to seek the correction or deletion of personally identifiable
  information. Processes for correcting or deleting data are clearly defined and
  publicly available. Organizations use discretion in determining whether data
  is to be deleted or corrected based on the scope of requests, the changes
  sought, and the impact of the changes. Additionally, processes include the
  provision of responses to individuals of decisions to deny requests for
  correction or deletion. The responses include the reasons for the decisions, a
  means to record individual objections to the decisions, and a means of
  requesting reviews of the initial determinations.


  Organizations notify individuals or their designated representatives when
  their personally identifiable information is corrected or deleted to provide
  transparency and confirm the completed action. Due to the complexity of data
  flows and storage, other entities may need to be informed of the correction or
  deletion. Notice supports the consistent correction and deletion of personally
  identifiable information across the data ecosystem. Related Control(s): PM-23,
  SI-18.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Privacy program plan; policies and procedures
  addressing personally identifiable information quality management, information
  life cycle documentation, and sample notices of correction or deletion;
  records of monitoring PII quality management practices; documentation of
  reviews and updates of policies and procedures].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with privacy program
  information dissemination responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: [Organizational processes for data quality and personally
  identifiable information quality management procedures; mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing quality management requirements].
