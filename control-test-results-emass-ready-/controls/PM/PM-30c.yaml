control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop an organization-wide strategy for managing supply chain risks
  associated with the development, acquisition, maintenance, and disposal of
  systems, system components, and system services;

  b. Implement the supply chain risk management strategy consistently across the
  organization; and

  c. Review and update the supply chain risk management strategy on [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] or as required, to address organizational
  changes.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  An organization-wide supply chain risk management strategy includes an
  unambiguous expression of the supply chain risk appetite and tolerance for the
  organization, acceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls,
  a process for consistently evaluating and monitoring supply chain risk,
  approaches for implementing and communicating the supply chain risk management
  strategy, and the associated roles and responsibilities. Supply chain risk
  management includes considerations of the security and privacy risks
  associated with the development, acquisition, maintenance, and disposal of
  systems, system components, and system services. The supply chain risk
  management strategy can be incorporated into the organizationâ€™s overarching
  risk management strategy and can guide and inform supply chain policies and
  system-level supply chain risk management plans. In addition, the use of a
  risk executive function can facilitate a consistent, organization-wide
  application of the supply chain risk management strategy. The supply chain
  risk management strategy is implemented at the organization and
  mission/business levels, whereas the supply chain risk management plan (see
  SR-2) is implemented at the system level. Related Control(s): CM-10, PM-9,
  SR-1, SR-2, SR-3, SR-4, SR-5, SR-6, SR-7, SR-8, SR-9, SR-11.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Supply chain risk management strategy; organizational
  risk management strategy; enterprise risk management documents; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with supply chain risk
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with acquisition
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with enterprise risk management
  responsibilities].
