control-acronym: "[r5] PM-31"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Develop an organization-wide continuous monitoring strategy and implement
  continuous monitoring programs that include:

  a. Establishing the following organization-wide metrics to be monitored:
  [Assignment: organization-defined metrics];

  b. Establishing [Assignment: organization-defined frequencies] for monitoring
  and [Assignment: organization-defined frequencies] for assessment of control
  effectiveness;

  c. Ongoing monitoring of organizationally-defined metrics in accordance with
  the continuous monitoring strategy;

  d. Correlation and analysis of information generated by control assessments
  and monitoring;

  e. Response actions to address results of the analysis of control assessment
  and monitoring information; and

  f. Reporting the security and privacy status of organizational systems to
  [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Continuous monitoring at the organization level facilitates ongoing awareness
  of the security and privacy posture across the organization to support
  organizational risk management decisions. The terms continuous and ongoing
  imply that organizations assess and monitor their controls and risks at a
  frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions. Different types of
  controls may require different monitoring frequencies. The results of
  continuous monitoring guide and inform risk response actions by organizations.
  Continuous monitoring programs allow organizations to maintain the
  authorizations of systems and common controls in highly dynamic environments
  of operation with changing mission and business needs, threats,
  vulnerabilities, and technologies. Having access to security- and
  privacy-related information on a continuing basis through reports and
  dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to make effective,
  timely, and informed risk management decisions, including ongoing
  authorization decisions. To further facilitate security and privacy risk
  management, organizations consider aligning organization-defined monitoring
  metrics with organizational risk tolerance as defined in the risk management
  strategy. Monitoring requirements, including the need for monitoring, may be
  referenced in other controls and control enhancements such as, AC-2g, AC-2(7),

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
