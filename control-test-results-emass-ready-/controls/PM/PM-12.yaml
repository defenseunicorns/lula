  Description:

  Implement an insider threat program that includes a cross-discipline insider
  threat incident handling team.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations that handle classified information are required, under Executive
  Order 13587 EO 13587 and the National Insider Threat Policy ODNI NITP, to
  establish insider threat programs. The same standards and guidelines that
  apply to insider threat programs in classified environments can also be
  employed effectively to improve the security of controlled unclassified and
  other information in non-national security systems. Insider threat programs
  include controls to detect and prevent malicious insider activity through the
  centralized integration and analysis of both technical and nontechnical
  information to identify potential insider threat concerns. A senior official
  is designated by the department or agency head as the responsible individual
  to implement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the
  centralized integration and analysis capability, insider threat programs
  require organizations to prepare department or agency insider threat policies
  and implementation plans, conduct host-based user monitoring of individual
  employee activities on government-owned classified computers, provide insider
  threat awareness training to employees, receive access to information from
  offices in the department or agency for insider threat analysis, and conduct
  self-assessments of department or agency insider threat posture.


  Insider threat programs can leverage the existence of incident handling teams
  that organizations may already have in place, such as computer security
  incident response teams. Human resources records are especially important in
  this effort, as there is compelling evidence to show that some types of
  insider crimes are often preceded by nontechnical behaviors in the workplace,
  including ongoing patterns of disgruntled behavior and conflicts with
  coworkers and other colleagues. These precursors can guide organizational
  officials in more focused, targeted monitoring efforts. However, the use of
  human resource records could raise significant concerns for privacy. The
  participation of a legal team, including consultation with the senior agency
  official for privacy, ensures that monitoring activities are performed in
  accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations,
  policies, standards, and guidelines. Related Control(s): AC-6, AT-2, AU-6,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy program planning and plan implementation responsibilities;
  organizational personnel responsible for the insider threat program; members
  of the cross-discipline insider threat incident handling team; legal counsel;
  organizational personnel with information security and privacy
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for implementing the insider
  threat program and the cross-discipline insider threat incident handling team;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the insider threat program and the
  cross-discipline insider threat incident handling team].
