control-acronym: "[r5] PM-25"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop, document, and implement policies and procedures that address the
  use of personally identifiable information for internal testing, training, and
  research;

  b. Limit or minimize the amount of personally identifiable information used
  for internal testing, training, and research purposes;

  c. Authorize the use of personally identifiable information when such
  information is required for internal testing, training, and research; and

  d. Review and update policies and procedures [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The use of personally identifiable information in testing, research, and
  training increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure or misuse of such
  information. Organizations consult with the senior agency official for privacy
  and/or legal counsel to ensure that the use of personally identifiable
  information in testing, training, and research is compatible with the original
  purpose for which it was collected. When possible, organizations use
  placeholder data to avoid exposure of personally identifiable information when
  conducting testing, training, and research. Related Control(s): PM-23, PT-3,
  SA-3, SA-8, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Privacy program plan; policies and procedures for the
  minimization of personally identifiable information used in testing, training,
  and research; documentation supporting policy implementation (e.g., templates
  for testing, training, and research; privacy threshold analysis; privacy risk
  assessment); data sets used for testing, training, and research].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with privacy program
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with privacy responsibilities;
  system developers; personnel with IRB responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for data quality and personally
  identifiable information management; mechanisms supporting data quality
  management and personally identifiable information management to minimize the
  use of personally identifiable information].
