  Description:

  a. Define organizational mission and business processes with consideration for
  information security and privacy and the resulting risk to organizational
  operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the
  Nation; and

  b. Determine information protection and personally identifiable information
  processing needs arising from the defined mission and business processes; and

  c. Review and revise the mission and business processes [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Protection needs are technology-independent capabilities that are required to
  counter threats to organizations, individuals, systems, and the Nation through
  the compromise of information (i.e., loss of confidentiality, integrity,
  availability, or privacy). Information protection and personally identifiable
  information processing needs are derived from the mission and business needs
  defined by organizational stakeholders, the mission and business processes
  designed to meet those needs, and the organizational risk management strategy.
  Information protection and personally identifiable information processing
  needs determine the required controls for the organization and the systems.
  Inherent to defining protection and personally identifiable information
  processing needs is an understanding of the adverse impact that could result
  if a compromise or breach of information occurs. The categorization process is
  used to make such potential impact determinations. Privacy risks to
  individuals can arise from the compromise of personally identifiable
  information, but they can also arise as unintended consequences or a byproduct
  of the processing of personally identifiable information at any stage of the
  information life cycle. Privacy risk assessments are used to prioritize the
  risks that are created for individuals from system processing of personally
  identifiable information. These risk assessments enable the selection of the
  required privacy controls for the organization and systems. Mission and
  business process definitions and the associated protection requirements are
  documented in accordance with organizational policies and procedures. Related

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; privacy program
  plan; risk management strategy; procedures for determining mission and
  business protection needs; information security and privacy risk assessment
  results relevant to the determination of mission and business protection
  needs; personally identifiable information processing policy; personally
  identifiable information inventory; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy program planning and plan implementation responsibilities;
  organizational personnel responsible for enterprise risk management;
  organizational personnel responsible for determining information protection
  needs for mission and business processes; organizational personnel with
  information security and privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for defining mission and business
  processes and their information protection needs].
