  Description:

  Establish a Data Governance Body consisting of [Assignment:
  organization-defined roles] with [Assignment: organization-defined
  responsibilities].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A Data Governance Body can help ensure that the organization has coherent
  policies and the ability to balance the utility of data with security and
  privacy requirements. The Data Governance Body establishes policies,
  procedures, and standards that facilitate data governance so that data,
  including personally identifiable information, is effectively managed and
  maintained in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives,
  regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Responsibilities can include
  developing and implementing guidelines that support data modeling, quality,
  integrity, and the de-identification needs of personally identifiable
  information across the information life cycle as well as reviewing and
  approving applications to release data outside of the organization, archiving
  the applications and the released data, and performing post-release monitoring
  to ensure that the assumptions made as part of the data release continue to be
  valid. Members include the chief information officer, senior agency
  information security officer, and senior agency official for privacy. Federal
  agencies are required to establish a Data Governance Body with specific roles
  and responsibilities in accordance with the EVIDACT and policies set forth
  under OMB M-19-23. Related Control(s): AT-2, AT-3, PM-19, PM-22, PM-24, PT-7,
  SI-4, SI-19.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Privacy program plan; documentation relating to the
  Data Governance Body, including documents establishing such a body, its
  charter of operations, and any plans and reports; records of board meetings
  and decisions; records of requests to review data; policies, procedures, and
  standards that facilitate data governance].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Officials serving on the Data Governance Body (e.g.,
  chief information officer, senior agency information security officer, and
  senior agency official for privacy)].
