control-information: >-
  Description:

  Implement a process for receiving and responding to complaints, concerns, or
  questions from individuals about the organizational security and privacy
  practices that includes:

  a. Mechanisms that are easy to use and readily accessible by the public;

  b. All information necessary for successfully filing complaints;

  c. Tracking mechanisms to ensure all complaints received are reviewed and
  addressed within [Assignment: organization-defined time period];

  d. Acknowledgement of receipt of complaints, concerns, or questions from
  individuals within [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and

  e. Response to complaints, concerns, or questions from individuals within
  [Assignment: organization-defined time period].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Complaints, concerns, and questions from individuals can serve as valuable
  sources of input to organizations and ultimately improve operational models,
  uses of technology, data collection practices, and controls. Mechanisms that
  can be used by the public include telephone hotline, email, or web-based
  forms. The information necessary for successfully filing complaints includes
  contact information for the senior agency official for privacy or other
  official designated to receive complaints. Privacy complaints may also include
  personally identifiable information which is handled in accordance with
  relevant policies and processes. Related Control(s): IR-7, IR-9, PM-22, SI-18.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Privacy program plan; procedures addressing complaint
  management; complaint documentation; procedures addressing the reviews of
  complaints; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with privacy program
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for complaint management;
  mechanisms supporting complaint management; tools used by the public to submit
  complaints, concerns, and questions (e.g., telephone, hotline, email, or
  web-based forms].
