control-acronym: "[r5] PM-15"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Establish and institutionalize contact with selected groups and associations
  within the security and privacy communities:

  a. To facilitate ongoing security and privacy education and training for
  organizational personnel;

  b. To maintain currency with recommended security and privacy practices,
  techniques, and technologies; and

  c. To share current security and privacy information, including threats,
  vulnerabilities, and incidents.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Ongoing contact with security and privacy groups and associations is important
  in an environment of rapidly changing technologies and threats. Groups and
  associations include special interest groups, professional associations,
  forums, news groups, usersâ€™ groups, and peer groups of security and privacy
  professionals in similar organizations. Organizations select security and
  privacy groups and associations based on mission and business functions.
  Organizations share threat, vulnerability, and incident information as well as
  contextual insights, compliance techniques, and privacy problems consistent
  with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations,
  standards, and guidelines. Related Control(s): SA-11, SI-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; privacy program
  plan; risk management strategy; procedures for establishing and
  institutionalizing contacts with security and privacy groups and associations;
  lists or other records of contacts with and/or membership in security and
  privacy groups and associations; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy program planning and plan implementation responsibilities;
  organizational personnel responsible for establishing and institutionalizing
  contact with security and privacy groups and associations; organizational
  personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities; personnel
  from selected groups and associations with which the organization has
  established and institutionalized contact].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for establishing and
  institutionalizing contact with security and privacy groups and associations;
  mechanisms supporting contact with security and privacy groups and
  associations].
