control-information: >-
  Description:

  Develop and update [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] an inventory
  of organizational systems.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  OMB A-130 provides guidance on developing systems inventories and associated
  reporting requirements. System inventory refers to an organization-wide
  inventory of systems, not system components as described in CM-8. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; system inventory;
  procedures addressing system inventory development and maintenance; OMB FISMA
  reporting guidance; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  program planning and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational
  personnel responsible for developing and maintaining the system inventory;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for system inventory development
  and maintenance; mechanisms supporting the system inventory].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: PM-5.1; as well as
  the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-004328, CCI-004329,
  CCI-004330. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test
  result/compliance statement: PM-5.1. The resulting compliance status was set
  to non-compliant because of the addition of a new security requirement to the
  assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed: CCI-004328,
  CCI-004329, CCI-004330.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The Program Management (PM) family of
  controls primarily focuses on high-level organizational security governance,
  including policies, risk management strategies, and enterprise-wide planning.
  These controls are typically addressed at the organizational level rather than
  by a specific technology platform like UDS.)
