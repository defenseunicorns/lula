control-acronym: "[r5] PM-03"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Include the resources needed to implement the information security and
  privacy programs in capital planning and investment requests and document all
  exceptions to this requirement;

  b. Prepare documentation required for addressing information security and
  privacy programs in capital planning and investment requests in accordance
  with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations,
  standards; and

  c. Make available for expenditure, the planned information security and
  privacy resources.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations consider establishing champions for information security and
  privacy and, as part of including the necessary resources, assign specialized
  expertise and resources as needed. Organizations may designate and empower an
  Investment Review Board or similar group to manage and provide oversight for
  the information security and privacy aspects of the capital planning and
  investment control process. Related Control(s): PM-4, SA-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; Exhibit 300; Exhibit
  53; business cases for capital planning and investment; procedures for capital
  planning and investment; documentation of exceptions to capital planning
  requirements; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  program planning responsibilities; organizational personnel with privacy
  program planning responsibilities; organizational personnel responsible for
  capital planning and investment; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with privacy
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for capital planning and
  investment; organizational processes for business case, Exhibit 300, and
  Exhibit 53 development; mechanisms supporting the capital planning and
  investment process].

  planned.

  - privacy resources are made available for expenditure as planned.

compliance-status: Not Applicable
test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The Program Management
  (PM) family of controls primarily focuses on high-level organizational
  security governance, including policies, risk management strategies, and
  enterprise-wide planning. These controls are typically addressed at the
  organizational level rather than by a specific technology platform like UDS.)
rev-4-migration-notes: "Automatically generated test result during Revision 5
  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: PM-3.3; as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements:
  CCI-004318. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test
  result/compliance statement: PM-3.3. The resulting compliance status was set
  to non-compliant because of the addition of a new security requirement to the
  assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed: CCI-004318."
