control-acronym: "[r5] PM-32"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Analyze [Assignment: organization-defined systems or systems components]
  supporting mission essential services or functions to ensure that the
  information resources are being used consistent with their intended purpose.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Systems are designed to support a specific mission or business function.
  However, over time, systems and system components may be used to support
  services and functions that are outside of the scope of the intended mission
  or business functions. This can result in exposing information resources to
  unintended environments and uses that can significantly increase threat
  exposure. In doing so, the systems are more vulnerable to compromise, which
  can ultimately impact the services and functions for which they were intended.
  This is especially impactful for mission-essential services and functions. By
  analyzing resource use, organizations can identify such potential exposures.
  Related Control(s): CA-7, PL-2, RA-3, RA-9.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; privacy program
  plan; list of essential services and functions; organizational analysis of
  information resources; risk management strategy; other relevant documents or
  records.].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security,
  privacy, and supply chain risk management program responsibilities].
