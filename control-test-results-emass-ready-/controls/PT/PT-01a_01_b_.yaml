control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop, document, and disseminate to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles]:

  1. [Selection (one or more): Organization-level; Mission/business
  process-level; System-level] personally identifiable information processing
  and transparency policy that:
    (a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
    (b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and
  2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the personally identifiable
  information processing and transparency policy and the associated personally
  identifiable information processing and transparency controls;

  b. Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the
  development, documentation, and dissemination of the personally identifiable
  information processing and transparency policy and procedures; and

  c. Review and update the current personally identifiable information
  processing and transparency:

  1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events]; and

  2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Personally identifiable information processing and transparency policy and
  procedures address the controls in the PT family that are implemented within
  systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor
  in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures
  contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that
  security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of personally
  identifiable information processing and transparency policy and procedures.
  Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level
  are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or
  system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of
  the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies
  that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be
  established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business
  processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or
  controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is
  the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security
  and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may
  precipitate an update to personally identifiable information processing and
  transparency policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings,
  breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives,
  regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls
  does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure. Related Control(s):
  None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Personally identifiable information processing and
  transparency policy and procedures; privacy plan; privacy program plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with personally identifiable
  information processing and transparency responsibilities; organizational
  personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities].
