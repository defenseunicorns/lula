control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop a plan for managing supply chain risks associated with the research
  and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration,
  operations and maintenance, and disposal of the following systems, system
  components or system services: [Assignment: organization-defined systems,
  system components, or system services];

  b. Review and update the supply chain risk management plan [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] or as required, to address threat,
  organizational or environmental changes; and

  c. Protect the supply chain risk management plan from unauthorized disclosure
  and modification.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The dependence on products, systems, and services from external providers, as
  well as the nature of the relationships with those providers, present an
  increasing level of risk to an organization. Threat actions that may increase
  security or privacy risks include unauthorized production, the insertion or
  use of counterfeits, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software and
  hardware, and poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply
  chain. Supply chain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system element
  or component, a system, an organization, a sector, or the Nation. Managing
  supply chain risk is a complex, multifaceted undertaking that requires a
  coordinated effort across an organization to build trust relationships and
  communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Supply chain risk
  management (SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks,
  determining appropriate risk response actions, developing SCRM plans to
  document response actions, and monitoring performance against plans. The SCRM
  plan (at the system-level) is implementation specific, providing policy
  implementation, requirements, constraints and implications. It can either be
  stand-alone, or incorporated into system security and privacy plans. The SCRM
  plan addresses managing, implementation, and monitoring of SCRM controls and
  the development/sustainment of systems across the SDLC to support mission and
  business functions.


  Because supply chains can differ significantly across and within
  organizations, SCRM plans are tailored to the individual program,
  organizational, and operational contexts. Tailored SCRM plans provide the
  basis for determining whether a technology, service, system component, or
  system is fit for purpose, and as such, the controls need to be tailored
  accordingly. Tailored SCRM plans help organizations focus their resources on
  the most critical mission and business functions based on mission and business
  requirements and their risk environment. Supply chain risk management plans
  include an expression of the supply chain risk tolerance for the organization,
  acceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls, a process for
  consistently evaluating and monitoring supply chain risk, approaches for
  implementing and communicating the plan, a description of and justification
  for supply chain risk mitigation measures taken, and associated roles and
  responsibilities. Finally, supply chain risk management plans address
  requirements for developing trustworthy, secure, privacy-protective, and
  resilient system components and systems, including the application of the
  security design principles implemented as part of life cycle-based systems
  security engineering processes (see SA-8). Related Control(s): CA-2, CP-4,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
