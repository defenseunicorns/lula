  supply chain risk management plan; system and services acquisition policy;
  anti-counterfeit plan; anti-counterfeit policy and procedures; media disposal
  policy; media protection policy; incident response policy; training materials
  addressing counterfeit system components; training records on the detection
  and prevention of counterfeit components entering the system; system security
  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with supply chain risk management
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  anti-counterfeit policies, procedures, and training].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for anti-counterfeit training].
