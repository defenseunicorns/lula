control-acronym: "[r5] SR-11"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop and implement anti-counterfeit policy and procedures that include
  the means to detect and prevent counterfeit components from entering the
  system; and

  b. Report counterfeit system components to [Selection (one or more): source of
  counterfeit component; [Assignment: organization-defined external reporting
  organizations]; [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Sources of counterfeit components include manufacturers, developers, vendors,
  and contractors. Anti-counterfeiting policies and procedures support tamper
  resistance and provide a level of protection against the introduction of
  malicious code. External reporting organizations include CISA. Related
  Control(s): PE-3, SA-4, SI-7, SR-9, SR-10.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Supply chain risk management policy and procedures;
  supply chain risk management plan; system and services acquisition policy;
  anti-counterfeit plan; anti-counterfeit policy and procedures; media disposal
  policy; media protection policy; incident response policy; reports notifying
  developers, manufacturers, vendors, contractors, and/or external reporting
  organizations of counterfeit system components; acquisition documentation;
  service level agreements; acquisition contracts for the system, system
  component, or system service; inter-organizational agreements and procedures;
  records of reported counterfeit system components; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and service
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with supply chain risk
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibilities
  for anti-counterfeit policies, procedures, and reporting].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for counterfeit prevention,
  detection, and reporting; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  anti-counterfeit detection, prevention, and reporting].

  Determine if:

  - an anti-counterfeit policy is developed and implemented.

  - anti-counterfeit procedures are developed and implemented. 

  - the anti-counterfeit procedures include the means to detect counterfeit
  components entering the system.

  - the anti-counterfeit procedures include the means to prevent counterfeit
  components from entering the system.

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: SA-19.1, SA-19.2,
  SA-19.3, SA-19.4, SA-19.5, SA-19.6, SA-19.7, SA-19.8; as well as the following
  Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-005132, CCI-005133. The resulting compliance
  status was set to non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment
  procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance statement: SA-19.1,
  SA-19.2. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because of
  the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that
  has not been previously assessed: CCI-005132, CCI-005133.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The organization is responsible for
  the policy though UDS does meet the implementation.)

  UDS excels at supply chain protection. By using Zarf for deployment, all
  software components (containers, manifests) are packaged in a controlled,
  versioned archive. Zarf supports cryptographic signing of packages with
  cosign, and verification of signatures before deployment​. This means the
  organization can be confident that the UDS package they deploy is exactly what
  was released by the provider and hasn't been tampered with. Additionally,
  Zarf’s SBOM generation​ provides a list of all components and their hashes,
  aiding in verifying provenance.
