control-acronym: "[r5] SR-11"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop and implement anti-counterfeit policy and procedures that include
  the means to detect and prevent counterfeit components from entering the
  system; and

  b. Report counterfeit system components to [Selection (one or more): source of
  counterfeit component; [Assignment: organization-defined external reporting
  organizations]; [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Sources of counterfeit components include manufacturers, developers, vendors,
  and contractors. Anti-counterfeiting policies and procedures support tamper
  resistance and provide a level of protection against the introduction of
  malicious code. External reporting organizations include CISA. Related
  Control(s): PE-3, SA-4, SI-7, SR-9, SR-10.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Supply chain risk management policy and procedures;
  supply chain risk management plan; system and services acquisition policy;
  anti-counterfeit plan; anti-counterfeit policy and procedures; media disposal
  policy; media protection policy; incident response policy; reports notifying
  developers, manufacturers, vendors, contractors, and/or external reporting
  organizations of counterfeit system components; acquisition documentation;
  service level agreements; acquisition contracts for the system, system
  component, or system service; inter-organizational agreements and procedures;
  records of reported counterfeit system components; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and service
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with supply chain risk
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibilities
  for anti-counterfeit policies, procedures, and reporting].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for counterfeit prevention,
  detection, and reporting; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  anti-counterfeit detection, prevention, and reporting].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: SA-19.9, SA-19.10,
  SA-19.11; as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-005134,
  CCI-005135, CCI-005136. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally
  entered test result/compliance statement: SA-19.9. The resulting compliance
  status was set to non-compliant because of the addition of a new security
  requirement to the assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed:
  CCI-005134, CCI-005135, CCI-005136.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The organization is responsible for
  reporting outside the scope of UDS.)

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.
