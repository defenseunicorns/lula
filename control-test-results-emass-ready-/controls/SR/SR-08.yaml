  Description:

  Establish agreements and procedures with entities involved in the supply chain
  for the system, system component, or system service for the [Selection (one or
  more): notification of supply chain compromises; results of assessments or
  audits; [Assignment: organization-defined information]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The establishment of agreements and procedures facilitates communications
  among supply chain entities. Early notification of compromises and potential
  compromises in the supply chain that can potentially adversely affect or have
  adversely affected organizational systems or system components is essential
  for organizations to effectively respond to such incidents. The results of
  assessments or audits may include open-source information that contributed to
  a decision or result and could be used to help the supply chain entity resolve
  a concern or improve its processes. Related Control(s): IR-4, IR-6, IR-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
