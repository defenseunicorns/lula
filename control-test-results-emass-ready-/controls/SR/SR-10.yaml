control-acronym: "[r5] SR-10"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Inspect the following systems or system components [Selection (one or more):
  at random; at [Assignment: organization-defined frequency], upon [Assignment:
  organization-defined indications of need for inspection]] to detect tampering:
  [Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The inspection of systems or systems components for tamper resistance and
  detection addresses physical and logical tampering and is applied to systems
  and system components removed from organization-controlled areas. Indications
  of a need for inspection include changes in packaging, specifications, factory
  location, or entity in which the part is purchased, and when individuals
  return from travel to high-risk locations. Related Control(s): AT-3, PM-30,
  SI-4, SI-7, SR-3, SR-4, SR-5, SR-9, SR-11.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Supply chain risk management policy and procedures;
  supply chain risk management plan; system and services acquisition policy;
  records of random inspections; inspection reports/results; assessment
  reports/results; acquisition documentation; service level agreements;
  acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service;
  inter-organizational agreements and procedures; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and services
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with supply chain risk
  management responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for establishing
  inter-organizational agreements and procedures with supply chain entities;
  organizational processes to inspect for tampering].
