control-information: >-
  Description:

  Assess the system, system component, or system service prior to selection,
  acceptance, modification, or update.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizational personnel or independent, external entities conduct assessments
  of systems, components, products, tools, and services to uncover evidence of
  tampering, unintentional and intentional vulnerabilities, or evidence of
  non-compliance with supply chain controls. These include malicious code,
  malicious processes, defective software, backdoors, and counterfeits.
  Assessments can include evaluations; design proposal reviews; visual or
  physical inspection; static and dynamic analyses; visual, x-ray, or magnetic
  particle inspections; simulations; white, gray, or black box testing; fuzz
  testing; stress testing; and penetration testing (see SR-6(1)). Evidence
  generated during assessments is documented for follow-on actions by
  organizations. The evidence generated during the organizational or independent
  assessments of supply chain elements may be used to improve supply chain
  processes and inform the supply chain risk management process. The evidence
  can be leveraged in follow-on assessments. Evidence and other documentation
  may be shared in accordance with organizational agreements. Related
  Control(s): CA-8, RA-5, SA-11, SI-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System security plan; system and services acquisition
  policy; procedures addressing supply chain protection; procedures addressing
  the integration of information security requirements into the acquisition
  process; security test and evaluation results; vulnerability assessment
  results; penetration testing results; organizational risk assessment results;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and services
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with supply chain
  protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for conducting assessments prior
  to selection, acceptance, or update; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  the conducting of assessments prior to selection, acceptance, or update].
