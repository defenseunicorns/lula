control-information: >-
  Description:

  Document, monitor, and maintain valid provenance of the following systems,
  system components, and associated data: [Assignment: organization-defined
  systems, system components, and associated data].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Every system and system component has a point of origin and may be changed
  throughout its existence. Provenance is the chronology of the origin,
  development, ownership, location, and changes to a system or system component
  and associated data. It may also include personnel and processes used to
  interact with or make modifications to the system, component, or associated
  data. Organizations consider developing procedures (see SR-1) for allocating
  responsibilities for the creation, maintenance, and monitoring of provenance
  for systems and system components; transferring provenance documentation and
  responsibility between organizations; and preventing and monitoring for
  unauthorized changes to the provenance records. Organizations have methods to
  document, monitor, and maintain valid provenance baselines for systems, system
  components, and related data. These actions help track, assess, and document
  any changes to the provenance, including changes in supply chain elements or
  configuration, and help ensure non-repudiation of provenance information and
  the provenance change records. Provenance considerations are addressed
  throughout the system development life cycle and incorporated into contracts
  and other arrangements, as appropriate. Related Control(s): CM-8, MA-2, MA-6,
  RA-9, SA-3, SA-8, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Supply chain risk management policy; supply chain risk
  management procedures; supply chain risk management plan; documentation of
  critical systems, critical system components, and associated data;
  documentation showing the history of ownership, custody, and location of and
  changes to critical systems or critical system components; system
  architecture; inter-organizational agreements and procedures; contracts;
  system security plan; privacy plan; personally identifiable information
  processing policy; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with acquisition
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities; organizational personnel with supply chain risk
  management responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for identifying the provenance of
  critical systems and critical system components; mechanisms used to document,
  monitor, or maintain provenance].
