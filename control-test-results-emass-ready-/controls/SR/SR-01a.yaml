control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop, document, and disseminate to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles]:

  1. [Selection (one or more): Organization-level; Mission/business
  process-level; System-level] supply chain risk management policy that:
    (a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
    (b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and
  2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the supply chain risk
  management policy and the associated supply chain risk management controls;

  b. Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the
  development, documentation, and dissemination of the supply chain risk
  management policy and procedures; and

  c. Review and update the current supply chain risk management:

  1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events]; and

  2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Supply chain risk management policy and procedures address the controls in the
  SR family as well as supply chain-related controls in other families that are
  implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is
  an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and
  procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is
  important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of
  supply chain risk management policy and procedures. Security and privacy
  program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in
  general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and
  procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and
  privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex
  nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and
  privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if
  needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and
  can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
  Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or
  more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to supply chain
  risk management policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings,
  security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive
  orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply
  restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Supply chain risk management policy; supply chain risk
  management procedures; system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with supply chain risk
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with enterprise risk
  management responsibilities].
