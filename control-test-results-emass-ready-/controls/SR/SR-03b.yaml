control-acronym: "[r5] SR-03"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Establish a process or processes to identify and address weaknesses or
  deficiencies in the supply chain elements and processes of [Assignment:
  organization-defined system or system component] in coordination with
  [Assignment: organization-defined supply chain personnel];

  b. Employ the following controls to protect against supply chain risks to the
  system, system component, or system service and to limit the harm or
  consequences from supply chain-related events: [Assignment:
  organization-defined supply chain controls]; and

  c. Document the selected and implemented supply chain processes and controls
  in [Selection: security and privacy plans; supply chain risk management plan;
  [Assignment: organization-defined document]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Supply chain elements include organizations, entities, or tools employed for
  the research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery,
  integration, operations and maintenance, and disposal of systems and system
  components. Supply chain processes include hardware, software, and firmware
  development processes; shipping and handling procedures; personnel security
  and physical security programs; configuration management tools, techniques,
  and measures to maintain provenance; or other programs, processes, or
  procedures associated with the development, acquisition, maintenance and
  disposal of systems and system components. Supply chain elements and processes
  may be provided by organizations, system integrators, or external providers.
  Weaknesses or deficiencies in supply chain elements or processes represent
  potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversaries to cause harm
  to the organization and affect its ability to carry out its core missions or
  business functions. Supply chain personnel are individuals with roles and
  responsibilities in the supply chain. Related Control(s): CA-2, MA-2, MA-6,
  PE-3, PE-16, PL-8, PM-30, SA-2, SA-3, SA-4, SA-5, SA-8, SA-9, SA-10, SA-15,
  SC-7, SC-29, SC-30, SC-38, SI-7, SR-6, SR-9, SR-11.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Supply chain risk management policy; supply chain risk
  management procedures; supply chain risk management strategy; supply chain
  risk management plan; systems and critical system components inventory
  documentation; system and services acquisition policy; system and services
  acquisition procedures; procedures addressing the integration of information
  security and privacy requirements into the acquisition process; solicitation
  documentation; acquisition documentation (including purchase orders); service
  level agreements; acquisition contracts for systems or services; risk register
  documentation; system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with acquisition
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities; organizational personnel with supply chain risk
  management responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for identifying and addressing
  supply chain element and process deficiencies].

  UDS excels at supply chain protection. By using Zarf for deployment, all
  software components (containers, manifests) are packaged in a controlled,
  versioned archive. Zarf supports cryptographic signing of packages with
  cosign, and verification of signatures before deployment​. This means the
  organization can be confident that the UDS package they deploy is exactly what
  was released by the provider and hasn't been tampered with. Additionally,
  Zarf’s SBOM generation​ provides a list of all components and their hashes,
  aiding in verifying provenance. NeuVector ensures no unvetted container images
  slip in. Most components in UDS are open source, so it can be scrutinized for
  malicious code (transparency). The net effect is a significantly reduced risk
  of supply chain attacks: only approved images from the Zarf package run.
rev-4-migration-notes: "Automatically generated test result during Revision 5
  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: SA-12.1, SA-12.2; as well as the following Rev. 5 security
  requirements: CCI-005086, CCI-005087, CCI-005088. The resulting compliance
  status was set to non-compliant because of the addition of a new security
  requirement to the assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed:
  CCI-005086, CCI-005087, CCI-005088."
