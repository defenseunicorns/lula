control-acronym: "[r5] SR-12"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Dispose of [Assignment: organization-defined data, documentation, tools, or
  system components] using the following techniques and methods: [Assignment:
  organization-defined techniques and methods].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Data, documentation, tools, or system components can be disposed of at any
  time during the system development life cycle (not only in the disposal or
  retirement phase of the life cycle). For example, disposal can occur during
  research and development, design, prototyping, or operations/maintenance and
  include methods such as disk cleaning, removal of cryptographic keys, partial
  reuse of components. Opportunities for compromise during disposal affect
  physical and logical data, including system documentation in paper-based or
  digital files; shipping and delivery documentation; memory sticks with
  software code; or complete routers or servers that include permanent media,
  which contain sensitive or proprietary information. Additionally, proper
  disposal of system components helps to prevent such components from entering
  the gray market. Related Control(s): MP-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Supply chain risk management policy and procedures;
  supply chain risk management plan; disposal procedures addressing supply chain
  protection; media disposal policy; media protection policy; disposal records
  for system components; documentation of the system components identified for
  disposal; documentation of the disposal techniques and methods employed for
  system components; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system component
  disposal responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with supply chain protection
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational techniques and methods for system component
  disposal; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing system component
  disposal].
