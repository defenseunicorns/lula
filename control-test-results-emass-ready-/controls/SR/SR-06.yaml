control-information: >-
  Description:

  Assess and review the supply chain-related risks associated with suppliers or
  contractors and the system, system component, or system service they provide
  [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  An assessment and review of supplier risk includes security and supply chain
  risk management processes, foreign ownership, control or influence (FOCI), and
  the ability of the supplier to effectively assess subordinate second-tier and
  third-tier suppliers and contractors. The reviews may be conducted by the
  organization or by an independent third party. The reviews consider documented
  processes, documented controls, all-source intelligence, and publicly
  available information related to the supplier or contractor. Organizations can
  use open-source information to monitor for indications of stolen information,
  poor development and quality control practices, information spillage, or
  counterfeits. In some cases, it may be appropriate or required to share
  assessment and review results with other organizations in accordance with any
  applicable rules, policies, or inter-organizational agreements or contracts.
  Related Control(s): SR-3, SR-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Supply chain risk management policy and procedures;
  supply chain risk management strategy; supply chain risk management plan;
  system and services acquisition policy; procedures addressing supply chain
  protection; procedures addressing the integration of information security
  requirements into the acquisition process; records of supplier due diligence
  reviews; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and services
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with supply chain
  protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for conducting supplier reviews;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing supplier reviews].
