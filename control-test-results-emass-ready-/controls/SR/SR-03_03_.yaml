control-information: >-
  Description:

  Ensure that the controls included in the contracts of prime contractors are
  also included in the contracts of subcontractors.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  To manage supply chain risk effectively and holistically, it is important that
  organizations ensure that supply chain risk management controls are included
  at all tiers in the supply chain. This includes ensuring that Tier 1 (prime)
  contractors have implemented processes to facilitate the flow down of supply
  chain risk management controls to sub-tier contractors. The controls subject
  to flow down are identified in SR-3b. Related Control(s): SR-5, SR-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Supply chain risk management policy and procedures;
  supply chain risk management plan; system and services acquisition policy;
  procedures addressing supply chain protection; acquisition documentation;
  service level agreements; acquisition contracts for the system, system
  component, or system service; inter-organizational agreements and procedures;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and services
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with supply chain risk
  management responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for establishing
  inter-organizational agreements and procedures with supply chain entities].
