  Description:

  Employ the following acquisition strategies, contract tools, and procurement
  methods to protect against, identify, and mitigate supply chain risks:
  [Assignment: organization-defined acquisition strategies, contract tools, and
  procurement methods].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The use of the acquisition process provides an important vehicle to protect
  the supply chain. There are many useful tools and techniques available,
  including obscuring the end use of a system or system component, using blind
  or filtered buys, requiring tamper-evident packaging, or using trusted or
  controlled distribution. The results from a supply chain risk assessment can
  guide and inform the strategies, tools, and methods that are most applicable
  to the situation. Tools and techniques may provide protections against
  unauthorized production, theft, tampering, insertion of counterfeits,
  insertion of malicious software or backdoors, and poor development practices
  throughout the system development life cycle. Organizations also consider
  providing incentives for suppliers who implement controls, promote
  transparency into their processes and security and privacy practices, provide
  contract language that addresses the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit
  components, and restrict purchases from untrustworthy suppliers. Organizations
  consider providing training, education, and awareness programs for personnel
  regarding supply chain risk, available mitigation strategies, and when the
  programs should be employed. Methods for reviewing and protecting development
  plans, documentation, and evidence are commensurate with the security and
  privacy requirements of the organization. Contracts may specify documentation
  protection requirements. Related Control(s): AT-3, SA-2, SA-3, SA-4, SA-5,
  SA-8, SA-9, SA-10, SA-15, SR-6, SR-9, SR-10, SR-11.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Supply chain risk management policy; supply chain risk
  management procedures; supply chain risk management plan; system and services
  acquisition policy; system and services acquisition procedures; procedures
  addressing supply chain protection; procedures addressing the integration of
  information security and privacy requirements into the acquisition process;
  solicitation documentation; acquisition documentation (including purchase
  orders); service level agreements; acquisition contracts for systems, system
  components, or services; documentation of training, education, and awareness
  programs for personnel regarding supply chain risk; system security plan;
  privacy plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with acquisition
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities; organizational personnel with supply chain risk
  management responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for defining and employing
  tailored acquisition strategies, contract tools, and procurement methods;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the definition and employment of
  tailored acquisition strategies, contract tools, and procurement methods].
