  Description:

  Establish a supply chain risk management team consisting of [Assignment:
  organization-defined personnel, roles, and responsibilities] to lead and
  support the following SCRM activities: [Assignment: organization-defined
  supply chain risk management activities].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  To implement supply chain risk management plans, organizations establish a
  coordinated, team-based approach to identify and assess supply chain risks and
  manage these risks by using programmatic and technical mitigation techniques.
  The team approach enables organizations to conduct an analysis of their supply
  chain, communicate with internal and external partners or stakeholders, and
  gain broad consensus regarding the appropriate resources for SCRM. The SCRM
  team consists of organizational personnel with diverse roles and
  responsibilities for leading and supporting SCRM activities, including risk
  executive, information technology, contracting, information security, privacy,
  mission or business, legal, supply chain and logistics, acquisition, business
  continuity, and other relevant functions. Members of the SCRM team are
  involved in various aspects of the SDLC and, collectively, have an awareness
  of and provide expertise in acquisition processes, legal practices,
  vulnerabilities, threats, and attack vectors, as well as an understanding of
  the technical aspects and dependencies of systems. The SCRM team can be an
  extension of the security and privacy risk management processes or be included
  as part of an organizational risk management team. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
