  Description:

  Check media containing diagnostic and test programs for malicious code before
  the media are used in the system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  If, upon inspection of media containing maintenance, diagnostic, and test
  programs, organizations determine that the media contains malicious code, the
  incident is handled consistent with organizational incident handling policies
  and procedures. Related Control(s): SI-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Maintenance policy; procedures addressing system
  maintenance tools; system maintenance tools and associated documentation;
  maintenance records; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system maintenance
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational process for inspecting media for malicious
  code; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the inspection of media used
  for maintenance].
