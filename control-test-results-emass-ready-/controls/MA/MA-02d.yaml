control-acronym: "[r5] MA-02"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Schedule, document, and review records of maintenance, repair, and
  replacement on system components in accordance with manufacturer or vendor
  specifications and/or organizational requirements;

  b. Approve and monitor all maintenance activities, whether performed on site
  or remotely and whether the system or system components are serviced on site
  or removed to another location;

  c. Require that [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]
  explicitly approve the removal of the system or system components from
  organizational facilities for off-site maintenance, repair, or replacement;

  d. Sanitize equipment to remove the following information from associated
  media prior to removal from organizational facilities for off-site
  maintenance, repair, or replacement: [Assignment: organization-defined
  information];

  e. Check all potentially impacted controls to verify that the controls are
  still functioning properly following maintenance, repair, or replacement
  actions; and

  f. Include the following information in organizational maintenance records:
  [Assignment: organization-defined information].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Controlling system maintenance addresses the information security aspects of
  the system maintenance program and applies to all types of maintenance to
  system components conducted by local or nonlocal entities. Maintenance
  includes peripherals such as scanners, copiers, and printers. Information
  necessary for creating effective maintenance records includes the date and
  time of maintenance, a description of the maintenance performed, names of the
  individuals or group performing the maintenance, name of the escort, and
  system components or equipment that are removed or replaced. Organizations
  consider supply chain-related risks associated with replacement components for
  systems. Related Control(s): CM-2, CM-3, CM-4, CM-5, CM-8, MA-4, MP-6, PE-16,
  SI-2, SR-3, SR-4, SR-11.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Maintenance policy; procedures addressing controlled
  system maintenance; maintenance records; manufacturer/vendor maintenance
  specifications; equipment sanitization records; media sanitization records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system maintenance
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; organizational personnel responsible for media sanitization;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for scheduling, performing,
  documenting, reviewing, approving, and monitoring maintenance and repairs for
  the system; organizational processes for sanitizing system components;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing controlled maintenance; mechanisms
  implementing the sanitization of system components].
