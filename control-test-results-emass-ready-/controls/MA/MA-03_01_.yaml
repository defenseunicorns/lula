  Description:

  Inspect the maintenance tools used by maintenance personnel for improper or
  unauthorized modifications.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Maintenance tools can be directly brought into a facility by maintenance
  personnel or downloaded from a vendorâ€™s website. If, upon inspection of the
  maintenance tools, organizations determine that the tools have been modified
  in an improper manner or the tools contain malicious code, the incident is
  handled consistent with organizational policies and procedures for incident
  handling. Related Control(s): SI-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Maintenance policy; procedures addressing system
  maintenance tools; system maintenance tools and associated documentation;

  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system maintenance
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for inspecting maintenance tools;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the inspection of maintenance
  tools].
