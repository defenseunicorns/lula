control-acronym: "[r5] MA-04(03)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Require that nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic services be performed
  from a system that implements a security capability comparable to the
  capability implemented on the system being serviced; or

  (b) Remove the component to be serviced from the system prior to nonlocal
  maintenance or diagnostic services; sanitize the component (for organizational
  information); and after the service is performed, inspect and sanitize the
  component (for potentially malicious software) before reconnecting the
  component to the system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Comparable security capability on systems, diagnostic tools, and equipment
  providing maintenance services implies that the implemented controls on those
  systems, tools, and equipment are at least as comprehensive as the controls on
  the system being serviced. Related Control(s): MP-6, SI-3, SI-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Maintenance policy; procedures addressing nonlocal
  system maintenance; service provider contracts and/or service-level
  agreements; maintenance records; inspection records; audit records; equipment
  sanitization records; media sanitization records; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system maintenance
  responsibilities; system maintenance provider; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; organizational personnel responsible
  for media sanitization; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for comparable security and
  sanitization for nonlocal maintenance; organizational processes for the
  removal, sanitization, and inspection of components serviced via nonlocal
  maintenance; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing component sanitization
  and inspection].

  Determine if:

  - nonlocal maintenance services are required to be performed from a system
  that implements a security capability comparable to the capability implemented
  on the system being serviced.

  - nonlocal diagnostic services are required to be performed from a system that
  implements a security capability comparable to the capability implemented on
  the system being serviced.

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: MA-4(3).1. The
  resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following
  Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance
  statement: MA-4(3).1.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (All maintenance would be considered
  local maintenance as admins would either be provided by the organization or
  contracted.)
