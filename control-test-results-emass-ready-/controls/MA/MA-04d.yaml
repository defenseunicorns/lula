control-acronym: "[r5] MA-04"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Approve and monitor nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities;

  b. Allow the use of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic tools only as
  consistent with organizational policy and documented in the security plan for
  the system;

  c. Employ strong authentication in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance
  and diagnostic sessions;

  d. Maintain records for nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities; and

  e. Terminate session and network connections when nonlocal maintenance is
  completed.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are conducted by individuals
  who communicate through either an external or internal network. Local
  maintenance and diagnostic activities are carried out by individuals who are
  physically present at the system location and not communicating across a
  network connection. Authentication techniques used to establish nonlocal
  maintenance and diagnostic sessions reflect the network access requirements in
  IA-2. Strong authentication requires authenticators that are resistant to
  replay attacks and employ multi-factor authentication. Strong authenticators
  include PKI where certificates are stored on a token protected by a password,
  passphrase, or biometric. Enforcing requirements in MA-4 is accomplished, in
  part, by other controls. SP 800-63B provides additional guidance on strong
  authentication and authenticators. Related Control(s): AC-2, AC-3, AC-6,
  AC-17, AU-2, AU-3, IA-2, IA-4, IA-5, IA-8, MA-2, MA-5, PL-2, SC-7, SC-10.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Maintenance policy; procedures addressing nonlocal
  system maintenance; remote access policy; remote access procedures; system
  design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; maintenance records; records of remote access; diagnostic
  records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system maintenance
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing nonlocal
  maintenance; mechanisms implementing, supporting, and/or managing nonlocal
  maintenance; mechanisms for strong authentication of nonlocal maintenance
  diagnostic sessions; mechanisms for terminating nonlocal maintenance sessions
  and network connections].
