  Description:

  Implement the following cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity and
  confidentiality of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic communications:
  [Assignment: organization-defined cryptographic mechanisms].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Failure to protect nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic communications can
  result in unauthorized individuals gaining access to organizational
  information. Unauthorized access during remote maintenance sessions can result
  in a variety of hostile actions, including malicious code insertion,
  unauthorized changes to system parameters, and exfiltration of organizational
  information. Such actions can result in the loss or degradation of mission or
  business capabilities. Related Control(s): SC-8, SC-12, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Maintenance policy; procedures addressing nonlocal
  system maintenance; system design documentation; system configuration settings
  and associated documentation; cryptographic mechanisms protecting nonlocal
  maintenance activities; maintenance records; diagnostic records; audit
  records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system maintenance
  responsibilities; network engineers; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Cryptographic mechanisms protecting nonlocal maintenance
  and diagnostic communications].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: MA-4(6).1,
  MA-4(6).2; as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-004193.
  The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following
  Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance
  statement: MA-4(6).1, MA-4(6).2. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because of the addition of a new security requirement to the
  assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed: CCI-004193.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (All maintenance would be considered
  local maintenance as admins would either be provided by the organization or
  contracted.)
