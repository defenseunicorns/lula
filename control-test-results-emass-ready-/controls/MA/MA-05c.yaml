control-acronym: "[r5] MA-05"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Establish a process for maintenance personnel authorization and maintain a
  list of authorized maintenance organizations or personnel;

  b. Verify that non-escorted personnel performing maintenance on the system
  possess the required access authorizations; and

  c. Designate organizational personnel with required access authorizations and
  technical competence to supervise the maintenance activities of personnel who
  do not possess the required access authorizations.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Maintenance personnel refers to individuals who perform hardware or software
  maintenance on organizational systems, while PE-2 addresses physical access
  for individuals whose maintenance duties place them within the physical
  protection perimeter of the systems. Technical competence of supervising
  individuals relates to the maintenance performed on the systems, while having
  required access authorizations refers to maintenance on and near the systems.
  Individuals not previously identified as authorized maintenance personnel—such
  as information technology manufacturers, vendors, systems integrators, and
  consultants—may require privileged access to organizational systems, such as
  when they are required to conduct maintenance activities with little or no
  notice. Based on organizational assessments of risk, organizations may issue
  temporary credentials to these individuals. Temporary credentials may be for
  one-time use or for very limited time periods. Related Control(s): AC-2, AC-3,
  AC-5, AC-6, IA-2, IA-8, MA-4, MP-2, PE-2, PE-3, PS-7, RA-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Maintenance policy; procedures addressing maintenance
  personnel; service provider contracts; service-level agreements; list of
  authorized personnel; maintenance records; access control records; system
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system maintenance
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for authorizing and managing
  maintenance personnel; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing authorization
  of maintenance personnel].
