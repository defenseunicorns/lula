  Description:

  Perform preventive maintenance on [Assignment: organization-defined system
  components] at [Assignment: organization-defined time intervals].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Preventive maintenance includes proactive care and the servicing of system
  components to maintain organizational equipment and facilities in satisfactory
  operating condition. Such maintenance provides for the systematic inspection,
  tests, measurements, adjustments, parts replacement, detection, and correction
  of incipient failures either before they occur or before they develop into
  major defects. The primary goal of preventive maintenance is to avoid or
  mitigate the consequences of equipment failures. Preventive maintenance is
  designed to preserve and restore equipment reliability by replacing worn
  components before they fail. Methods of determining what preventive (or other)
  failure management policies to apply include original equipment manufacturer
  recommendations; statistical failure records; expert opinion; maintenance that
  has already been conducted on similar equipment; requirements of codes, laws,
  or regulations within a jurisdiction; or measured values and performance
  indications. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
