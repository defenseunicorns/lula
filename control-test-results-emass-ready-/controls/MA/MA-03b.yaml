control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Approve, control, and monitor the use of system maintenance tools; and

  b. Review previously approved system maintenance tools [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Approving, controlling, monitoring, and reviewing maintenance tools address
  security-related issues associated with maintenance tools that are not within
  system authorization boundaries and are used specifically for diagnostic and
  repair actions on organizational systems. Organizations have flexibility in
  determining roles for the approval of maintenance tools and how that approval
  is documented. A periodic review of maintenance tools facilitates the
  withdrawal of approval for outdated, unsupported, irrelevant, or
  no-longer-used tools. Maintenance tools can include hardware, software, and
  firmware items and may be pre-installed, brought in with maintenance personnel
  on media, cloud-based, or downloaded from a website. Such tools can be
  vehicles for transporting malicious code, either intentionally or
  unintentionally, into a facility and subsequently into systems. Maintenance
  tools can include hardware and software diagnostic test equipment and packet
  sniffers. The hardware and software components that support maintenance and
  are a part of the system (including the software implementing utilities such
  as ping, ls, ipconfig, or the hardware and software implementing the
  monitoring port of an Ethernet switch) are not addressed by maintenance tools.
  Related Control(s): MA-2, PE-16.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Maintenance policy; procedures addressing system
  maintenance tools; system maintenance tools and associated documentation;
  maintenance records; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system maintenance
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for approving, controlling, and
  monitoring maintenance tools; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the
  approval, control, and/or monitoring of maintenance tools].
