  Description:

  (a) Log [Assignment: organization-defined audit events] for nonlocal
  maintenance and diagnostic sessions; and

  (b) Review the audit records of the maintenance and diagnostic sessions to
  detect anomalous behavior.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit logging for nonlocal maintenance is enforced by AU-2. Audit events are
  defined in AU-2a. Related Control(s): AU-6, AU-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Maintenance policy; procedures addressing nonlocal
  system maintenance; list of audit events; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; maintenance records; diagnostic records; audit
  records; reviews of maintenance and diagnostic session records; system
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system maintenance
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with audit and review
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for audit and review of nonlocal
  maintenance; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing audit and review of
  nonlocal maintenance].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: MA-4(1).3. The
  resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following
  Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance
  statement: MA-4(1).3.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (All maintenance would be considered
  local maintenance as admins would either be provided by the organization or
  contracted.)
