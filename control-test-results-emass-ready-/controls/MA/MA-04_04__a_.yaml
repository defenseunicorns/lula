control-acronym: "[r5] MA-04(04)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Protect nonlocal maintenance sessions by:

  (a) Employing [Assignment: organization-defined authenticators that are replay
  resistant]; and

  (b) Separating the maintenance sessions from other network sessions with the
  system by either:

  (1) Physically separated communications paths; or

  (2) Logically separated communications paths.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Communications paths can be logically separated using encryption. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Maintenance policy; procedures addressing nonlocal
  system maintenance; system design documentation; system configuration settings
  and associated documentation; maintenance records; audit records; system
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system maintenance
  responsibilities; network engineers; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for protecting nonlocal
  maintenance sessions; mechanisms implementing replay-resistant authenticators;
  mechanisms implementing logically separated/encrypted communication paths].
