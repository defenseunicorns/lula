  Description:

  Verify session and network connection termination after the completion of
  nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Verifying the termination of a connection once maintenance is completed
  ensures that connections established during nonlocal maintenance and
  diagnostic sessions have been terminated and are no longer available for use.
  Related Control(s): AC-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Maintenance policy; procedures addressing nonlocal
  system maintenance; system design documentation; system configuration settings
  and associated documentation; session/network termination logs; cryptographic
  mechanisms protecting nonlocal maintenance activities; maintenance records;
  diagnostic records; audit records; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system maintenance
  responsibilities; network engineers; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing remote disconnect verifications of
  terminated nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions].

  Determine if:

  - session connection termination is verified after the completion of nonlocal
  maintenance and diagnostic sessions.

  - network connection termination is verified after the completion of nonlocal

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: MA-4(7).1. The
  resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following
  Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance
  statement: MA-4(7).1.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (All maintenance would be considered
  local maintenance as admins would either be provided by the organization or
  contracted.)
