  Description:

  a. Develop, document, and disseminate to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles]:

  1. [Selection (one or more): Organization-level; Mission/business
  process-level; System-level] maintenance policy that:
    (a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
    (b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and
  2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the maintenance policy and
  the associated maintenance controls;

  b. Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the
  development, documentation, and dissemination of the maintenance policy and
  procedures; and

  c. Review and update the current maintenance:

  1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events]; and

  2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Maintenance policy and procedures address the controls in the MA family that
  are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy
  is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies
  and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is
  important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of
  maintenance policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and
  procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may
  obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The
  policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or
  be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of
  organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy
  programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed.
  Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be
  directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
  Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or
  more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to maintenance
  policy and procedures assessment or audit findings, security incidents or
  breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives,
  regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls
  does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure. Related Control(s):
  PM-9, PS-8, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Maintenance policy and procedures; system security
  plan; privacy plan; organizational risk management strategy; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with maintenance
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities].
