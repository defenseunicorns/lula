  Description:

  Prevent the removal of maintenance equipment containing organizational
  information by:

  (a) Verifying that there is no organizational information contained on the
  equipment;

  (b) Sanitizing or destroying the equipment;

  (c) Retaining the equipment within the facility; or

  (d) Obtaining an exemption from [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
  roles] explicitly authorizing removal of the equipment from the facility.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizational information includes all information owned by organizations and
  any information provided to organizations for which the organizations serve as
  information stewards. Related Control(s): MP-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Maintenance policy; procedures addressing system
  maintenance tools; system maintenance tools and associated documentation;
  maintenance records; equipment sanitization records; media sanitization
  records; exemptions for equipment removal; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system maintenance
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; organizational personnel responsible for media
  sanitization].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational process for preventing unauthorized removal
  of information; mechanisms supporting media sanitization or destruction of
  equipment; mechanisms supporting verification of media sanitization].
