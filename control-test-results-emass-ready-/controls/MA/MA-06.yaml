control-information: >-
  Description:

  Obtain maintenance support and/or spare parts for [Assignment:
  organization-defined system components] within [Assignment:
  organization-defined time period] of failure.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations specify the system components that result in increased risk to
  organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the
  Nation when the functionality provided by those components is not operational.
  Organizational actions to obtain maintenance support include having
  appropriate contracts in place. Related Control(s): CM-8, CP-2, CP-7, RA-7,
  SA-15, SI-13, SR-2, SR-3, SR-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Maintenance policy; procedures addressing system
  maintenance; service provider contracts; service-level agreements; inventory
  and availability of spare parts; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system maintenance
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with acquisition responsibilities;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for ensuring timely maintenance].
