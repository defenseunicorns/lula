control-acronym: "[r5] PS-05"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Review and confirm ongoing operational need for current logical and
  physical access authorizations to systems and facilities when individuals are
  reassigned or transferred to other positions within the organization;

  b. Initiate [Assignment: organization-defined transfer or reassignment
  actions] within [Assignment: organization-defined time period following the
  formal transfer action];

  c. Modify access authorization as needed to correspond with any changes in
  operational need due to reassignment or transfer; and

  d. Notify [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] within
  [Assignment: organization-defined time period].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Personnel transfer applies when reassignments or transfers of individuals are
  permanent or of such extended duration as to make the actions warranted.
  Organizations define actions appropriate for the types of reassignments or
  transfers, whether permanent or extended. Actions that may be required for
  personnel transfers or reassignments to other positions within organizations
  include returning old and issuing new keys, identification cards, and building
  passes; closing system accounts and establishing new accounts; changing system
  access authorizations (i.e., privileges); and providing for access to official
  records to which individuals had access at previous work locations and in
  previous system accounts. Related Control(s): AC-2, IA-4, PE-2, PM-12, PS-4,
  PS-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Personnel security policy; procedures addressing
  personnel transfer; records of personnel transfer actions; list of system and
  facility access authorizations; system security plan; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with personnel security
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for personnel transfer;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing personnel transfer notifications;
  mechanisms for disabling system access/revoking authenticators].
