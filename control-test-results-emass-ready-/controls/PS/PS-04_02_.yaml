control-information: >-
  Description:

  Use [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms] to [Selection (one
  or more): notify [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] of
  individual termination actions; disable access to system resources].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  In organizations with many employees, not all personnel who need to know about
  termination actions receive the appropriate notifications, or if such
  notifications are received, they may not occur in a timely manner. Automated
  mechanisms can be used to send automatic alerts or notifications to
  organizational personnel or roles when individuals are terminated. Such
  automatic alerts or notifications can be conveyed in a variety of ways,
  including via telephone, electronic mail, text message, or websites. Automated
  mechanisms can also be employed to quickly and thoroughly disable access to
  system resources after an employee is terminated. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Personnel security policy; procedures addressing
  personnel termination; system design documentation; system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; records of personnel termination
  actions; automated notifications of employee terminations; system security
  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with personnel security
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for personnel termination;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing personnel termination
  notifications].

  organization-defined personnel or roles of individual termination actions;
  and/or disable access to system resources.; 003030: Defines the personnel or

implementation-guidance: CCI-003030 of this assessment procedure is
  automatically compliant because of coverage by DoD Enterprise.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS is unrelated to personnel
  security controls, which cover hiring, transfer, agreements, termination,
  etc.)

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the

rev-4-migration-notes: "Automatically generated test result during Revision 5
  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: PS-4.9, PS-4.10, PS-4.11; as well as the following Rev. 5 security
  requirements: CCI-004512. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally
  entered test result/compliance statement: PS-4.9. The resulting compliance
  status was set to non-compliant because of the addition of a new security
  requirement to the assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed:
  CCI-004512."
