control-acronym: "[r5] PS-06"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop and document access agreements for organizational systems;

  b. Review and update the access agreements [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency]; and

  c. Verify that individuals requiring access to organizational information and
  systems:

  1. Sign appropriate access agreements prior to being granted access; and

  2. Re-sign access agreements to maintain access to organizational systems when
  access agreements have been updated or [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Access agreements include nondisclosure agreements, acceptable use agreements,
  rules of behavior, and conflict-of-interest agreements. Signed access
  agreements include an acknowledgement that individuals have read, understand,
  and agree to abide by the constraints associated with organizational systems
  to which access is authorized. Organizations can use electronic signatures to
  acknowledge access agreements unless specifically prohibited by organizational
  policy. Related Control(s): AC-17, PE-2, PL-4, PS-2, PS-3, PS-6, PS-7, PS-8,
  SA-21, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Personnel security policy; personnel security
  procedures; procedures addressing access agreements for organizational
  information and systems; access control policy; access control procedures;
  access agreements (including non-disclosure agreements, acceptable use
  agreements, rules of behavior, and conflict-of-interest agreements);
  documentation of access agreement reviews, updates, and re-signing; system
  security plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with personnel security
  responsibilities; organizational personnel who have signed/resigned access
  agreements; organizational personnel with information security and privacy
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for reviewing, updating, and
  re-signing access agreements; mechanisms supporting the reviewing, updating,
  and re-signing of access agreements].
