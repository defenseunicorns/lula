control-acronym: "[r5] PS-04"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Upon termination of individual employment:

  a. Disable system access within [Assignment: organization-defined time
  period];

  b. Terminate or revoke any authenticators and credentials associated with the
  individual;

  c. Conduct exit interviews that include a discussion of [Assignment:
  organization-defined information security topics];

  d. Retrieve all security-related organizational system-related property; and

  e. Retain access to organizational information and systems formerly controlled
  by terminated individual.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  System property includes hardware authentication tokens, system administration
  technical manuals, keys, identification cards, and building passes. Exit
  interviews ensure that terminated individuals understand the security
  constraints imposed by being former employees and that proper accountability
  is achieved for system-related property. Security topics at exit interviews
  include reminding individuals of nondisclosure agreements and potential
  limitations on future employment. Exit interviews may not always be possible
  for some individuals, including in cases related to the unavailability of
  supervisors, illnesses, or job abandonment. Exit interviews are important for
  individuals with security clearances. The timely execution of termination
  actions is essential for individuals who have been terminated for cause. In
  certain situations, organizations consider disabling the system accounts of
  individuals who are being terminated prior to the individuals being notified.
  Related Control(s): AC-2, IA-4, PE-2, PM-12, PS-6, PS-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Personnel security policy; procedures addressing
  personnel termination; records of personnel termination actions; list of
  system accounts; records of terminated or revoked authenticators/credentials;
  records of exit interviews; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with personnel security
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for personnel termination;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing personnel termination notifications;
  mechanisms for disabling system access/revoking authenticators].
