control-acronym: "[r5] PS-07"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Establish personnel security requirements, including security roles and
  responsibilities for external providers;

  b. Require external providers to comply with personnel security policies and
  procedures established by the organization;

  c. Document personnel security requirements;

  d. Require external providers to notify [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles] of any personnel transfers or terminations of external
  personnel who possess organizational credentials and/or badges, or who have
  system privileges within [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and

  e. Monitor provider compliance with personnel security requirements.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  External provider refers to organizations other than the organization
  operating or acquiring the system. External providers include service bureaus,
  contractors, and other organizations that provide system development,
  information technology services, testing or assessment services, outsourced
  applications, and network/security management. Organizations explicitly
  include personnel security requirements in acquisition-related documents.
  External providers may have personnel working at organizational facilities
  with credentials, badges, or system privileges issued by organizations.
  Notifications of external personnel changes ensure the appropriate termination
  of privileges and credentials. Organizations define the transfers and
  terminations deemed reportable by security-related characteristics that
  include functions, roles, and the nature of credentials or privileges
  associated with transferred or terminated individuals. Related Control(s):

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Personnel security policy; procedures addressing
  external personnel security; list of personnel security requirements;
  acquisition documents; service-level agreements; compliance monitoring
  process; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with personnel security
  responsibilities; external providers; system/network administrators;
  organizational personnel with account management responsibilities;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing and monitoring
  external personnel security; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the
  monitoring of provider compliance].
