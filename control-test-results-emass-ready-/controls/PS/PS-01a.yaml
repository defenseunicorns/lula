control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop, document, and disseminate to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles]:

  1. [Selection (one or more): Organization-level; Mission/business
  process-level; System-level] personnel security policy that:
    (a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
    (b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and
  2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the personnel security
  policy and the associated personnel security controls;

  b. Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the
  development, documentation, and dissemination of the personnel security policy
  and procedures; and

  c. Review and update the current personnel security:

  1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events]; and

  2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Personnel security policy and procedures for the controls in the PS family
  that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management
  strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures.
  Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance.
  Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on
  their development. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the
  organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for
  mission level or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be
  included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented
  by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations.
  Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for
  mission/business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe
  how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the
  individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be
  documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate
  documents. Events that may precipitate an update to personnel security policy
  and procedures include, but are not limited to, assessment or audit findings,
  security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive
  orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply
  restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.
  Related Control(s): PM-9, PS-8, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Personnel security policy; personnel security
  procedures; system security plan; privacy plan; risk management strategy
  documentation; audit findings; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with personnel security
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].
