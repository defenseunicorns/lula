control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Screen individuals prior to authorizing access to the system; and

  b. Rescreen individuals in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined
  conditions requiring rescreening and, where rescreening is so indicated, the
  frequency of rescreening].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Personnel screening and rescreening activities reflect applicable laws,
  executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines,
  and specific criteria established for the risk designations of assigned
  positions. Examples of personnel screening include background investigations
  and agency checks. Organizations may define different rescreening conditions
  and frequencies for personnel accessing systems based on types of information
  processed, stored, or transmitted by the systems. Related Control(s): AC-2,
  IA-4, MA-5, PE-2, PM-12, PS-2, PS-6, PS-7, SA-21.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Personnel security policy; procedures addressing
  personnel screening; records of screened personnel; system security plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with personnel security
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for personnel screening].

  organization-defined conditions requiring rescreening and, where rescreening
  is so indicated, the frequency of rescreening].

  - where rescreening is so indicated, individuals are rescreened [Assignment:
