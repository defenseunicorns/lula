control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Employ a formal sanctions process for individuals failing to comply with
  established information security and privacy policies and procedures; and

  b. Notify [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] within
  [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when a formal employee
  sanctions process is initiated, identifying the individual sanctioned and the
  reason for the sanction.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizational sanctions reflect applicable laws, executive orders,
  directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Sanctions
  processes are described in access agreements and can be included as part of
  general personnel policies for organizations and/or specified in security and
  privacy policies. Organizations consult with the Office of the General Counsel
  regarding matters of employee sanctions. Related Control(s): PL-4, PM-12,
  PS-6, PT-1.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Personnel security policy; personnel security
  procedures; procedures addressing personnel sanctions; access agreements
  (including non-disclosure agreements, acceptable use agreements, rules of
  behavior, and conflict-of-interest agreements); list of personnel or roles to
  be notified of formal employee sanctions; records or notifications of formal
  employee sanctions; system security plan; privacy plan; personally
  identifiable information processing policy; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with personnel security
  responsibilities; legal counsel; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing formal employee
  sanctions; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing formal employee sanctions
  notifications].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: PS-8.2, PS-8.3,
  PS-8.4. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because the
  following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test
  result/compliance statement: PS-8.3.


  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.
