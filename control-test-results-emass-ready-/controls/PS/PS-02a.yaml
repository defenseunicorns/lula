control-acronym: "[r5] PS-02"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Assign a risk designation to all organizational positions;

  b. Establish screening criteria for individuals filling those positions; and

  c. Review and update position risk designations [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Position risk designations reflect Office of Personnel Management (OPM) policy
  and guidance. Proper position designation is the foundation of an effective
  and consistent suitability and personnel security program. The Position
  Designation System (PDS) assesses the duties and responsibilities of a
  position to determine the degree of potential damage to the efficiency or
  integrity of the service due to misconduct of an incumbent of a position and
  establishes the risk level of that position. The PDS assessment also
  determines if the duties and responsibilities of the position present the
  potential for position incumbents to bring about a material adverse effect on
  national security and the degree of that potential effect, which establishes
  the sensitivity level of a position. The results of the assessment determine
  what level of investigation is conducted for a position. Risk designations can
  guide and inform the types of authorizations that individuals receive when
  accessing organizational information and information systems. Position
  screening criteria include explicit information security role appointment
  requirements. Parts 1400 and 731 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations,
  establish the requirements for organizations to evaluate relevant covered
  positions for a position sensitivity and position risk designation
  commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of those positions. Related

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Personnel security policy; procedures addressing
  position categorization; appropriate codes of federal regulations; list of
  risk designations for organizational positions; records of position risk
  designation reviews and updates; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with personnel security
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for assigning, reviewing, and
  updating position risk designations; organizational processes for establishing
  screening criteria].
