control-acronym: "[r5] IR-09(03)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Implement the following procedures to ensure that organizational personnel
  impacted by information spills can continue to carry out assigned tasks while
  contaminated systems are undergoing corrective actions: [Assignment:
  organization-defined procedures].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Corrective actions for systems contaminated due to information spillages may
  be time-consuming. Personnel may not have access to the contaminated systems
  while corrective actions are being taken, which may potentially affect their
  ability to conduct organizational business. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident response; procedures addressing information spillage; incident
  response plan; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident response
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for post-spill operations].
