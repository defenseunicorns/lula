  Description:

  Coordinate an incident handling capability for insider threats that includes
  the following organizational entities [Assignment: organization-defined
  entities].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Incident handling for insider threat incidents (e.g., preparation, detection
  and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery) requires coordination
  among many organizational entities, including mission or business owners,
  system owners, human resources offices, procurement offices, personnel
  offices, physical security offices, senior agency information security
  officer, operations personnel, risk executive (function), senior agency
  official for privacy, and legal counsel. In addition, organizations may
  require external support from federal, state, and local law enforcement
  agencies. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident handling; incident response plan; insider threat program plan;
  insider threat CONOPS; system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident handling
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities; organizational personnel/elements with whom the
  incident handling capability is to be coordinated].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for coordinating incident
  handling].
