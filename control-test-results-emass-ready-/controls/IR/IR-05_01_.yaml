control-information: >-
  Description:

  Track incidents and collect and analyze incident information using
  [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Automated mechanisms for tracking incidents and collecting and analyzing
  incident information include Computer Incident Response Centers or other
  electronic databases of incidents and network monitoring devices. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident monitoring; incident response records and documentation; system
  security plan; incident response plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident monitoring
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Incident monitoring capability for the organization;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the tracking and
  documenting of system security incidents].
