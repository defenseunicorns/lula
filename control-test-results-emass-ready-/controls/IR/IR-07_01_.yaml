control-acronym: "[r5] IR-07(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Increase the availability of incident response information and support using
  [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Automated mechanisms can provide a push or pull capability for users to obtain
  incident response assistance. For example, individuals may have access to a
  website to query the assistance capability, or the assistance capability can
  proactively send incident response information to users (general distribution
  or targeted) as part of increasing understanding of current response
  capabilities and support. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident response assistance; automated mechanisms supporting incident
  response support and assistance; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; incident response plan;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident response
  support and assistance responsibilities; organizational personnel with access
  to incident response support and assistance capability; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for incident response assistance;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing an increase in the
  availability of incident response information and support].
