  Description:

  Employ the following controls for personnel exposed to information not within
  assigned access authorizations: [Assignment: organization-defined controls].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Controls include ensuring that personnel who are exposed to spilled
  information are made aware of the laws, executive orders, directives,
  regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines regarding the information and
  the restrictions imposed based on exposure to such information. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident response; procedures addressing information spillage; incident
  response plan; system security plan; security safeguards regarding information
  spillage/exposure to unauthorized personnel; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident response
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for dealing with information
  exposed to unauthorized personnel; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  safeguards for personnel exposed to information not within assigned access
  authorizations].
