control-acronym: "[r5] IR-04(04)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Correlate incident information and individual incident responses to achieve an
  organization-wide perspective on incident awareness and response.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Sometimes, a threat event, such as a hostile cyber-attack, can only be
  observed by bringing together information from different sources, including
  various reports and reporting procedures established by organizations. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident handling; incident response plan; privacy plan; mechanisms supporting
  incident and event correlation; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system security plan;
  privacy plan; incident management correlation logs; event management
  correlation logs; security information and event management logs; incident
  management correlation reports; event management correlation reports; security
  information and event management reports; audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident handling
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities; organizational personnel with whom incident
  information and individual incident responses are to be correlated].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for correlating incident
  information and individual incident responses; mechanisms that support and or
  implement the correlation of incident response information with individual
  incident responses].
