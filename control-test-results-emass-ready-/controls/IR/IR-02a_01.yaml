control-acronym: "[r5] IR-02"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Provide incident response training to system users consistent with assigned
  roles and responsibilities:

  1. Within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of assuming an
  incident response role or responsibility or acquiring system access;

  2. When required by system changes; and

  3. [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] thereafter; and

  b. Review and update incident response training content [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment:
  organization-defined events].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Incident response training is associated with the assigned roles and
  responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure that the appropriate
  content and level of detail are included in such training. For example, users
  may only need to know who to call or how to recognize an incident; system
  administrators may require additional training on how to handle incidents; and
  incident responders may receive more specific training on forensics, data
  collection techniques, reporting, system recovery, and system restoration.
  Incident response training includes user training in identifying and reporting
  suspicious activities from external and internal sources. Incident response
  training for users may be provided as part of AT-2 or AT-3. Events that may
  precipitate an update to incident response training content include, but are
  not limited to, incident response plan testing or response to an actual
  incident (lessons learned), assessment or audit findings, or changes in
  applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies,
  standards, and guidelines. Related Control(s): AT-2, AT-3, AT-4, CP-3, IR-3,
  IR-4, IR-8, IR-9.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident response training; incident response training curriculum; incident
  response training materials; privacy plan; incident response plan; incident
  response training records; system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident response
  training and operational responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security and privacy responsibilities].
