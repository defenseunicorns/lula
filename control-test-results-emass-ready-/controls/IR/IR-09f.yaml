control-acronym: "[r5] IR-09"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Respond to information spills by:

  a. Assigning [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] with
  responsibility for responding to information spills;

  b. Identifying the specific information involved in the system contamination;

  c. Alerting [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] of the
  information spill using a method of communication not associated with the
  spill;

  d. Isolating the contaminated system or system component;

  e. Eradicating the information from the contaminated system or component;

  f. Identifying other systems or system components that may have been
  subsequently contaminated; and

  g. Performing the following additional actions: [Assignment:
  organization-defined actions].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information spillage refers to instances where information is placed on
  systems that are not authorized to process such information. Information
  spills occur when information that is thought to be a certain classification
  or impact level is transmitted to a system and subsequently is determined to
  be of a higher classification or impact level. At that point, corrective
  action is required. The nature of the response is based on the classification
  or impact level of the spilled information, the security capabilities of the
  system, the specific nature of the contaminated storage media, and the access
  authorizations of individuals with authorized access to the contaminated
  system. The methods used to communicate information about the spill after the
  fact do not involve methods directly associated with the actual spill to
  minimize the risk of further spreading the contamination before such
  contamination is isolated and eradicated. Related Control(s): CP-2, IR-6,
  PM-26, PM-27, PT-2, PT-3, PT-7, RA-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  information spillage; incident response plan; system security plan; records of
  information spillage alerts/notifications; list of personnel who should
  receive alerts of information spillage; list of actions to be performed
  regarding information spillage; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident response
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for information spillage
  response; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing information spillage
  response actions and related communications].
