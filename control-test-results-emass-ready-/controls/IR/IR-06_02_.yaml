control-acronym: "[r5] IR-06(02)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Report system vulnerabilities associated with reported incidents to
  [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Reported incidents that uncover system vulnerabilities are analyzed by
  organizational personnel including system owners, mission and business owners,
  senior agency information security officers, senior agency officials for
  privacy, authorizing officials, and the risk executive (function). The
  analysis can serve to prioritize and initiate mitigation actions to address
  the discovered system vulnerability. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident reporting; incident response plan; system security plan; privacy
  plan; security incident reports and associated system vulnerabilities; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident reporting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators; personnel to whom
  vulnerabilities associated with security incidents are to be reported].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for incident reporting;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the reporting of vulnerabilities
  associated with security incidents].
