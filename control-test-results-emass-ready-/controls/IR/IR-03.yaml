control-acronym: "[r5] IR-03"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Test the effectiveness of the incident response capability for the system
  [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] using the following tests:
  [Assignment: organization-defined tests].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations test incident response capabilities to determine their
  effectiveness and identify potential weaknesses or deficiencies. Incident
  response testing includes the use of checklists, walk-through or tabletop
  exercises, and simulations (parallel or full interrupt). Incident response
  testing can include a determination of the effects on organizational
  operations and assets and individuals due to incident response. The use of
  qualitative and quantitative data aids in determining the effectiveness of
  incident response processes. Related Control(s): CP-3, CP-4, IR-2, IR-4, IR-8,
  PM-14.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
