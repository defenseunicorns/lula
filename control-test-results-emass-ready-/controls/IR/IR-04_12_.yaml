control-acronym: "[r5] IR-04(12)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Analyze malicious code and/or other residual artifacts remaining in the system
  after the incident.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  When conducted carefully in an isolated environment, analysis of malicious
  code and other residual artifacts of a security incident or breach can give
  the organization insight into adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures.
  It can also indicate the identity or some defining characteristics of the
  adversary. In addition, malicious code analysis can help the organization
  develop responses to future incidents. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident handling; procedures addressing code and forensic analysis;
  procedures addressing incident response; incident response plan; system design
  documentation; malicious code protection mechanisms, tools, and techniques;
  results from malicious code analyses; system security plan; system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system; organizational
  personnel with responsibility for malicious code protection; organizational
  personnel responsible for incident response/management].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational process for incident response;
  organizational processes for conducting forensic analysis; tools and
  techniques for analysis of malicious code characteristics and behavior].
