control-information: >-
  Description:

  Track and document incidents.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Documenting incidents includes maintaining records about each incident, the
  status of the incident, and other pertinent information necessary for
  forensics as well as evaluating incident details, trends, and handling.
  Incident information can be obtained from a variety of sources, including
  network monitoring, incident reports, incident response teams, user
  complaints, supply chain partners, audit monitoring, physical access
  monitoring, and user and administrator reports. IR-4 provides information on
  the types of incidents that are appropriate for monitoring. Related
  Control(s): AU-6, AU-7, IR-4, IR-6, IR-8, PE-6, PM-5, SC-5, SC-7, SI-3, SI-4,
  SI-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident monitoring; incident response records and documentation; incident
  response plan; system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident monitoring
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Incident monitoring capability for the organization;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the tracking and documenting of
  system security incidents].
