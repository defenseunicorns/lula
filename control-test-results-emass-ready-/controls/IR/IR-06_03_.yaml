control-acronym: "[r5] IR-06(03)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Provide incident information to the provider of the product or service and
  other organizations involved in the supply chain or supply chain governance
  for systems or system components related to the incident.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations involved in supply chain activities include product developers,
  system integrators, manufacturers, packagers, assemblers, distributors,
  vendors, and resellers. Entities that provide supply chain governance include
  the Federal Acquisition Security Council (FASC). Supply chain incidents
  include compromises or breaches that involve information technology products,
  system components, development processes or personnel, distribution processes,
  or warehousing facilities. Organizations determine the appropriate information
  to share and consider the value gained from informing external organizations
  about supply chain incidents, including the ability to improve processes or to
  identify the root cause of an incident. Related Control(s): SR-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing supply
  chain coordination and supply chain risk information sharing with the Federal
  Acquisition Security Council; acquisition policy; acquisition contracts;
  service-level agreements; incident response plan; supply chain risk management
  plan; system security plan; plans of other organizations involved in supply
  chain activities; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident reporting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with supply chain risk management
  responsibilities; organization personnel with acquisition responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for incident reporting;
  organizational processes for supply chain risk information sharing; mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing the reporting of incident information involved
  in the supply chain].
