control-information: >-
  Description:

  Provide information spillage response training [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations establish requirements for responding to information spillage
  incidents in incident response plans. Incident response training on a regular
  basis helps to ensure that organizational personnel understand their
  individual responsibilities and what specific actions to take when spillage
  incidents occur. Related Control(s): AT-2, AT-3, CP-3, IR-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  information spillage response training; information spillage response training
  curriculum; information spillage response training materials; incident
  response plan; system security plan; information spillage response training
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident response
  training responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].
