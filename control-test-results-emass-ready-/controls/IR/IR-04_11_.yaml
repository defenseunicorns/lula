  Description:

  Establish and maintain an integrated incident response team that can be
  deployed to any location identified by the organization in [Assignment:
  organization-defined time period].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  An integrated incident response team is a team of experts that assesses,
  documents, and responds to incidents so that organizational systems and
  networks can recover quickly and implement the necessary controls to avoid
  future incidents. Incident response team personnel include forensic and
  malicious code analysts, tool developers, systems security and privacy
  engineers, and real-time operations personnel. The incident handling
  capability includes performing rapid forensic preservation of evidence and
  analysis of and response to intrusions. For some organizations, the incident
  response team can be a cross-organizational entity.


  An integrated incident response team facilitates information sharing and
  allows organizational personnel (e.g., developers, implementers, and
  operators) to leverage team knowledge of the threat and implement defensive
  measures that enable organizations to deter intrusions more effectively.
  Moreover, integrated teams promote the rapid detection of intrusions, the
  development of appropriate mitigations, and the deployment of effective
  defensive measures. For example, when an intrusion is detected, the integrated
  team can rapidly develop an appropriate response for operators to implement,
  correlate the new incident with information on past intrusions, and augment
  ongoing cyber intelligence development. Integrated incident response teams are
  better able to identify adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures that are
  linked to the operations tempo or specific mission and business functions and
  to define responsive actions in a way that does not disrupt those mission and
  business functions. Incident response teams can be distributed within
  organizations to make the capability resilient. Related Control(s): AT-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident handling; procedures addressing incident response planning; incident
  response plan; system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident handling
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities; members of the integrated incident response team].

  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: IR-10.1; as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements:
  CCI-004143, CCI-004144. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally
  entered test result/compliance statement: IR-10.1. The resulting compliance
  status was set to non-compliant because of the addition of a new security
  requirement to the assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed:
  CCI-004143, CCI-004144."
