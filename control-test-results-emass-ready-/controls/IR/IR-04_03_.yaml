control-acronym: "[r5] IR-04(03)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Identify [Assignment: organization-defined classes of incidents] and take the
  following actions in response to those incidents to ensure continuation of
  organizational mission and business functions: [Assignment:
  organization-defined actions to take in response to classes of incidents].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Classes of incidents include malfunctions due to design or implementation
  errors and omissions, targeted malicious attacks, and untargeted malicious
  attacks. Incident response actions include orderly system degradation, system
  shutdown, fall back to manual mode or activation of alternative technology
  whereby the system operates differently, employing deceptive measures,
  alternate information flows, or operating in a mode that is reserved for when
  systems are under attack. Organizations consider whether continuity of
  operations requirements during an incident conflict with the capability to
  automatically disable the system as specified as part of IR-4(5). Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident handling; incident response plan; privacy plan; list of classes of
  incidents; list of appropriate incident response actions; system security
  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident handling
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms that support and/or implement continuity of
  operations].
