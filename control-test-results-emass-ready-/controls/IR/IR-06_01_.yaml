control-information: >-
  Description:

  Report incidents using [Assignment: organization-defined automated
  mechanisms].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The recipients of incident reports are specified in IR-6b. Automated reporting
  mechanisms include email, posting on websites (with automatic updates), and
  automated incident response tools and programs. Related Control(s): IR-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident reporting; automated mechanisms supporting incident reporting; system
  design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; incident response plan; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident reporting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for incident reporting; automated
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the reporting of security
  incidents].
