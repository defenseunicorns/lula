  Description:

  Establish and maintain a security operations center.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A security operations center (SOC) is the focal point for security operations
  and computer network defense for an organization. The purpose of the SOC is to
  defend and monitor an organizationâ€™s systems and networks (i.e., cyber
  infrastructure) on an ongoing basis. The SOC is also responsible for
  detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity incidents in a timely
  manner. The organization staffs the SOC with skilled technical and operational
  personnel (e.g., security analysts, incident response personnel, systems
  security engineers) and implements a combination of technical, management, and
  operational controls (including monitoring, scanning, and forensics tools) to
  monitor, fuse, correlate, analyze, and respond to threat and security-relevant
  event data from multiple sources. These sources include perimeter defenses,
  network devices (e.g., routers, switches), and endpoint agent data feeds. The
  SOC provides a holistic situational awareness capability to help organizations
  determine the security posture of the system and organization. A SOC
  capability can be obtained in a variety of ways. Larger organizations may
  implement a dedicated SOC while smaller organizations may employ third-party
  organizations to provide such a capability. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; contingency planning policy;
  procedures addressing incident handling; procedures addressing the security
  operations center operations; mechanisms supporting dynamic response
  capabilities; incident response plan; contingency plan; system security plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident handling
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with contingency planning
  responsibilities; security operations center personnel; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms that support and/or implement the security
  operations center capability; mechanisms that support and/or implement the
  incident handling process].
