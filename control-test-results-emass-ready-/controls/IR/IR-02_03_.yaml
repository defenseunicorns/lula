  Description:

  Provide incident response training on how to identify and respond to a breach,
  including the organizationâ€™s process for reporting a breach.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  For federal agencies, an incident that involves personally identifiable
  information is considered a breach. A breach results in the loss of control,
  compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or a similar
  occurrence where a person other than an authorized user accesses or
  potentially accesses personally identifiable information or an authorized user
  accesses or potentially accesses such information for other than authorized
  purposes. The incident response training emphasizes the obligation of
  individuals to report both confirmed and suspected breaches involving
  information in any medium or form, including paper, oral, and electronic.
  Incident response training includes tabletop exercises that simulate a breach.
  See IR-2(1). Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
