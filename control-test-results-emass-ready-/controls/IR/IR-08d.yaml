  Description:

  a. Develop an incident response plan that:

  1. Provides the organization with a roadmap for implementing its incident
  response capability;

  2. Describes the structure and organization of the incident response
  capability;

  3. Provides a high-level approach for how the incident response capability
  fits into the overall organization;

  4. Meets the unique requirements of the organization, which relate to mission,
  size, structure, and functions;

  5. Defines reportable incidents;

  6. Provides metrics for measuring the incident response capability within the
  organization;

  7. Defines the resources and management support needed to effectively maintain
  and mature an incident response capability;

  8. Addresses the sharing of incident information;

  9. Is reviewed and approved by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
  roles] [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and

  10. Explicitly designates responsibility for incident response to [Assignment:
  organization-defined entities, personnel, or roles].

  b. Distribute copies of the incident response plan to [Assignment:
  organization-defined incident response personnel (identified by name and/or by
  role) and organizational elements];

  c. Update the incident response plan to address system and organizational
  changes or problems encountered during plan implementation, execution, or
  testing;

  d. Communicate incident response plan changes to [Assignment:
  organization-defined incident response personnel (identified by name and/or by
  role) and organizational elements]; and

  e. Protect the incident response plan from unauthorized disclosure and
  modification.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  It is important that organizations develop and implement a coordinated
  approach to incident response. Organizational mission and business functions
  determine the structure of incident response capabilities. As part of the
  incident response capabilities, organizations consider the coordination and
  sharing of information with external organizations, including external service
  providers and other organizations involved in the supply chain. For incidents
  involving personally identifiable information (i.e., breaches), include a
  process to determine whether notice to oversight organizations or affected
  individuals is appropriate and provide that notice accordingly. Related

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident response planning; incident response plan; system security plan;
  privacy plan; records of incident response plan reviews and approvals; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident response
  planning responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational incident response plan and related
  organizational processes].
