  Description:

  a. Require personnel to report suspected incidents to the organizational
  incident response capability within [Assignment: organization-defined time
  period]; and

  b. Report incident information to [Assignment: organization-defined
  authorities].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The types of incidents reported, the content and timeliness of the reports,
  and the designated reporting authorities reflect applicable laws, executive
  orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Incident
  information can inform risk assessments, control effectiveness assessments,
  security requirements for acquisitions, and selection criteria for technology
  products. Related Control(s): CM-6, CP-2, IR-4, IR-5, IR-8, IR-9.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident reporting; incident reporting records and documentation; incident
  response plan; system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident reporting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities; personnel who have/should have reported incidents;
  personnel (authorities) to whom incident information is to be reported; system
  users].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for incident reporting;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing incident reporting].
