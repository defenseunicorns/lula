control-acronym: "[r5] IR-04"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Implement an incident handling capability for incidents that is consistent
  with the incident response plan and includes preparation, detection and
  analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery;

  b. Coordinate incident handling activities with contingency planning
  activities;

  c. Incorporate lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into
  incident response procedures, training, and testing, and implement the
  resulting changes accordingly; and

  d. Ensure the rigor, intensity, scope, and results of incident handling
  activities are comparable and predictable across the organization.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations recognize that incident response capabilities are dependent on
  the capabilities of organizational systems and the mission and business
  processes being supported by those systems. Organizations consider incident
  response as part of the definition, design, and development of mission and
  business processes and systems. Incident-related information can be obtained
  from a variety of sources, including audit monitoring, physical access
  monitoring, and network monitoring; user or administrator reports; and
  reported supply chain events. An effective incident handling capability
  includes coordination among many organizational entities (e.g., mission or
  business owners, system owners, authorizing officials, human resources
  offices, physical security offices, personnel security offices, legal
  departments, risk executive [function], operations personnel, procurement
  offices). Suspected security incidents include the receipt of suspicious email
  communications that can contain malicious code. Suspected supply chain
  incidents include the insertion of counterfeit hardware or malicious code into
  organizational systems or system components. For federal agencies, an incident
  that involves personally identifiable information is considered a breach. A
  breach results in unauthorized disclosure, the loss of control, unauthorized
  acquisition, compromise, or a similar occurrence where a person other than an
  authorized user accesses or potentially accesses personally identifiable
  information or an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses such
  information for other than authorized purposes. Related Control(s): AC-19,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
