control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Establish a direct, cooperative relationship between its incident response
  capability and external providers of system protection capability; and

  (b) Identify organizational incident response team members to the external
  providers.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  External providers of a system protection capability include the Computer
  Network Defense program within the U.S. Department of Defense. External
  providers help to protect, monitor, analyze, detect, and respond to
  unauthorized activity within organizational information systems and networks.
  It may be beneficial to have agreements in place with external providers to
  clarify the roles and responsibilities of each party before an incident
  occurs. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident response assistance; incident response plan; system security plan;
  privacy plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident response
  support and assistance responsibilities; external providers of system
  protection capability; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities].
