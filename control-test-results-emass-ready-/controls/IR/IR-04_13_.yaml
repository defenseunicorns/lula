  Description:

  Analyze anomalous or suspected adversarial behavior in or related to
  [Assignment: organization-defined environments or resources].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  If the organization maintains a deception environment, an analysis of
  behaviors in that environment, including resources targeted by the adversary
  and timing of the incident or event, can provide insight into adversarial
  tactics, techniques, and procedures. External to a deception environment, the
  analysis of anomalous adversarial behavior (e.g., changes in system
  performance or usage patterns) or suspected behavior (e.g., changes in
  searches for the location of specific resources) can give the organization
  such insight. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing system
  monitoring tools and techniques; incident response plan; system monitoring
  logs or records; system monitoring tools and techniques documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; security plan; system
  component inventory; network diagram; system protocols documentation; list of
  acceptable thresholds for false positives and false negatives; system security
  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for detecting anomalous
  behavior].
