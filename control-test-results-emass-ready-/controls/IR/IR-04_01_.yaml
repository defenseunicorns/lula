control-information: >-
  Description:

  Support the incident handling process using [Assignment: organization-defined
  automated mechanisms].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Automated mechanisms that support incident handling processes include online
  incident management systems and tools that support the collection of live
  response data, full network packet capture, and forensic analysis. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident handling; automated mechanisms supporting incident handling; system
  design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system audit records; incident response plan; system security
  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident handling
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms that support and/or implement the
  incident handling process].
