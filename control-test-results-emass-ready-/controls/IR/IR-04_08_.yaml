control-information: >-
  Description:

  Coordinate with [Assignment: organization-defined external organizations] to
  correlate and share [Assignment: organization-defined incident information] to
  achieve a cross-organization perspective on incident awareness and more
  effective incident responses.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The coordination of incident information with external organizations—including
  mission or business partners, military or coalition partners, customers, and
  developers—can provide significant benefits. Cross-organizational coordination
  can serve as an important risk management capability. This capability allows
  organizations to leverage information from a variety of sources to effectively
  respond to incidents and breaches that could potentially affect the
  organization’s operations, assets, and individuals. Related Control(s): AU-16,
  PM-16.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident handling; list of external organizations; records of incident
  handling coordination with external organizations; incident response plan;
  system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident handling
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities; personnel from external organizations with whom
  incident response information is to be coordinated, shared, and correlated].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for coordinating incident
  handling information with external organizations].
