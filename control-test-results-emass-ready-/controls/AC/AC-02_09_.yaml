control-information: >-
  Description:

  Only permit the use of shared and group accounts that meet [Assignment:
  organization-defined conditions for establishing shared and group accounts].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Before permitting the use of shared or group accounts, organizations consider
  the increased risk due to the lack of accountability with such accounts.
  Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; system-generated list of shared/group accounts and
  associated roles; system audit records; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing management of shared/group
  accounts].
