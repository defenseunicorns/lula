control-acronym: "[r5] AC-16(06)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Require personnel to associate and maintain the association of [Assignment:
  organization-defined security and privacy attributes] with [Assignment:
  organization-defined subjects and objects] in accordance with [Assignment:
  organization-defined security and privacy policies].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Maintaining attribute association requires individual users (as opposed to the
  system) to maintain associations of defined security and privacy attributes
  with subjects and objects. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing
  association of security and privacy attributes with subjects and objects;
  system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  associating and maintaining association of security and privacy attributes
  with subjects and objects; organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting associations of security and privacy
  attributes to subjects and objects].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: AC-16(6).1,
  AC-16(6).2, AC-16(6).3, AC-16(6).4, AC-16(6).5, AC-16(6).6, AC-16(6).7,
  AC-16(6).8; as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-003730,
  CCI-003731, CCI-003732, CCI-003733, CCI-003734, CCI-003735, CCI-003736,
  CCI-003737. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test
  result/compliance statement: AC-16(6).1, AC-16(6).2, AC-16(6).3, AC-16(6).4,
  AC-16(6).5, AC-16(6).6, AC-16(6).7, AC-16(6).8. The resulting compliance
  status was set to non-compliant because of the addition of a new security
  requirement to the assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed:
  CCI-003730, CCI-003731, CCI-003732, CCI-003733, CCI-003734, CCI-003735,
  CCI-003736, CCI-003737.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS inherently supports the
  association and management of security attributes for stored, processed, and
  transmitted information through integrated infrastructure capabilities.
  However, explicitly displaying security attributes in human-readable form such
  as special dissemination, handling, or distribution instructionsâ€”on output
  devices is typically managed at the application or client endpoint layer,
  rather than within the UDS platform itself.)

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS enables dynamic association and
  enforcement of organizationally defined security attributes (e.g., sensitivity
  levels, classification labels, and handling instructions) with subjects and
  objects. However, explicitly defining, documenting, and enforcing the specific
  security policies that personnel must follow when assigning and managing these
  attributes remains an organizational administrative responsibility.)
