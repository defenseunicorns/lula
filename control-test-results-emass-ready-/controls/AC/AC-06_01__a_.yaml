control-acronym: "[r5] AC-06(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Authorize access for [Assignment: organization-defined individuals or roles]
  to:

  (a) [Assignment: organization-defined security functions (deployed in
  hardware, software, and firmware)]; and

  (b) [Assignment: organization-defined security-relevant information].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Security functions include establishing system accounts, configuring access
  authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), configuring settings for
  events to be audited, and establishing intrusion detection parameters.
  Security-relevant information includes filtering rules for routers or
  firewalls, configuration parameters for security services, cryptographic key
  management information, and access control lists. Authorized personnel include
  security administrators, system administrators, system security officers,
  system programmers, and other privileged users. Related Control(s): AC-17,
  AC-18, AC-19, AU-9, PE-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing least
  privilege; list of security functions (deployed in hardware, software, and
  firmware) and security-relevant information for which access must be
  explicitly authorized; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system audit records; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  defining least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing least privilege functions].

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.

  The UDS stack enforces this by requiring that any change to permissions (like
  adding a user to an admin role in Keycloak or granting a cluster role in
  Kubernetes) be performed by an account that already has administrative rights.
  This means privileged functions – e.g., managing security settings, creating
  accounts, modifying critical configurations – are inaccessible to general
  users. The stack’s design (central admin console for Keycloak, controlled
  cluster config via IaC) ensures that granting or adjusting privileges is
  itself a restricted action.
rev-4-migration-notes: "Automatically generated test result during Revision 5
  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: AC-6(1).1, AC-6(1).3; as well as the following Rev. 5 security
  requirements: CCI-003685. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because of the addition of a new security requirement to the
  assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed: CCI-003685."
