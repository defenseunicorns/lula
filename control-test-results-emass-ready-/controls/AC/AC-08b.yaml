control-acronym: "[r5] AC-08"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Display [Assignment: organization-defined system use notification message
  or banner] to users before granting access to the system that provides privacy
  and security notices consistent with applicable laws, executive orders,
  directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines and state that:

  1. Users are accessing a U.S. Government system;

  2. System usage may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit;

  3. Unauthorized use of the system is prohibited and subject to criminal and
  civil penalties; and

  4. Use of the system indicates consent to monitoring and recording;

  b. Retain the notification message or banner on the screen until users
  acknowledge the usage conditions and take explicit actions to log on to or
  further access the system; and

  c. For publicly accessible systems:

  1. Display system use information [Assignment: organization-defined
  conditions], before granting further access to the publicly accessible system;

  2. Display references, if any, to monitoring, recording, or auditing that are
  consistent with privacy accommodations for such systems that generally
  prohibit those activities; and

  3. Include a description of the authorized uses of the system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  System use notifications can be implemented using messages or warning banners
  displayed before individuals log in to systems. System use notifications are
  used only for access via logon interfaces with human users. Notifications are
  not required when human interfaces do not exist. Based on an assessment of
  risk, organizations consider whether or not a secondary system use
  notification is needed to access applications or other system resources after
  the initial network logon. Organizations consider system use notification
  messages or banners displayed in multiple languages based on organizational
  needs and the demographics of system users. Organizations consult with the
  privacy office for input regarding privacy messaging and the Office of the
  General Counsel or organizational equivalent for legal review and approval of
  warning banner content. Related Control(s): AC-14, PL-4, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; privacy and security policies,
  procedures addressing system use notification; documented approval of system
  use notification messages or banners; system audit records; user
  acknowledgements of notification message or banner; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system use notification messages; system security plan; privacy plan; privacy
  impact assessment; privacy assessment report; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities; legal
  counsel; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing system use notification].
