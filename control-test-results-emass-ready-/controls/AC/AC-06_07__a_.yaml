control-acronym: "[r5] AC-06(07)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Review [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] the privileges
  assigned to [Assignment: organization-defined roles or classes of users] to
  validate the need for such privileges; and

  (b) Reassign or remove privileges, if necessary, to correctly reflect
  organizational mission and business needs.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The need for certain assigned user privileges may change over time to reflect
  changes in organizational mission and business functions, environments of
  operation, technologies, or threats. A periodic review of assigned user
  privileges is necessary to determine if the rationale for assigning such
  privileges remains valid. If the need cannot be revalidated, organizations
  take appropriate corrective actions. Related Control(s): CA-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing least
  privilege; list of system-generated roles or classes of users and assigned
  privileges; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; validation reviews of privileges assigned to roles
  or classes or users; records of privilege removals or reassignments for roles
  or classes of users; system audit records; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  reviewing least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing review of user privileges].

  the privileges assigned to organization-defined roles or classes of users.;
  002229: Defines the roles or classes of users that are to have their
  privileges reviewed on an organization-defined frequency.; 002230: Review, on
  an organization-defined frequency, the privileges assigned to
  organization-defined roles or classes of users to validate the need for such
  privileges."
implementation-guidance: CCI-002228 and CCI-002229 of this assessment procedure
  are automatically compliant because of coverage by DoD Enterprise.

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: AC-6(7).1,
  AC-6(7).2, AC-6(7).3. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant
  because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test
  result/compliance statement: AC-6(7).3.


  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.

  UDS does provide audit logs for privileged actions: Keycloak records admin
  events (any change to realms, clients, roles, users by an admin), and
  Kubernetes can log actions taken by cluster admins (if audit logging is
  enabled). Those logs can be reviewed to detect if privileged functions are
  being abused or used outside of procedures.
