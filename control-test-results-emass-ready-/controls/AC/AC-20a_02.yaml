control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. [Selection (one or more): Establish [Assignment: organization-defined terms
  and conditions]; Identify [Assignment: organization-defined controls asserted
  to be implemented on external systems]], consistent with the trust
  relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or
  maintaining external systems, allowing authorized individuals to:

  1. Access the system from external systems; and

  2. Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using
  external systems; or

  b. Prohibit the use of [Assignment: organizationally-defined types of external
  systems].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  External systems are systems that are used by but not part of organizational
  systems, and for which the organization has no direct control over the
  implementation of required controls or the assessment of control
  effectiveness. External systems include personally owned systems, components,
  or devices; privately owned computing and communications devices in commercial
  or public facilities; systems owned or controlled by nonfederal organizations;
  systems managed by contractors; and federal information systems that are not
  owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision or authority of the
  organization. External systems also include systems owned or operated by other
  components within the same organization and systems within the organization
  with different authorization boundaries. Organizations have the option to
  prohibit the use of any type of external system or prohibit the use of
  specified types of external systems, (e.g., prohibit the use of any external
  system that is not organizationally owned or prohibit the use of
  personally-owned systems).


  For some external systems (i.e., systems operated by other organizations), the
  trust relationships that have been established between those organizations and
  the originating organization may be such that no explicit terms and conditions
  are required. Systems within these organizations may not be considered
  external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing
  information exchange agreements (either implicit or explicit) established
  between organizations or components or when such agreements are specified by
  applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, or
  standards. Authorized individuals include organizational personnel,
  contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational
  systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose specific
  rules of behavior regarding system access. Restrictions that organizations
  impose on authorized individuals need not be uniform, as the restrictions may
  vary depending on trust relationships between organizations. Therefore,
  organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on
  contractors than on state, local, or tribal governments.


  External systems used to access public interfaces to organizational systems
  are outside the scope of AC-20. Organizations establish specific terms and
  conditions for the use of external systems in accordance with organizational
  security policies and procedures. At a minimum, terms and conditions address
  the specific types of applications that can be accessed on organizational
  systems from external systems and the highest security category of information
  that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external systems. If the
  terms and conditions with the owners of the external systems cannot be
  established, organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel
  using those external systems. Related Control(s): AC-2, AC-3, AC-17, AC-19,
  CA-3, PL-2, PL-4, SA-9, SC-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing the use of
  external systems; external systems terms and conditions; list of types of
  applications accessible from external systems; maximum security categorization
  for information processed, stored, or transmitted on external systems; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system security plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  defining terms and conditions for use of external systems to access
  organizational systems; system/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing terms and conditions on the use of
  external systems].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: AC-20.2; as well
  as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-003752, CCI-003753. The
  resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following
  Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance
  statement: AC-20.2. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant
  because of the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment
  procedure that has not been previously assessed: CCI-003752, CCI-003753.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (An MOU/MOA must be written according
  to the organizational requirements and is handled outside of the system though
  technical access can be enforced by UDS.)
