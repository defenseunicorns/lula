  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information is represented internally within systems using abstractions known
  as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of
  entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects,
  are typically associated with individuals, devices, or processes acting on
  behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are typically
  associated with data structures, such as records, buffers, tables, files,
  inter-process pipes, and communications ports. Security attributes, a form of
  metadata, are abstractions that represent the basic properties or
  characteristics of active and passive entities with respect to safeguarding
  information. Privacy attributes, which may be used independently or in
  conjunction with security attributes, represent the basic properties or
  characteristics of active or passive entities with respect to the management
  of personally identifiable information. Attributes can be either explicitly or
  implicitly associated with the information contained in organizational systems
  or system components.


  Attributes may be associated with active entities (i.e., subjects) that have
  the potential to send or receive information, cause information to flow among
  objects, or change the system state. These attributes may also be associated
  with passive entities (i.e., objects) that contain or receive information. The
  association of attributes to subjects and objects by a system is referred to
  as binding and is inclusive of setting the attribute value and the attribute
  type. Attributes, when bound to data or information, permit the enforcement of
  security and privacy policies for access control and information flow control,
  including data retention limits, permitted uses of personally identifiable
  information, and identification of personal information within data objects.
  Such enforcement occurs through organizational processes or system functions
  or mechanisms. The binding techniques implemented by systems affect the
  strength of attribute binding to information. Binding strength and the
  assurance associated with binding techniques play important parts in the trust
  that organizations have in the information flow enforcement process. The
  binding techniques affect the number and degree of additional reviews required
  by organizations. The content or assigned values of attributes can directly
  affect the ability of individuals to access organizational information.


  Organizations can define the types of attributes needed for systems to support
  missions or business functions. There are many values that can be assigned to
  a security attribute. By specifying the permitted attribute ranges and values,
  organizations ensure that attribute values are meaningful and relevant.
  Labeling refers to the association of attributes with the subjects and objects
  represented by the internal data structures within systems. This facilitates
  system-based enforcement of information security and privacy policies. Labels
  include classification of information in accordance with legal and compliance
  requirements (e.g., top secret, secret, confidential, controlled
  unclassified), information impact level; high value asset information, access
  authorizations, nationality; data life cycle protection (i.e., encryption and
  data expiration), personally identifiable information processing permissions,
  including individual consent to personally identifiable information
  processing, and contractor affiliation. A related term to labeling is marking.
  Marking refers to the association of attributes with objects in a
  human-readable form and displayed on system media. Marking enables manual,
  procedural, or process-based enforcement of information security and privacy
  policies. Security and privacy labels may have the same value as media
  markings (e.g., top secret, secret, confidential). See MP-3 (Media Marking).

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing the
  association of security and privacy attributes to information in storage, in
  process, and in transmission; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit records;
  system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities; system
  developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational capability supporting and maintaining the
  association of security and privacy attributes to information in storage, in
  process, and in transmission].

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (While UDS technically facilitates
  strong enforcement and dynamic protection based on these attributes, the
  precise definitions and assignment of attribute values must be formally
  documented and maintained within organizational security documentation or
  policy.)

  UDS inherently supports defining and managing security attributes associated
  with stored information through its infrastructure and security management
  components. Specifically, UDS leverages Kubernetes and Istio Service Mesh to
  define and enforce attribute-based access controls (ABAC) using labels, tags,
  and metadata that explicitly categorize stored data and containerized
  applications.

  UDS provides effective mechanisms to associate and enforce organizationally
  defined security attributes with information in process through its
  infrastructure components and integrated security management tools.
  Specifically, the Istio Service Mesh and Kubernetes enable dynamic application
  and enforcement of security attributes using labels, annotations, and metadata
  to associate security attributes such as data classification levels or
  sensitivity labels with running processes, microservices, and workloads. 

  UDS provides robust technical capabilities to associate organizationally
  defined security attributes with information in transmission via its
  integrated Istio Service Mesh. Istio supports attribute-based access control
  (ABAC), enabling the use of metadata, labels, and annotations to enforce
  security attributes dynamically on network traffic between microservices. This
  includes attributes such as data sensitivity levels, classification labels, or
  other organizationally defined security values.
