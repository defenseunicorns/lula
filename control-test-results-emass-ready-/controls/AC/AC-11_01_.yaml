control-acronym: "[r5] AC-11(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Conceal, via the device lock, information previously visible on the display
  with a publicly viewable image.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The pattern-hiding display can include static or dynamic images, such as
  patterns used with screen savers, photographic images, solid colors, clock,
  battery life indicator, or a blank screen with the caveat that controlled
  unclassified information is not displayed. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing session
  lock; display screen with session lock activated; system design documentation;
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; system security
  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: System session lock mechanisms].

compliance-status: Not Applicable
test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (By default, Keycloak
  doesn't automatically change the user's screen when a session expires due to
  inactivity. Instead, the current page remains displayed, and the session
  timeout occurs silently on the server side. Only when the user attempts
  another interaction, like navigating or submitting a form, will the session
  expiration become apparent, prompting a redirect to Keycloak's login screen
  for reauthentication. To proactively handle this, applications can implement
  custom logic, such as client-side timers or periodic background checks, to
  detect inactivity and prompt the user accordingly, but this behavior isn't
  provided automatically by Keycloak.)
