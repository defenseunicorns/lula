control-acronym: "[r5] AC-06(09)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Log the execution of privileged functions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by
  authorized users or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised
  system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant
  adverse impacts on organizations. Logging and analyzing the use of privileged
  functions is one way to detect such misuse and, in doing so, help mitigate the
  risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat. Related
  Control(s): AU-2, AU-3, AU-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing least
  privilege; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; list of privileged functions to be audited; list of
  audited events; system audit records; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  reviewing least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms auditing the execution of least privilege
  functions].

test-results: The UDS information system audits the execution of privileged
  functions to detect and mitigate the risk of misuse by authorized users or
  unauthorized external entities. UDS employs Vector for log shipping and Loki
  for log aggregation, which enables the collection and centralization of audit
  logs. These logs can be sent to a Security Information and Event Management
  (SIEM) system for comprehensive auditing and alerting, depending on the
  customer's setup. This configuration ensures that all privileged functions are
  monitored, and any misuse can be promptly detected and addressed. The auditing
  process includes reviewing access control policies, procedures addressing
  least privilege, and maintaining detailed records of privileged functions and
  audited events. This approach helps mitigate the risk from insider threats and
  advanced persistent threats (APT), ensuring compliance with the control
  requirements.
