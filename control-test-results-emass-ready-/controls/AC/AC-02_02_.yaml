control-information: >-
  Description:

  Automatically [Selection: remove; disable] temporary and emergency accounts
  after [Assignment: organization-defined time period for each type of account].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Management of temporary and emergency accounts includes the removal or
  disabling of such accounts automatically after a predefined time period rather
  than at the convenience of the system administrator. Automatic removal or
  disabling of accounts provides a more consistent implementation. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures for addressing
  account management; system design documentation; system configuration settings
  and associated documentation; system-generated list of temporary accounts
  removed and/or disabled; system-generated list of emergency accounts removed
  and/or disabled; system audit records; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security with information security responsibilities; system
  developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms for implementing account management
  functions].

  This enhancement requires automatically disabling or removing temporary or
  emergency accounts after a defined period. The UDS stack allows creation of
  temporary accounts (e.g., a Keycloak user account for a guest or emergency
  access) and those accounts can be given an expiration date by an admin which
  then mark them disabled. This can be done in Keycloak by creating a custom
  attribute with the 72 hour expiration value or done via the Keycloak Admin API
  using a JSON file that contains the custom attribute. Following security best
  practices it is typically not recommended to use temporary accounts.

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.
