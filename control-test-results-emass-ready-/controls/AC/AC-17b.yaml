control-acronym: "[r5] AC-17"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Establish and document usage restrictions, configuration/connection
  requirements, and implementation guidance for each type of remote access
  allowed; and

  b. Authorize each type of remote access to the system prior to allowing such
  connections.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Remote access is access to organizational systems (or processes acting on
  behalf of users) that communicate through external networks such as the
  Internet. Types of remote access include dial-up, broadband, and wireless.
  Organizations use encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance
  confidentiality and integrity for remote connections. The use of encrypted
  VPNs provides sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively
  treat such connections as internal networks if the cryptographic mechanisms
  used are implemented in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders,
  directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Still, VPN
  connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance
  the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can also
  affect the ability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for
  malicious code. Remote access controls apply to systems other than public web
  servers or systems designed for public access. Authorization of each remote
  access type addresses authorization prior to allowing remote access without
  specifying the specific formats for such authorization. While organizations
  may use information exchange and system connection security agreements to
  manage remote access connections to other systems, such agreements are
  addressed as part of CA-3. Enforcing access restrictions for remote access is
  addressed via AC-3. Related Control(s): AC-2, AC-3, AC-4, AC-18, AC-19, AC-20,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing remote
  access implementation and usage (including restrictions); configuration
  management plan; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  remote access authorizations; system audit records; system security plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  managing remote access connections; system/network administrators;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Remote access management capability for the system].
