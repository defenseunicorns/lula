control-information: >-
  Description:

  Protect wireless access to the system using authentication of [Selection (one
  or more): users; devices] and encryption.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Wireless networking capabilities represent a significant potential
  vulnerability that can be exploited by adversaries. To protect systems with
  wireless access points, strong authentication of users and devices along with
  strong encryption can reduce susceptibility to threats by adversaries
  involving wireless technologies. Related Control(s): SC-8, SC-12, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing wireless
  implementation and usage (including restrictions); system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing wireless access protections to the
  system].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: AC-18(1).1,
  AC-18(1).2. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test
  result/compliance statement: AC-18(1).1, AC-18(1).2.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS does not inherently control the
  use of wireless networking. Any wireless access control would be handled by
  the underlying network infrastructure, not by UDS itself i.e. wireless network
  adapters and bluetooth would be enabled/disabled at the operating system.)
