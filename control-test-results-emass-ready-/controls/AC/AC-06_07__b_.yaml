control-acronym: "[r5] AC-06(07)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Review [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] the privileges
  assigned to [Assignment: organization-defined roles or classes of users] to
  validate the need for such privileges; and

  (b) Reassign or remove privileges, if necessary, to correctly reflect
  organizational mission and business needs.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The need for certain assigned user privileges may change over time to reflect
  changes in organizational mission and business functions, environments of
  operation, technologies, or threats. A periodic review of assigned user
  privileges is necessary to determine if the rationale for assigning such
  privileges remains valid. If the need cannot be revalidated, organizations
  take appropriate corrective actions. Related Control(s): CA-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing least
  privilege; list of system-generated roles or classes of users and assigned
  privileges; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; validation reviews of privileges assigned to roles
  or classes or users; records of privilege removals or reassignments for roles
  or classes of users; system audit records; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  reviewing least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing review of user privileges].
