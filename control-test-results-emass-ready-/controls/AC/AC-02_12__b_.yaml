control-acronym: "[r5] AC-02(12)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Monitor system accounts for [Assignment: organization-defined atypical
  usage]; and

  (b) Report atypical usage of system accounts to [Assignment:
  organization-defined personnel or roles].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Atypical usage includes accessing systems at certain times of the day or from
  locations that are not consistent with the normal usage patterns of
  individuals. Monitoring for atypical usage may reveal rogue behavior by
  individuals or an attack in progress. Account monitoring may inadvertently
  create privacy risks since data collected to identify atypical usage may
  reveal previously unknown information about the behavior of individuals.
  Organizations assess and document privacy risks from monitoring accounts for
  atypical usage in their privacy impact assessment and make determinations that
  are in alignment with their privacy program plan. Related Control(s): AU-6,
  AU-7, CA-7, IR-8, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; system monitoring records; system audit records;
  audit tracking and monitoring reports; privacy impact assessment; system
  security plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing account management functions].

  Not applicable to UDS technology stack. (It should be an organizational
  decision on how to report atypical usage for the monitored system though UDS
  provides the monitoring capabilities and audit trail.)
