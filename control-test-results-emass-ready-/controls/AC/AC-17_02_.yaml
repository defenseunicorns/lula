control-information: >-
  Description:

  Implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and
  integrity of remote access sessions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Virtual private networks can be used to protect the confidentiality and
  integrity of remote access sessions. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is an
  example of a cryptographic protocol that provides end-to-end communications
  security over networks and is used for Internet communications and online
  transactions. Related Control(s): SC-8, SC-12, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing remote
  access to the system; system design documentation; system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; cryptographic mechanisms and associated
  configuration documentation; system audit records; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Cryptographic mechanisms protecting confidentiality and
  integrity of remote access sessions].
