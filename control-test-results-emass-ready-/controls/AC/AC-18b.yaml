control-acronym: "[r5] AC-18"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Establish configuration requirements, connection requirements, and
  implementation guidance for each type of wireless access; and

  b. Authorize each type of wireless access to the system prior to allowing such
  connections.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Wireless technologies include microwave, packet radio (ultra-high frequency or
  very high frequency), 802.11x, and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use
  authentication protocols that provide authenticator protection and mutual
  authentication. Related Control(s): AC-2, AC-3, AC-17, AC-19, CA-9, CM-7,
  IA-2, IA-3, IA-8, PL-4, SC-40, SC-43, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing wireless
  access implementation and usage (including restrictions); configuration
  management plan; system design documentation; system configuration settings
  and associated documentation; wireless access authorizations; system audit
  records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  managing wireless access connections; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Wireless access management capability for the system].

  pertains to use of wireless networks, which is outside the scope of a
  container platform stack. UDS runs on underlying infrastructure that could be
  on wired networks or cloud; any wireless networking controls would be handled
  by the environment, not UDS itself.)
