control-acronym: "[r5] AC-11"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Prevent further access to the system by [Selection (one or more):
  initiating a device lock after [Assignment: organization-defined time period]
  of inactivity; requiring the user to initiate a device lock before leaving the
  system unattended]; and

  b. Retain the device lock until the user reestablishes access using
  established identification and authentication procedures.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Device locks are temporary actions taken to prevent logical access to
  organizational systems when users stop work and move away from the immediate
  vicinity of those systems but do not want to log out because of the temporary
  nature of their absences. Device locks can be implemented at the operating
  system level or at the application level. A proximity lock may be used to
  initiate the device lock (e.g., via a Bluetooth-enabled device or dongle).
  User-initiated device locking is behavior or policy-based and, as such,
  requires users to take physical action to initiate the device lock. Device
  locks are not an acceptable substitute for logging out of systems, such as
  when organizations require users to log out at the end of workdays. Related

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing session
  lock; procedures addressing identification and authentication; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  security plan; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing access control policy for session
  lock].

test-results: In UDS, when a session becomes locked either due to inactivity or
  manual user action the system retains the session lock until the user
  successfully reestablishes access using the established identification and
  authentication procedures. For example, once a session lock is triggered, any
  attempt to interact with the system will prompt the user to log in again via
  Keycloak, which may also enforce multi-factor authentication as configured.
  This process ensures that even if a session is left unattended, unauthorized
  access is prevented until valid credentials are provided. Additionally, all
  lock and reauthentication events are logged for auditing and compliance
  purposes, reinforcing the security and integrity of the session management
  process
