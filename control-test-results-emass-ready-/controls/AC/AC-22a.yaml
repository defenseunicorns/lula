control-acronym: "[r5] AC-22"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Designate individuals authorized to make information publicly accessible;

  b. Train authorized individuals to ensure that publicly accessible information
  does not contain nonpublic information;

  c. Review the proposed content of information prior to posting onto the
  publicly accessible system to ensure that nonpublic information is not
  included; and

  d. Review the content on the publicly accessible system for nonpublic
  information [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and remove such
  information, if discovered.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  In accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies,
  regulations, standards, and guidelines, the public is not authorized to have
  access to nonpublic information, including information protected under the
  PRIVACT and proprietary information. Publicly accessible content addresses
  systems that are controlled by the organization and accessible to the public,
  typically without identification or authentication. Posting information on
  non-organizational systems (e.g., non-organizational public websites, forums,
  and social media) is covered by organizational policy. While organizations may
  have individuals who are responsible for developing and implementing policies
  about the information that can be made publicly accessible, publicly
  accessible content addresses the management of the individuals who make such
  information publicly accessible. Related Control(s): AC-3, AT-2, AT-3, AU-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing publicly
  accessible content; list of users authorized to post publicly accessible
  content on organizational systems; training materials and/or records; records
  of publicly accessible information reviews; records of response to non-public
  information on public websites; system audit logs; security awareness training
  records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  managing publicly accessible information posted on organizational systems;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing management of publicly accessible
