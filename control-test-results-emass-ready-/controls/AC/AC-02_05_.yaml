control-information: >-
  Description:

  Require that users log out when [Assignment: organization-defined time period
  of expected inactivity or description of when to log out].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Inactivity logout is behavior- or policy-based and requires users to take
  physical action to log out when they are expecting inactivity longer than the
  defined period. Automatic enforcement of inactivity logout is addressed by
  AC-11. Related Control(s): AC-11.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; security violation reports; system audit records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; users that must comply with inactivity
  logout policy].

  Keycloak fully supports session timeouts through configurable settings that
  manage the lifecycle of sessions. It allows you to set an SSO session idle
  timeout, which determines how long a session can remain inactive before being
  automatically terminated, as well as an SSO session max timeout, which imposes
  an absolute limit on the session's duration regardless of activity.
  Additionally, for offline sessionsâ€”such as those used with "remember me"
  functionality separate configurations exist to manage both idle timeouts and
  maximum lifespans. These settings are accessible and adjustable through the
  Keycloak admin console under the realm's token settings, enabling you to
  tailor session management to meet specific security and user experience
  requirements.

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.
