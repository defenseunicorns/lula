control-acronym: "[r5] AC-14"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Identify [Assignment: organization-defined user actions] that can be
  performed on the system without identification or authentication consistent
  with organizational mission and business functions; and

  b. Document and provide supporting rationale in the security plan for the
  system, user actions not requiring identification or authentication.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Specific user actions may be permitted without identification or
  authentication if organizations determine that identification and
  authentication are not required for the specified user actions. Organizations
  may allow a limited number of user actions without identification or
  authentication, including when individuals access public websites or other
  publicly accessible federal systems, when individuals use mobile phones to
  receive calls, or when facsimiles are received. Organizations identify actions
  that normally require identification or authentication but may, under certain
  circumstances, allow identification or authentication mechanisms to be
  bypassed. Such bypasses may occur, for example, via a software-readable
  physical switch that commands bypass of the logon functionality and is
  protected from accidental or unmonitored use. Permitting actions without
  identification or authentication does not apply to situations where
  identification and authentication have already occurred and are not repeated
  but rather to situations where identification and authentication have not yet
  occurred. Organizations may decide that there are no user actions that can be
  performed on organizational systems without identification and authentication,
  and therefore, the value for the assignment operation can be none. Related

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing permitted
  actions without identification or authentication; system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; security plan; list of user actions
  that can be performed without identification or authentication; system audit
  records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].

compliance-status: Not Applicable
test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS inherently enforces
  strong authentication and identification through its centralized identity
  management system, Keycloak, ensuring all interactions with sensitive or
  protected resources require identification and authentication. While the
  platform supports granular access control and typically mandates
  authentication for most actions, explicitly defining which specific user
  actions (such as accessing public-facing status pages or health-check
  endpoints) may be permitted without authentication is an organizational
  decision. Organizations deploying UDS must formally define, document, and
  explicitly approve any exceptions to authentication requirements, clearly
  specifying permissible unauthenticated actions (e.g., public API health checks
  or metrics endpoints) within their security policies or Standard Operating
  Procedures (SOPs). Although UDS technically supports enforcing strong
  authentication standards, the explicit definition of allowed unauthenticated
  interactions remains an organizational responsibility.)
rev-4-migration-notes: "Automatically generated test result during Revision 5
  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: AC-14.1; as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements:
  CCI-003695. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test
  result/compliance statement: AC-14.1. The resulting compliance status was set
  to non-compliant because of the addition of a new security requirement to the
  assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed: CCI-003695."
