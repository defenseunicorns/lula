  Description:

  Provide a consistent interpretation of security and privacy attributes
  transmitted between distributed system components.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  To enforce security and privacy policies across multiple system components in
  distributed systems, organizations provide a consistent interpretation of
  security and privacy attributes employed in access enforcement and flow
  enforcement decisions. Organizations can establish agreements and processes to
  help ensure that distributed system components implement attributes with
  consistent interpretations in automated access enforcement and flow
  enforcement actions. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policies and procedures; procedures
  addressing consistent interpretation of security and privacy attributes
  transmitted between distributed system components; procedures addressing
  access enforcement; procedures addressing information flow enforcement; system
  design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system audit records; system security plan; privacy access
  control policy; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  providing consistent interpretation of security and privacy attributes used in
  access enforcement and information flow enforcement actions; organizational
  personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities; system
  developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing access enforcement and information
  flow enforcement functions].
