control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Establish configuration requirements, connection requirements, and
  implementation guidance for organization-controlled mobile devices, to include
  when such devices are outside of controlled areas; and

  b. Authorize the connection of mobile devices to organizational systems.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that
  it can easily be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate
  without a physical connection; possesses local, non-removable or removable
  data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Mobile device
  functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board
  sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features
  for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart
  phones and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single
  individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile
  device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems,
  depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Protection and
  control of mobile devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to
  take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of
  controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide
  physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for
  protecting information and systems.


  Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and
  capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes
  or types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation
  guidance for mobile devices include configuration management, device
  identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective
  software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection
  software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting
  primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity
  checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware.


  Usage restrictions and authorization to connect may vary among organizational
  systems. For example, the organization may authorize the connection of mobile
  devices to its network and impose a set of usage restrictions, while a system
  owner may withhold authorization for mobile device connection to specific
  applications or impose additional usage restrictions before allowing mobile
  device connections to a system. Adequate security for mobile devices goes
  beyond the requirements specified in AC-19. Many safeguards for mobile devices
  are reflected in other controls. AC-20 addresses mobile devices that are not
  organization-controlled. Related Control(s): AC-3, AC-4, AC-7, AC-11, AC-17,
  AC-18, AC-20, CA-9, CM-2, CM-6, IA-2, IA-3, MP-2, MP-4, MP-5, MP-7, PL-4,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing access
  control for mobile device usage (including restrictions); configuration
  management plan; system design documentation; system configuration settings
  and associated documentation; authorizations for mobile device connections to
  organizational systems; system audit records; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel using mobile devices to
  access organizational systems; system/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Access control capability for mobile device connections to
  organizational systems; configurations of mobile devices].
