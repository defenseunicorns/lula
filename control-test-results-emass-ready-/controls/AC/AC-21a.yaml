control-acronym: "[r5] AC-21"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Enable authorized users to determine whether access authorizations assigned
  to a sharing partner match the information’s access and use restrictions for
  [Assignment: organization-defined information sharing circumstances where user
  discretion is required]; and

  b. Employ [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms or manual
  processes] to assist users in making information sharing and collaboration
  decisions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information sharing applies to information that may be restricted in some
  manner based on some formal or administrative determination. Examples of such
  information include, contract-sensitive information, classified information
  related to special access programs or compartments, privileged information,
  proprietary information, and personally identifiable information. Security and
  privacy risk assessments as well as applicable laws, regulations, and policies
  can provide useful inputs to these determinations. Depending on the
  circumstances, sharing partners may be defined at the individual, group, or
  organizational level. Information may be defined by content, type, security
  category, or special access program or compartment. Access restrictions may
  include non-disclosure agreements (NDA). Information flow techniques and
  security attributes may be used to provide automated assistance to users
  making sharing and collaboration decisions. Related Control(s): AC-3, AC-4,
  AC-16, PT-2, PT-7, RA-3, SC-15.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing user-based
  collaboration and information sharing (including restrictions); system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  list of users authorized to make information-sharing/collaboration decisions;
  list of information-sharing circumstances requiring user discretion;
  non-disclosure agreements; acquisitions/contractual agreements; system
  security plan; privacy plan; privacy impact assessment; security and privacy
  risk assessments; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel responsible for
  information-sharing/collaboration decisions; organizational personnel with
  responsibility for acquisitions/contractual agreements; system/network
  administrators; organizational personnel with information security and privacy
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms or manual process implementing access
  authorizations supporting information-sharing/user collaboration decisions].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: AC-21.1, AC-21.2.
  The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following
  Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance
  statement: AC-21.2.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The UDS stack itself doesn’t
  facilitate user-to-user information sharing beyond hosting applications that
  might do so. However, it provides controls to ensure that any sharing of data
  through UDS applications is access-controlled. For instance, if two users from
  different projects use an application on UDS, Keycloak can enforce that each
  user only accesses their authorized project data. So, while UDS doesn’t
  implement a policy for information sharing, it enables secure sharing by
  honoring the access rules configured (no unauthorized cross-tenant data
  access, etc.). Also, audit logs (through Loki) can track when information is
  accessed or shared.)
