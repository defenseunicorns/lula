control-information: >-
  Description:

  Automatically audit account creation, modification, enabling, disabling, and
  removal actions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Account management audit records are defined in accordance with AU-2 and
  reviewed, analyzed, and reported in accordance with AU-6. Related Control(s):
  AU-2, AU-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; notifications/alerts of account creation,
  modification, enabling, disabling, and removal actions; system audit records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing account management
  functions].

  Keycloak provides all account lifecycle events – account creation,
  modification, enabling/disabling, and deletions are recorded as admin events​.
  These audit records are forwarded to UDS’s centralized logging (Loki),
  preserving a history of account actions. Notifications to personnel can be
  configured. Keycloak supports event listeners if required (e.g., sending an
  email to administrators when an account is created or deleted)​. With these
  capabilities, UDS meets the intent by auditing account changes and
  (optionally) alerting administrators of those changes.

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.
