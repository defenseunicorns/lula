control-information: >-
  Description:

  Identify and explicitly authorize users allowed to independently configure
  wireless networking capabilities.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizational authorizations to allow selected users to configure wireless
  networking capabilities are enforced, in part, by the access enforcement
  mechanisms employed within organizational systems. Related Control(s): SC-7,
  SC-15.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing wireless
  implementation and usage (including restrictions); system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms authorizing independent user configuration of
  wireless networking capabilities].

  are identified.

  - users allowed to independently configure wireless networking capabilities
  are explicitly authorized.

compliance-status: Not Applicable
test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS does not inherently
  control the use of wireless networking. Any wireless access control would be
  handled by the underlying network infrastructure, not by UDS itself i.e.
  wireless network adapters and bluetooth would be enabled/disabled at the
  operating system.)
rev-4-migration-notes: "Automatically generated test result during Revision 5
  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: AC-18(4).1. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally
  entered test result/compliance statement: AC-18(4).1."
