control-acronym: "[r5] AC-02(07)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Establish and administer privileged user accounts in accordance with
  [Selection: a role-based access scheme; an attribute-based access scheme];

  (b) Monitor privileged role or attribute assignments;

  (c) Monitor changes to roles or attributes; and

  (d) Revoke access when privileged role or attribute assignments are no longer
  appropriate.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals that
  allow those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that
  ordinary users are not authorized to perform. Privileged roles include key
  management, account management, database administration, system and network
  administration, and web administration. A role-based access scheme organizes
  permitted system access and privileges into roles. In contrast, an
  attribute-based access scheme specifies allowed system access and privileges
  based on attributes. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; system-generated list of privileged user accounts
  and associated roles; records of actions taken when privileged role
  assignments are no longer appropriate; system audit records; audit tracking
  and monitoring reports; system monitoring records; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing account management functions;
  mechanisms monitoring privileged role assignments].

test-results: Keycloak monitors privileged role assignments through its built-in
  event listeners and audit logging mechanisms. When a privileged role is
  assigned, Keycloak generates an admin event that includes details such as the
  realm, client, user, and assigned role. These events are stored in the
  database and can be sent to external logging systems via the Event Listener
  SPI, which supports integrations with Loki, syslog, or custom audit handlers.
  By configuring Loki as an external logging backend, Keycloak can stream role
  assignment events in real-time, enabling administrators to query, visualize,
  and set up alerts for high-privilege role changes using Grafana.
  Administrators can configure policies using fine-grained authorization with
  Keycloak's Authorization Services to enforce role assignment approvals,
  implement review workflows, or trigger alerts for high-privilege role changes.
