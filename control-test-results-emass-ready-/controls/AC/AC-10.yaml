control-acronym: "[r5] AC-10"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Limit the number of concurrent sessions for each [Assignment:
  organization-defined account and/or account type] to [Assignment:
  organization-defined number].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations may define the maximum number of concurrent sessions for system
  accounts globally, by account type, by account, or any combination thereof.
  For example, organizations may limit the number of concurrent sessions for
  system administrators or other individuals working in particularly sensitive
  domains or mission-critical applications. Concurrent session control addresses
  concurrent sessions for system accounts. It does not, however, address
  concurrent sessions by single users via multiple system accounts. Related
  Control(s): SC-23.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing concurrent
  session control; system design documentation; system configuration settings
  and associated documentation; security plan; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing access control policy for
  concurrent session control].

  UDS effectively limits the number of concurrent user sessions through its
  centralized identity management solution, Keycloak. Administrators explicitly
  configure this in the Keycloak administrative interface by navigating to
  Authentication → Sessions → Realm Sessions and setting the "Session Limits"
  parameters, specifically the "Max Sessions" field. These settings allow the
  enforcement of maximum concurrent session limits per individual user or
  defined account types, aligning precisely with organizational policy. Once
  configured, Keycloak automatically enforces these session constraints by
  terminating or preventing additional sessions beyond the defined limit.

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.
