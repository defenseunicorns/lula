control-acronym: "[r5] AC-02(07)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Establish and administer privileged user accounts in accordance with
  [Selection: a role-based access scheme; an attribute-based access scheme];

  (b) Monitor privileged role or attribute assignments;

  (c) Monitor changes to roles or attributes; and

  (d) Revoke access when privileged role or attribute assignments are no longer
  appropriate.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals that
  allow those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that
  ordinary users are not authorized to perform. Privileged roles include key
  management, account management, database administration, system and network
  administration, and web administration. A role-based access scheme organizes
  permitted system access and privileges into roles. In contrast, an
  attribute-based access scheme specifies allowed system access and privileges
  based on attributes. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; system-generated list of privileged user accounts
  and associated roles; records of actions taken when privileged role
  assignments are no longer appropriate; system audit records; audit tracking
  and monitoring reports; system monitoring records; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing account management functions;
  mechanisms monitoring privileged role assignments].

  Keycloak can implement a systematic procedure for disabling or revoking
  privileged user accounts by leveraging its built-in role-based access control
  (RBAC) and auditing capabilities. Administrators can regularly review
  privileged roles and, when the assignments are no longer appropriate, remove
  or disable the associated account through the Keycloak Admin Console or API.
  By disabling an account (or removing the role assignment) rather than simply
  deleting it, organizations preserve the accountâ€™s historical data for audit or
  investigative purposes, satisfying DoD requirements. Every administrative
  action in Keycloak, such as disabling accounts or revoking roles, can be
  logged through its auditing and event features, ensuring an audit trail is
  maintained. This log data includes the timestamp of the action, the
  administrator or service principal responsible, and the nature of the change,
  providing the necessary evidence for compliance and governance reviews.
