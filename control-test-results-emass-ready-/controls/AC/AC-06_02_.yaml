control-acronym: "[r5] AC-06(02)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Require that users of system accounts (or roles) with access to [Assignment:
  organization-defined security functions or security-relevant information] use
  non-privileged accounts or roles, when accessing nonsecurity functions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Requiring the use of non-privileged accounts when accessing nonsecurity
  functions limits exposure when operating from within privileged accounts or
  roles. The inclusion of roles addresses situations where organizations
  implement access control policies, such as role-based access control, and
  where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of
  access authorizations for the user and the processes acting on behalf of the
  user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged
  account. Related Control(s): AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, PL-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing least
  privilege; list of system-generated security functions or security-relevant
  information assigned to system accounts or roles; system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; system audit records; system security
  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  defining least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing least privilege functions].

  In UDS, administrators typically have a dedicated admin account in Keycloak
  (with admin roles) separate from any normal user account they might use for
  day-to-day usage of applications. The stack doesn’t enforce this separation on
  its own, but it supports it by allowing multiple accounts per person or
  multiple roles that can be toggled. For example, an admin might have an
  unprivileged account for general use and a privileged account for
  administration UDS’s access controls can ensure the admin only accesses
  critical functions with the proper account. While the implementation (having
  separate accounts) is a policy decision, UDS fully accommodates it by
  segregating permissions by account and role, thereby aligning with the intent
  of limiting use of privileged credentials to when they are needed.

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.
