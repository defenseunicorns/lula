  g. Monitor the use of accounts;

  h. Notify account managers and [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
  roles] within:

  1. [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when accounts are no longer
  required;

  2. [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when users are terminated or
  transferred; and

  3. [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when system usage or
  need-to-know changes for an individual;

  i. Authorize access to the system based on:

  1. A valid access authorization;

  2. Intended system usage; and

  3. [Assignment: organization-defined attributes (as required)];

  j. Review accounts for compliance with account management requirements
  [Assignment: organization-defined frequency];

  k. Establish and implement a process for changing shared or group account
  authenticators (if deployed) when individuals are removed from the group; and

  l. Align account management processes with personnel termination and transfer
  processes.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Examples of system account types include individual, shared, group, system,
  guest, anonymous, emergency, developer, temporary, and service. Identification
  of authorized system users and the specification of access privileges reflect
  the requirements in other controls in the security plan. Users requiring
  administrative privileges on system accounts receive additional scrutiny by
  organizational personnel responsible for approving such accounts and
  privileged access, including system owner, mission or business owner, senior
  agency information security officer, or senior agency official for privacy.
  Types of accounts that organizations may wish to prohibit due to increased
  risk include shared, group, emergency, anonymous, temporary, and guest
  accounts.


  Where access involves personally identifiable information, security programs
  collaborate with the senior agency official for privacy to establish the
  specific conditions for group and role membership; specify authorized users,
  group and role membership, and access authorizations for each account; and
  create, adjust, or remove system accounts in accordance with organizational
  policies. Policies can include such information as account expiration dates or
  other factors that trigger the disabling of accounts. Organizations may choose
  to define access privileges or other attributes by account, type of account,
  or a combination of the two. Examples of other attributes required for
  authorizing access include restrictions on time of day, day of week, and point
  of origin. In defining other system account attributes, organizations consider
  system-related requirements and mission/business requirements. Failure to
  consider these factors could affect system availability.


  Temporary and emergency accounts are intended for short-term use.
  Organizations establish temporary accounts as part of normal account
  activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the
  demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency
  accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account
  activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account
  authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be
  confused with infrequently used accounts, including local logon accounts used
  for special tasks or when network resources are unavailable (may also be known
  as accounts of last resort). Such accounts remain available and are not
  subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or
  deactivating accounts include when shared/group, emergency, or temporary
  accounts are no longer required and when individuals are transferred or
  terminated. Changing shared/group authenticators when members leave the group
  is intended to ensure that former group members do not retain access to the
  shared or group account. Some types of system accounts may require specialized
  training. Related Control(s): AC-3, AC-5, AC-6, AC-17, AC-18, AC-20, AC-24,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; personnel termination policy and
  procedure; personnel transfer policy and procedure; procedures for addressing
  account management; system design documentation; system configuration settings
  and associated documentation; list of active system accounts along with the
  name of the individual associated with each account; list of recently disabled
  system accounts and the name of the individual associated with each account;
  list of conditions for group and role membership; notifications of recent
  transfers, separations, or terminations of employees; access authorization
  records; account management compliance reviews; system monitoring records;
  system audit records; system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security with information security and privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for account management on the
  system; mechanisms for implementing account management].

test-results: The UDS stack enforces that only authorized users can hold and use
  accounts. Keycloak requires an admin to explicitly create a user account or
  approve self-registrations (if allowed by the ISSM/AO), and those admins are
  appointed by the organization. This means only users who have been authorized
  by an administrator have accounts on the system. In Kubernetes, service
  accounts are created via controlled IaC or by cluster admins. Thus, for each
  account (human or service), there is an implicit authorization step by an
  administrator, fulfilling the requirement to specify authorized users for each
  account type. Organizational valid access authorization is typically issued in
  the DD Form 2875, SYSTEM AUTHORIZATION ACCESS REQUEST (SAAR).
