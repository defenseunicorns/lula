control-acronym: "[r5] AC-12(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Provide a logout capability for user-initiated communications sessions
  whenever authentication is used to gain access to [Assignment:
  organization-defined information resources].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information resources to which users gain access via authentication include
  local workstations, databases, and password-protected websites or web-based
  services. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing session
  termination; user logout messages; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: System session termination mechanisms; logout capabilities
  for user-initiated communications sessions].

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.

  Within UDS, when a user clicks "logout," they receive a confirmation prompt.
  Once confirmed, Keycloak terminates the user's session. Because Keycloak
  functions as the centralized Single Sign-On (SSO) provider for all UDS
  applications, logging out of Keycloak results in the user being signed out of
  the entire system.
