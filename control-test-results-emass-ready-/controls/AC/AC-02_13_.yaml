control-information: >-
  Description:

  Disable accounts of individuals within [Assignment: organization-defined time
  period] of discovery of [Assignment: organization-defined significant risks].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Users who pose a significant security and/or privacy risk include individuals
  for whom reliable evidence indicates either the intention to use authorized
  access to systems to cause harm or through whom adversaries will cause harm.
  Such harm includes adverse impacts to organizational operations,
  organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation. Close
  coordination among system administrators, legal staff, human resource
  managers, and authorizing officials is essential when disabling system
  accounts for high-risk individuals. Related Control(s): AU-6, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; system-generated list of disabled accounts; list of
  user activities posing significant organizational risk; system audit records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing account management functions].

cci-definition: "002150: Defines the time period within which the accounts of
  users posing a significant risk are to be disabled after discovery of the
  risk.; 002151: Disable accounts of individuals within an organization-defined
  time-period of discovery of organization-defined significant risk.; 003637:
  Defines the significant risks that may be discovered requiring disabled
  accounts of individuals."
implementation-guidance: CCI-002150 of this assessment procedure is
  automatically compliant because of coverage by DoD Enterprise.

  [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of discovery of [Assignment:

test-results: >-
  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: AC-2(13).1,
  AC-2(13).2; as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-003637.
  The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following
  Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance
  statement: AC-2(13).2. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because of the addition of a new security requirement to the
  assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed: CCI-003637.


  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.

  Not applicable to UDS technology stack. (Defining the process for disabling
  accounts of users posing a significant risk is highly organization dependent.)
