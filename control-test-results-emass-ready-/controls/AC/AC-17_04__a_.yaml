control-acronym: "[r5] AC-17(04)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Authorize the execution of privileged commands and access to
  security-relevant information via remote access only in a format that provides
  assessable evidence and for the following needs: [Assignment:
  organization-defined needs]; and

  (b) Document the rationale for remote access in the security plan for the
  system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Remote access to systems represents a significant potential vulnerability that
  can be exploited by adversaries. As such, restricting the execution of
  privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote
  access reduces the exposure of the organization and the susceptibility to
  threats by adversaries to the remote access capability. Related Control(s):
  AC-6, SC-12, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing remote
  access to the system; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; security plan; system audit records; system security plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing remote access management].

  Determine if:

  - the execution of privileged commands via remote access is authorized only in
  a format that provides assessable evidence.

  - access to security-relevant information via remote access is authorized only
  in a format that provides assessable evidence.
