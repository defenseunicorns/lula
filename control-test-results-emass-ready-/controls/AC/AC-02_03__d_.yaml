control-acronym: "[r5] AC-02(03)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Disable accounts within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when
  the accounts:

  (a) Have expired;

  (b) Are no longer associated with a user or individual;

  (c) Are in violation of organizational policy; or

  (d) Have been inactive for [Assignment: organization-defined time period].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Disabling expired, inactive, or otherwise anomalous accounts supports the
  concepts of least privilege and least functionality which reduce the attack
  surface of the system. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures for addressing
  account management; system security plan; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system-generated list of
  accounts removed; system-generated list of emergency accounts disabled; system
  audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms for implementing account management functions].

  Not Applicable to tech stack. (This control calls for automatically disabling
  inactive accounts after an organization-defined time. Out-of-the-box, Keycloak
  does not automatically lock or remove user accounts purely due to inactivity
  over a long period. Administrators would have to periodically review login
  activity (which Keycloak records per user) and manually disable accounts that
  haven't been used within the threshold. It’s possible to extend Keycloak or
  use scripts to implement this (e.g., a scheduled job that queries for users
  who haven't logged in within 60 days and disables them), but UDS doesn’t
  include that automation by default. Thus, while the data is available (last
  login timestamps, etc., are accessible and could be acted on), UDS only
  partially meets this control: inactive account disabling must be handled via
  administrative process or additional tooling.)

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.
