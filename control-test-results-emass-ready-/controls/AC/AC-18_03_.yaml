control-acronym: "[r5] AC-18(03)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Disable, when not intended for use, wireless networking capabilities embedded
  within system components prior to issuance and deployment.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Wireless networking capabilities that are embedded within system components
  represent a significant potential vulnerability that can be exploited by
  adversaries. Disabling wireless capabilities when not needed for essential
  organizational missions or functions can reduce susceptibility to threats by
  adversaries involving wireless technologies. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing wireless
  implementation and usage (including restrictions); system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms managing the disabling of wireless networking
  capabilities internally embedded within system components].

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS does not inherently
  control the use of wireless networking. Any wireless access control would be
  handled by the underlying network infrastructure, not by UDS itself i.e.
  wireless network adapters and bluetooth would be enabled/disabled at the
  operating system.)

  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: AC-18(3).1. The resulting compliance status was set to
