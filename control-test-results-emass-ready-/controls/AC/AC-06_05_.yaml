  Description:

  Restrict privileged accounts on the system to [Assignment:
  organization-defined personnel or roles].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically described as
  system administrator for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating
  systems. Restricting privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles
  prevents day-to-day users from accessing privileged information or privileged
  functions. Organizations may differentiate in the application of restricting
  privileged accounts between allowed privileges for local accounts and for
  domain accounts provided that they retain the ability to control system
  configurations for key parameters and as otherwise necessary to sufficiently
  mitigate risk. Related Control(s): IA-2, MA-3, MA-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing least
  privilege; list of system-generated privileged accounts; list of system
  administration personnel; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system audit records; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  defining least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing least privilege functions].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration

  the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test
  result/compliance statement: AC-6(5).1.


  Not applicable to the UDS technology stack. (UDS platform provides robust
  technical capabilities to restrict privileged accounts through its centralized
  identity management solution (Keycloak) and Kubernetes Role-Based Access
  Control (RBAC). Privileged roles such as system administrators, security
  managers, or auditors can be explicitly defined and assigned granular
  permissions within Keycloak and Kubernetes, ensuring privileged access is
  strictly controlled. However, explicitly defining and documenting the specific
  personnel or organizational roles authorized to receive privileged accounts
  remains an organizational responsibility. While UDS fully supports enforcing
  privileged access restrictions, the organization deploying UDS must formally
  document and approve the assignment of privileged roles and accounts within
  internal security policies )
