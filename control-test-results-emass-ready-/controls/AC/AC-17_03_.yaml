control-acronym: "[r5] AC-17(03)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Route remote accesses through authorized and managed network access control
  points.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations consider the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) initiative DHS
  TIC requirements for external network connections since limiting the number of
  access control points for remote access reduces attack surfaces. Related
  Control(s): SC-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing remote
  access to the system; system design documentation; list of all managed network
  access control points; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; system audit records; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms routing all remote accesses through managed
  network access control points].
