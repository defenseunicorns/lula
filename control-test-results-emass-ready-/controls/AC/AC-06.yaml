control-acronym: "[r5] AC-06"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Employ the principle of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for
  users (or processes acting on behalf of users) that are necessary to
  accomplish assigned organizational tasks.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations employ least privilege for specific duties and systems. The
  principle of least privilege is also applied to system processes, ensuring
  that the processes have access to systems and operate at privilege levels no
  higher than necessary to accomplish organizational missions or business
  functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles,
  and accounts as necessary to achieve least privilege. Organizations apply
  least privilege to the development, implementation, and operation of
  organizational systems. Related Control(s): AC-2, AC-3, AC-5, AC-16, CM-5,
  CM-11, PL-2, PM-12, SA-8, SA-15, SA-17, SC-38.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing least
  privilege; list of assigned access authorizations (user privileges); system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  defining least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing least privilege functions].

test-results: "UDS strongly supports the principle of least privilege. Keycloak
  enforces least privilege access through role-based access control (RBAC),
  supporting predefined account types (General User, Admin, Viewer, etc.) and
  hierarchical security grouping. By default, components and accounts in the
  stack have minimal rights: for example, new Keycloak users have no roles until
  assigned, and Kubernetes service accounts have no permissions unless bound to
  a role. Administrators explicitly grant only the necessary privileges via
  roles and permissions. Kubernetes RBAC is used to ensure accounts (and even
  applications) only get the minimal permissions needed to functionâ€‹.
  Additionally, container workloads can be restricted to least privilege at the
  OS level (running as non-root users, minimal file system privileges) which is
  encouraged and can be enforced by policy (via Pepr or admission controllers
  requiring securityContext settings). The AuthService/Keycloak integration also
  means applications don't each have elevated privileges for authentication;
  instead, they delegate to Keycloak, further limiting where sensitive
  credentials are used. Every layer cluster, service mesh, and application uses
  roles and policies to ensure no entity has more access than absolutely
  required, effectively implementing least privilege."
