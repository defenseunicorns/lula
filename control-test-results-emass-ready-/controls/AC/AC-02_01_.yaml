  Description:

  Support the management of system accounts using [Assignment:
  organization-defined automated mechanisms].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Automated system account management includes using automated mechanisms to
  create, enable, modify, disable, and remove accounts; notify account managers
  when an account is created, enabled, modified, disabled, or removed, or when
  users are terminated or transferred; monitor system account usage; and report
  atypical system account usage. Automated mechanisms can include internal
  system functions and email, telephonic, and text messaging notifications.
  Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures for addressing
  account management; system design documentation; system configuration settings
  and associated documentation; system audit records; system security plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security with information security responsibilities; system
  developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms for implementing account management
  functions].

test-results: UDS supports automated mechanisms for account management via
  Keycloak. Keycloak automates many account management functions (creation,
  disablement, role assignments) through its interface and APIs, reducing the
  need for manual processes and meeting the intent of AC-2(1).
