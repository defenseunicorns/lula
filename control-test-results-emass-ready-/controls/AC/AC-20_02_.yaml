control-information: >-
  Description:

  Restrict the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices by
  authorized individuals on external systems using [Assignment:
  organization-defined restrictions].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Limits on the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices in
  external systems include restrictions on how the devices may be used and under
  what conditions the devices may be used. Related Control(s): MP-7, SC-41.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing the use of
  external systems; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  system connection or processing agreements; account management documents;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  restricting or prohibiting the use of organization-controlled storage devices
  on external systems; system/network administrators; organizational personnel
  with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing restrictions on the use of
  portable storage devices].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: AC-20(2).1; as
  well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-003758. The resulting
  compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following Rev. 4
  assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance statement:
  AC-20(2).1. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  of the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that
  has not been previously assessed: CCI-003758.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Any restrictions on using UDS from
  personal or external devices, or terms of use for external system connections,
  must be handled by policy. UDS does not inherently enforce device-specific
  rules beyond standard network access control. The expectation is that the
  hosting environmentâ€™s policies prevent unauthorized external system use.)
