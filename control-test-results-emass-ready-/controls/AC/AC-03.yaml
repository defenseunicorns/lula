  Description:

  Enforce approved authorizations for logical access to information and system
  resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Access control policies control access between active entities or subjects
  (i.e., users or processes acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or
  objects (i.e., devices, files, records, domains) in organizational systems. In
  addition to enforcing authorized access at the system level and recognizing
  that systems can host many applications and services in support of mission and
  business functions, access enforcement mechanisms can also be employed at the
  application and service level to provide increased information security and
  privacy. In contrast to logical access controls that are implemented within
  the system, physical access controls are addressed by the controls in the
  Physical and Environmental Protection (PE) family. Related Control(s): AC-2,
  AC-4, AC-5, AC-6, AC-16, AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, AC-20, AC-21, AC-22, AC-24,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing access
  enforcement; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; list of approved authorizations (user privileges);
  system audit records; system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with access enforcement
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security and privacy responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing access control policy].

test-results: "UDS enforces access control for systems and services through
  multiple layers. At the application level, Keycloak ensures that only
  authenticated and authorized users can access protected applications (via
  OAuth2/OIDC tokens or SSO sessions). At the service/microservice level,
  AuthService (integrated with Istio’s Envoy sidecars) acts as a policy
  enforcement point to check user tokens and permissions before allowing API
  requests, ensuring that application-level access policies are uniformly
  enforced. Additionally, Kubernetes RBAC ensures that administrative operations
  (like deploying a container or accessing a config) are only executed by
  principals with the correct role. In effect, every request in the UDS
  environment whether a user logging into a web app or a service calling another
  service – goes through an access control check: user requests are vetted by
  Keycloak/AuthService, and inter-service calls are controlled by Istio’s
  security policies. These mechanisms collectively satisfy the control’s intent
  by enforcing assigned access privileges on all attempted actions in the
  system."
