control-acronym: "[r5] AC-20(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Permit authorized individuals to use an external system to access the system
  or to process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information only
  after:

  (a) Verification of the implementation of controls on the external system as
  specified in the organizationâ€™s security and privacy policies and security and
  privacy plans; or

  (b) Retention of approved system connection or processing agreements with the
  organizational entity hosting the external system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Limiting authorized use recognizes circumstances where individuals using
  external systems may need to access organizational systems. Organizations need
  assurance that the external systems contain the necessary controls so as not
  to compromise, damage, or otherwise harm organizational systems. Verification
  that the required controls have been implemented can be achieved by external,
  independent assessments, attestations, or other means, depending on the
  confidence level required by organizations. Related Control(s): CA-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing the use of
  external systems; system connection or processing agreements; account
  management documents; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing limits on use of external
  systems].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: AC-20(1).1,
  AC-20(1).2, AC-20(1).3, AC-20(1).4; as well as the following Rev. 5 security
  requirements: CCI-003756, CCI-003757. The resulting compliance status was set
  to non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no
  locally entered test result/compliance statement: AC-20(1).1, AC-20(1).2,
  AC-20(1).3, AC-20(1).4. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because of the addition of a new security requirement to the
  assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed: CCI-003756,
  CCI-003757.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (An MOU/MOA must be written according
  to the organizational requirements and is handled outside of the system though
  technical access can be enforced by UDS.)
