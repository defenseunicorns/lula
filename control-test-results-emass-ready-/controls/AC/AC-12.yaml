control-information: >-
  Description:

  Automatically terminate a user session after [Assignment: organization-defined
  conditions or trigger events requiring session disconnect].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Session termination addresses the termination of user-initiated logical
  sessions (in contrast to SC-10, which addresses the termination of network
  connections associated with communications sessions (i.e., network
  disconnect)). A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is
  initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an
  organizational system. Such user sessions can be terminated without
  terminating network sessions. Session termination ends all processes
  associated with a user’s logical session except for those processes that are
  specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the
  session is terminated. Conditions or trigger events that require automatic
  termination of the session include organization-defined periods of user
  inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, or time-of-day
  restrictions on system use. Related Control(s): MA-4, SC-10, SC-23.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing session
  termination; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; list of conditions or trigger events requiring
  session disconnect; system audit records; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing user session
  termination].

test-results: UDS supports reliable session termination. When a user logs out of
  an application (or out of Keycloak), Keycloak’s single sign-out functionality
  ends the user’s session for all client applications logged in via that token.
  This ensures that all associated sessions are invalidated upon user logout​.
  Also, sessions are terminated when their allotted time expires (as
  configured). On the administrative side, an admin can explicitly revoke a
  user’s sessions in Keycloak at any time (for example, if a user is suspected
  compromised, an admin can force-log-out that account from all services). In
  the service mesh, if a token is no longer valid, AuthService will reject
  further requests with that token. Thus, whether the session ends normally
  (user logout) or abnormally (token expiration or manual revocation), UDS
  cleanly terminates the session and prevents further use of those credentials.
  This behavior satisfies the requirement for session termination.
