control-information: >-
  Description:

  Employ [Selection: full-device encryption; container-based encryption] to
  protect the confidentiality and integrity of information on [Assignment:
  organization-defined mobile devices].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Container-based encryption provides a more fine-grained approach to data and
  information encryption on mobile devices, including encrypting selected data
  structures such as files, records, or fields. Related Control(s): SC-12,
  SC-13, SC-28.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing access
  control for mobile devices; system design documentation; system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; encryption mechanisms and associated
  configuration documentation; system audit records; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with access control
  responsibilities for mobile devices; system/network administrators;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Encryption mechanisms protecting confidentiality and
  integrity of information on mobile devices].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: AC-19(5).1,
  AC-19(5).2, AC-19(5).3. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally
  entered test result/compliance statement: AC-19(5).1, AC-19(5).2, AC-19(5).3.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Though UDS support FIPS encryption
  this control refers to policies for mobile device access. UDS is accessed via
  standard information systems; any mobile device management or controls are
  outside the scope of the UDS technology stack.)
