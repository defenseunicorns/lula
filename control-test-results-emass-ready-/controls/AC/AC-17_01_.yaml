control-acronym: "[r5] AC-17(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Employ automated mechanisms to monitor and control remote access methods.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Monitoring and control of remote access methods allows organizations to detect
  attacks and help ensure compliance with remote access policies by auditing the
  connection activities of remote users on a variety of system components,
  including servers, notebook computers, workstations, smart phones, and
  tablets. Audit logging for remote access is enforced by AU-2. Audit events are
  defined in AU-2a. Related Control(s): AU-2, AU-6, AU-12, AU-14.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing remote
  access to the system; system design documentation; system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; system audit records; system monitoring
  records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms monitoring and controlling remote
  access methods].
