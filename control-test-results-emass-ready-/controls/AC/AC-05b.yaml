control-acronym: "[r5] AC-05"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Identify and document [Assignment: organization-defined duties of
  individuals requiring separation]; and

  b. Define system access authorizations to support separation of duties.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized
  privileges and helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without
  collusion. Separation of duties includes dividing mission or business
  functions and support functions among different individuals or roles,
  conducting system support functions with different individuals, and ensuring
  that security personnel who administer access control functions do not also
  administer audit functions. Because separation of duty violations can span
  systems and application domains, organizations consider the entirety of
  systems and system components when developing policy on separation of duties.
  Separation of duties is enforced through the account management activities in
  AC-2, access control mechanisms in AC-3, and identity management activities in
  IA-2, IA-4, and IA-12. Related Control(s): AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, AU-9, CM-5,
  CM-11, CP-9, IA-2, IA-4, IA-5, IA-12, MA-3, MA-5, PS-2, SA-8, SA-17.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing divisions
  of responsibility and separation of duties; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; list of divisions of responsibility and separation
  of duties; system access authorizations; system audit records; system security
  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  defining appropriate divisions of responsibility and separation of duties;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing separation of duties policy].

test-results: UDS supports separation of duties through its role-based access
  controls. Different administrator roles can be defined in Keycloak (for
  example, one role for system administration, another for auditing) so no
  single user has unrestricted control without oversight. Kubernetes also uses
  Role-Based Access Control such that duties (like application deployment vs.
  security configuration) can be separated to different service accounts or
  users. This ensures that critical functions require collaboration (or at least
  distinct privileged accounts), aligning with AC-5. (Ultimately, assignment of
  roles to personnel is an organizational task, but the UDS stack provides the
  technical capability to enforce those distinct roles.)
