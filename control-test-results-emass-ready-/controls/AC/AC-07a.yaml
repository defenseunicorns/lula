control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Enforce a limit of [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive
  invalid logon attempts by a user during a [Assignment: organization-defined
  time period]; and

  b. Automatically [Selection (one or more): lock the account or node for an
  [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; lock the account or node until
  released by an administrator; delay next logon prompt per [Assignment:
  organization-defined delay algorithm]; notify system administrator; take other
  [Assignment: organization-defined action]] when the maximum number of
  unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The need to limit unsuccessful logon attempts and take subsequent action when
  the maximum number of attempts is exceeded applies regardless of whether the
  logon occurs via a local or network connection. Due to the potential for
  denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by systems are usually
  temporary and automatically release after a predetermined,
  organization-defined time period. If a delay algorithm is selected,
  organizations may employ different algorithms for different components of the
  system based on the capabilities of those components. Responses to
  unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating system and the
  application levels. Organization-defined actions that may be taken when the
  number of allowed consecutive invalid logon attempts is exceeded include
  prompting the user to answer a secret question in addition to the username and
  password, invoking a lockdown mode with limited user capabilities (instead of
  full lockout), allowing users to only logon from specified Internet Protocol
  (IP) addresses, requiring a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks, or applying
  user profiles such as location, time of day, IP address, device, or Media
  Access Control (MAC) address. If automatic system lockout or execution of a
  delay algorithm is not implemented in support of the availability objective,
  organizations consider a combination of other actions to help prevent brute
  force attacks. In addition to the above, organizations can prompt users to
  respond to a secret question before the number of allowed unsuccessful logon
  attempts is exceeded. Automatically unlocking an account after a specified
  period of time is generally not permitted. However, exceptions may be required
  based on operational mission or need. Related Control(s): AC-2, AC-9, AU-2,
  AU-6, IA-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing
  unsuccessful logon attempts; system design documentation; system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; system audit records; system security
  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system developers; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing access control policy for
  unsuccessful logon attempts].

  UDS addresses unsuccessful login attempt controls via Keycloak’s brute force
  protection features. Keycloak can automatically lock an account or temporarily
  disable login for a username after a configurable number of failed login
  attempts​. By enabling this in the Keycloak realm settings, if an attacker (or
  user) enters an incorrect password repeatedly, Keycloak will trigger a
  temporary lockout or even require administrator intervention after the
  threshold is exceeded​. This mechanism ensures that repeated failed login
  attempts are thwarted and accounts are not vulnerable to brute-force guessing
  attacks. The duration of lockout and thresholds are configurable to meet
  organizational policy. Thus, the stack meets the intent by providing a
  built-in technical control to automatically record unsuccessful login attempts
  and take action (lockout) when a defined limit is reached.
