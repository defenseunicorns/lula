control-acronym: "[r5] AC-23"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Employ [Assignment: organization-defined data mining prevention and detection
  techniques] for [Assignment: organization-defined data storage objects] to
  detect and protect against unauthorized data mining.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Data mining is an analytical process that attempts to find correlations or
  patterns in large data sets for the purpose of data or knowledge discovery.
  Data storage objects include database records and database fields. Sensitive
  information can be extracted from data mining operations. When information is
  personally identifiable information, it may lead to unanticipated revelations
  about individuals and give rise to privacy risks. Prior to performing data
  mining activities, organizations determine whether such activities are
  authorized. Organizations may be subject to applicable laws, executive orders,
  directives, regulations, or policies that address data mining requirements.
  Organizational personnel consult with the senior agency official for privacy
  and legal counsel regarding such requirements.


  Data mining prevention and detection techniques include limiting the number
  and frequency of database queries to increase the work factor needed to
  determine the contents of databases, limiting types of responses provided to
  database queries, applying differential privacy techniques or homomorphic
  encryption, and notifying personnel when atypical database queries or accesses
  occur. Data mining protection focuses on protecting information from data
  mining while such information resides in organizational data stores. In
  contrast, AU-13 focuses on monitoring for organizational information that may
  have been mined or otherwise obtained from data stores and is available as
  open-source information residing on external sites, such as social networking
  or social media websites.


  EO 13587 requires the establishment of an insider threat program for
  deterring, detecting, and mitigating insider threats, including the
  safeguarding of sensitive information from exploitation, compromise, or other
  unauthorized disclosure. Data mining protection requires organizations to
  identify appropriate techniques to prevent and detect unnecessary or
  unauthorized data mining. Data mining can be used by an insider to collect
  organizational information for the purpose of exfiltration. Related
  Control(s): PM-12, PT-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
