  Description:

  Prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Privileged functions include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented
  security or privacy controls, establishing system accounts, performing system
  integrity checks, and administering cryptographic key management activities.
  Non-privileged users are individuals who do not possess appropriate
  authorizations. Privileged functions that require protection from
  non-privileged users include circumventing intrusion detection and prevention
  mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms. Preventing non-privileged
  users from executing privileged functions is enforced by AC-3. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing least
  privilege; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; list of privileged functions and associated user
  account assignments; system audit records; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  defining least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities; system
  developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing least privilege functions for
  non-privileged users].

test-results: The UDS information system prevents non-privileged users from
  executing privileged functions, including disabling, circumventing, or
  altering implemented security safeguards and countermeasures. UDS utilizes
  Keycloak to manage user groups, and roles, which defines the separation of
  duties. This ensures that only authorized users can perform privileged
  functions such as establishing information system accounts, performing system
  integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities.
  Additionally, Pepr policies are implemented to prevent privilege escalation,
  ensuring that non-privileged users cannot gain unauthorized access to
  privileged functions. Istio Gateways further enhance security by segregating
  admin and user traffic to services within the system, ensuring that
  non-privileged users cannot interfere with administrative functions. These
  measures collectively enforce the principle of least privilege and protect
  privileged functions from unauthorized access, ensuring compliance with the
  control requirements.
