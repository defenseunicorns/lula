control-acronym: "[r5] AC-05"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Identify and document [Assignment: organization-defined duties of
  individuals requiring separation]; and

  b. Define system access authorizations to support separation of duties.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized
  privileges and helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without
  collusion. Separation of duties includes dividing mission or business
  functions and support functions among different individuals or roles,
  conducting system support functions with different individuals, and ensuring
  that security personnel who administer access control functions do not also
  administer audit functions. Because separation of duty violations can span
  systems and application domains, organizations consider the entirety of
  systems and system components when developing policy on separation of duties.
  Separation of duties is enforced through the account management activities in
  AC-2, access control mechanisms in AC-3, and identity management activities in
  IA-2, IA-4, and IA-12. Related Control(s): AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, AU-9, CM-5,
  CM-11, CP-9, IA-2, IA-4, IA-5, IA-12, MA-3, MA-5, PS-2, SA-8, SA-17.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing divisions
  of responsibility and separation of duties; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; list of divisions of responsibility and separation
  of duties; system access authorizations; system audit records; system security
  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  defining appropriate divisions of responsibility and separation of duties;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing separation of duties policy].

  UDS supports strong enforcement of separation of duties through comprehensive
  Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC). Keycloak provides centralized identity
  management, enabling administrators to clearly define and assign distinct
  roles (e.g., system administrator versus auditor) to prevent unrestricted
  control by any single individual. Kubernetes RBAC complements this by further
  isolating responsibilities, allowing precise segregation of duties such as
  application deployment, infrastructure management, and security configuration
  among distinct users and service accounts. Additionally, Istio Service Mesh
  gateways and authorization policies can be configured to strictly separate
  administrative management functions from general user or operational traffic.
  Collectively, these technical mechanisms enable robust enforcement of duty
  separation, ensuring critical functions require collaboration or are
  restricted to specifically authorized roles. 

  UDS provides technical capabilities to enforce documented organizational
  requirements for separation of duties through its integrated Role-Based Access
  Control (RBAC) mechanisms. Specifically, Keycloak supports clearly defined and
  documented administrator roles such as system administration, security
  auditing, and application management ensuring responsibilities are explicitly
  separated and documented in accordance with organizational policies.
  Additionally, Kubernetes RBAC provides granular control to clearly document
  and enforce the distinct responsibilities of personnel or service accounts
  related to system management, application deployment, and security
  configuration. Istio Service Mesh further complements this by enabling
  documented traffic management policies, clearly distinguishing administrative
  functions from operational user traffic.

  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: AC-5.1, AC-5.2, AC-5.3; as well as the following Rev. 5 security
  requirements: CCI-003684. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because of the addition of a new security requirement to the
  assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed: CCI-003684."
