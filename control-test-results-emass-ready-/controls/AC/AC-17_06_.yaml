control-acronym: "[r5] AC-17(06)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Protect information about remote access mechanisms from unauthorized use and
  disclosure.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Remote access to organizational information by non-organizational entities can
  increase the risk of unauthorized use and disclosure about remote access
  mechanisms. The organization considers including remote access requirements in
  the information exchange agreements with other organizations, as applicable.
  Remote access requirements can also be included in rules of behavior (see
  PL-4) and access agreements (see PS-6). Related Control(s): AT-2, AT-3, PS-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing remote
  access to the system; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  implementing or monitoring remote access to the system; system users with
  knowledge of information about remote access mechanisms; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].
