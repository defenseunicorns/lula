  Description:

  Enforce [Assignment: organization-defined discretionary access control policy]
  over the set of covered subjects and objects specified in the policy, and
  where the policy specifies that a subject that has been granted access to
  information can do one or more of the following:

  (a) Pass the information to any other subjects or objects;

  (b) Grant its privileges to other subjects;

  (c) Change security attributes on subjects, objects, the system, or the
  systemâ€™s components;

  (d) Choose the security attributes to be associated with newly created or
  revised objects; or

  (e) Change the rules governing access control.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not
  constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for
  which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been
  granted access to information are not prevented from passing the information
  to other subjects or objects (i.e., subjects have the discretion to pass).
  Discretionary access control can operate in conjunction with mandatory access
  control as described in AC-3(3) and AC-3(15). A subject that is constrained in
  its operation by mandatory access control policies can still operate under the
  less rigorous constraints of discretionary access control. Therefore, while
  AC-3(3) imposes constraints that prevent a subject from passing information to
  another subject operating at a different impact or classification level,
  AC-3(4) permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same
  impact or classification level. The policy is bounded by the system. Once the
  information is passed outside of system control, additional means may be
  required to ensure that the constraints remain in effect. While traditional
  definitions of discretionary access control require identity-based access
  control, that limitation is not required for this particular use of
  discretionary access control. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; discretionary access control
  policies; procedures addressing access enforcement; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  list of subjects and objects (i.e., users and resources) requiring enforcement
  of discretionary access control policies; system audit records; system
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with access enforcement
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing discretionary access control
  policy].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: AC-3(4).1,
  AC-3(4).2, AC-3(4).3. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant
  because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test
  result/compliance statement: AC-3(4).1, AC-3(4).2, AC-3(4).3.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS primarily implements role-based
  access control (RBAC) rather than discretionary access control (DAC). There is
  no user-driven file permission model within the container platform for
  end-users; access decisions are centrally enforced by system policy
  (Keycloak/Istio), not at the discretion of individual users. Thus, DAC
  policies are not applicable to this stack.)
