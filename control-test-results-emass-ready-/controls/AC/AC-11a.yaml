control-acronym: "[r5] AC-11"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Prevent further access to the system by [Selection (one or more):
  initiating a device lock after [Assignment: organization-defined time period]
  of inactivity; requiring the user to initiate a device lock before leaving the
  system unattended]; and

  b. Retain the device lock until the user reestablishes access using
  established identification and authentication procedures.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Device locks are temporary actions taken to prevent logical access to
  organizational systems when users stop work and move away from the immediate
  vicinity of those systems but do not want to log out because of the temporary
  nature of their absences. Device locks can be implemented at the operating
  system level or at the application level. A proximity lock may be used to
  initiate the device lock (e.g., via a Bluetooth-enabled device or dongle).
  User-initiated device locking is behavior or policy-based and, as such,
  requires users to take physical action to initiate the device lock. Device
  locks are not an acceptable substitute for logging out of systems, such as
  when organizations require users to log out at the end of workdays. Related

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing session
  lock; procedures addressing identification and authentication; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  security plan; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing access control policy for session
  lock].

  Session lock (e.g., auto-locking an interactive session after inactivity) in a
  web context translates to session timeouts. Keycloak tokens and sessions have
  configurable timeouts for inactivity and maximum session lifespan. For
  example, if a user is logged into an application via UDS and is idle, their
  session token can expire after a set idle period, forcing re-authentication.

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.

  UDS enforces session locking after an organizationally defined period of user
  inactivity through its centralized identity management solution, Keycloak.
  Administrators explicitly configure session lock thresholds by navigating to
  the Keycloak administrative interface under Realm Settings → Tokens → SSO
  Session Idle Timeout, setting the desired inactivity timeout (e.g., 15
  minutes). Once configured, Keycloak automatically initiates a secure session
  lock upon reaching the inactivity threshold, preventing further user
  interaction without reauthentication. This automated enforcement ensures
  sessions remain protected during periods of user inactivity, fully satisfying
  this control requirement.
