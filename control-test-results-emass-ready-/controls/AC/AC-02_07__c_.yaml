control-acronym: "[r5] AC-02(07)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Establish and administer privileged user accounts in accordance with
  [Selection: a role-based access scheme; an attribute-based access scheme];

  (b) Monitor privileged role or attribute assignments;

  (c) Monitor changes to roles or attributes; and

  (d) Revoke access when privileged role or attribute assignments are no longer
  appropriate.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals that
  allow those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that
  ordinary users are not authorized to perform. Privileged roles include key
  management, account management, database administration, system and network
  administration, and web administration. A role-based access scheme organizes
  permitted system access and privileges into roles. In contrast, an
  attribute-based access scheme specifies allowed system access and privileges
  based on attributes. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; system design documentation; system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; system-generated list of privileged user accounts
  and associated roles; records of actions taken when privileged role
  assignments are no longer appropriate; system audit records; audit tracking
  and monitoring reports; system monitoring records; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing account management functions;
  mechanisms monitoring privileged role assignments].
