control-acronym: "[r5] AC-20(03)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Restrict the use of non-organizationally owned systems or system components to
  process, store, or transmit organizational information using [Assignment:
  organization-defined restrictions].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Non-organizationally owned systems or system components include systems or
  system components owned by other organizations as well as personally owned
  devices. There are potential risks to using non-organizationally owned systems
  or components. In some cases, the risk is sufficiently high as to prohibit
  such use (see AC-20 b.). In other cases, the use of such systems or system
  components may be allowed but restricted in some way. Restrictions include
  requiring the implementation of approved controls prior to authorizing the
  connection of non-organizationally owned systems and components; limiting
  access to types of information, services, or applications; using
  virtualization techniques to limit processing and storage activities to
  servers or system components provisioned by the organization; and agreeing to
  the terms and conditions for usage. Organizations consult with the Office of
  the General Counsel regarding legal issues associated with using personally
  owned devices, including requirements for conducting forensic analyses during
  investigations after an incident. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing the use of
  external systems; system design documentation; system configuration settings
  and associated documentation; system connection or processing agreements;
  account management documents; system audit records, other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  restricting or prohibiting the use of non-organizationally owned systems,
  system components, or devices; system/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing restrictions on the use of
  non-organizationally owned systems, components, or devices].

  UDS from personal or external devices, or terms of use for external system
  connections, must be handled by policy. UDS does not inherently enforce
  device-specific rules beyond standard network access control. The expectation
  is that the hosting environmentâ€™s policies prevent unauthorized external
  system use.)
