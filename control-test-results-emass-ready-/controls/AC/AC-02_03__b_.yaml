control-acronym: "[r5] AC-02(03)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Disable accounts within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when
  the accounts:

  (a) Have expired;

  (b) Are no longer associated with a user or individual;

  (c) Are in violation of organizational policy; or

  (d) Have been inactive for [Assignment: organization-defined time period].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Disabling expired, inactive, or otherwise anomalous accounts supports the
  concepts of least privilege and least functionality which reduce the attack
  surface of the system. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures for addressing
  account management; system security plan; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system-generated list of
  accounts removed; system-generated list of emergency accounts disabled; system
  audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms for implementing account management functions].
