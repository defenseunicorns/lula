control-acronym: "[r5] AC-17(09)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Provide the capability to disconnect or disable remote access to the system
  within [Assignment: organization-defined time period].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The speed of system disconnect or disablement varies based on the criticality
  of missions or business functions and the need to eliminate immediate or
  future remote access to systems. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing
  disconnecting or disabling remote access to the system; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  security plan, system audit records; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing capability to disconnect or
  disable remote access to system].
