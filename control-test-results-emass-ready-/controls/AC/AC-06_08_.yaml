control-acronym: "[r5] AC-06(08)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Prevent the following software from executing at higher privilege levels than
  users executing the software: [Assignment: organization-defined software].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  In certain situations, software applications or programs need to execute with
  elevated privileges to perform required functions. However, depending on the
  software functionality and configuration, if the privileges required for
  execution are at a higher level than the privileges assigned to organizational
  users invoking such applications or programs, those users may indirectly be
  provided with greater privileges than assigned. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing least
  privilege; list of software that should not execute at higher privilege levels
  than users executing software; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  defining least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing least privilege functions for
  software execution].

  UDS prevents unauthorized execution of software at higher privilege levels
  through multiple integrated security mechanisms. Specifically, Kubernetes
  employs built-in security policies and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to
  explicitly define and enforce the privileges under which software executes,
  ensuring containerized applications do not run with privileges exceeding those
  granted to the user deploying or managing the software. UDS enforces a Pepr
  policy that prevents privilege escalation for pods running within the system,
  ensuring that software does not execute at higher privilege levels than the
  users executing the software. Additionally, UDS implements Security Technical
  Implementation Guides (STIGs) at the operating system layer to ensure that
  applications cannot run with elevated privileges beyond those assigned to the
  users invoking them. These measures collectively prevent organization-defined
  software from executing at higher privilege levels than users, in compliance
  with the control requirements.
