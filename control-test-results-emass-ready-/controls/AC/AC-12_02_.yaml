control-information: >-
  Description:

  Display an explicit logout message to users indicating the termination of
  authenticated communications sessions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Logout messages for web access can be displayed after authenticated sessions
  have been terminated. However, for certain types of sessions, including file
  transfer protocol (FTP) sessions, systems typically send logout messages as
  final messages prior to terminating sessions. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing session
  termination; user logout messages; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit records;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: System session termination mechanisms; display of logout
  messages].


  Statement of Weakness:

test-results: Within UDS, when a user clicks "logout," they receive a
  confirmation prompt. Once confirmed, Keycloak terminates the user's session.
  Because Keycloak functions as the centralized Single Sign-On (SSO) provider
  for all UDS applications, logging out of Keycloak results in the user being
  signed out of the entire system.
