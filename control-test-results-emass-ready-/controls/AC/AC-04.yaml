  Description:

  Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within
  the system and between connected systems based on [Assignment:
  organization-defined information flow control policies].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information flow control regulates where information can travel within a
  system and between systems (in contrast to who is allowed to access the
  information) and without regard to subsequent accesses to that information.
  Flow control restrictions include blocking external traffic that claims to be
  from within the organization, keeping export-controlled information from being
  transmitted in the clear to the Internet, restricting web requests that are
  not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers
  between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring
  information between organizations may require an agreement specifying how the
  information flow is enforced (see CA-3). Transferring information between
  systems in different security or privacy domains with different security or
  privacy policies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more
  domain security or privacy policies. In such situations, information
  owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points
  between connected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific
  architectural solutions to enforce specific security and privacy policies.
  Enforcement includes prohibiting information transfers between connected
  systems (i.e., allowing access only), verifying write permissions before
  accepting information from another security or privacy domain or connected
  system, employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows,
  and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security or
  privacy attributes and labels.


  Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and
  enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated
  sources and destinations within systems and between connected systems. Flow
  control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the
  information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection
  devices that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that
  restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on
  header information, or provide a message-filtering capability based on message
  content. Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and/or
  inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that
  are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through
  32 primarily address cross-domain solution needs that focus on more advanced
  filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement
  mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, such as high-assurance
  guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial
  off-the-shelf products. Information flow enforcement also applies to control
  plane traffic (e.g., routing and DNS). Related Control(s): AC-3, AC-6, AC-16,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: AC-4.1, AC-4.2,
  AC-4.3, AC-4.4, AC-4.5, AC-4.6. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally
  entered test result/compliance statement: AC-4.1.


  Collectively, these technologies enforce critical security controls such as
  encryption, authentication, monitoring, and anomaly detection to prevent
  unauthorized data disclosures. The organization defines and documents the
  information systems or system components that are to provide these security
  safeguards, ensuring compliance with AC-3(9) of NIST 800-53 Rev 4.

  For interconnected systems, AC-4 extends to controlling how data flows between
  UDS and external or federated systems, ensuring only authorized and properly
  secured exchanges occur. UDS enforces strong ingress and egress controls
  through Istio Ingress/Egress Gateways, NeuVector's Layer-7 firewalling, and
  Pepr/Kubernetes NetworkPolicies, restricting unauthorized external access.
  Authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as Keycloak federated
  authentication, Istio JWT validation, and mTLS, ensure service-to-service
  communication is cryptographically verified.

  UDS information flow control policies are achieved through network
  segmentation and service mesh policies. Istio can implement policies that
  restrict services from talking to each other except as allowed (for example,
  service A cannot call database B unless a policy allows it). Also, NeuVector
  provides Layer-7 firewalling between containers, so even if Kubernetes
  networking would allow two pods to communicate, NeuVector can block flows that
  violate defined security policies or that are not part of a learned normal
  behavior. This means UDS can enforce that data only flows between components
  that should exchange information. UDS covers typical use cases (e.g.,
  preventing a dev namespace service from contacting a prod database) via
  network policy, but it does not inherently label data or enforce policy by
  data content. UDS meets the core intent (network-level info flow control) by
  segmenting and gating traffic.
