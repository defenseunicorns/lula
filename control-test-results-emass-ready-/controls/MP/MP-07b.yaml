control-acronym: "[r5] MP-07"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. [Selection: Restrict; Prohibit] the use of [Assignment:
  organization-defined types of system media] on [Assignment:
  organization-defined systems or system components] using [Assignment:
  organization-defined controls]; and

  b. Prohibit the use of portable storage devices in organizational systems when
  such devices have no identifiable owner.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  System media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital media
  includes diskettes, magnetic tapes, flash drives, compact discs, digital
  versatile discs, and removable hard disk drives. Non-digital media includes
  paper and microfilm. Media use protections also apply to mobile devices with
  information storage capabilities. In contrast to MP-2, which restricts user
  access to media, MP-7 restricts the use of certain types of media on systems,
  for example, restricting or prohibiting the use of flash drives or external
  hard disk drives. Organizations use technical and nontechnical controls to
  restrict the use of system media. Organizations may restrict the use of
  portable storage devices, for example, by using physical cages on workstations
  to prohibit access to certain external ports or disabling or removing the
  ability to insert, read, or write to such devices. Organizations may also
  limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices, including
  devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other approved
  organizations, and devices that are not personally owned. Finally,
  organizations may restrict the use of portable storage devices based on the
  type of device, such as by prohibiting the use of writeable, portable storage
  devices and implementing this restriction by disabling or removing the
  capability to write to such devices. Requiring identifiable owners for storage
  devices reduces the risk of using such devices by allowing organizations to
  assign responsibility for addressing known vulnerabilities in the devices.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System media protection policy; system use policy;
  procedures addressing media usage restrictions; rules of behavior; system
  design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system media use
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for media use; mechanisms
  restricting or prohibiting the use of system media on systems or system
  components].
