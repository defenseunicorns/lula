  Description:

  a. Sanitize [Assignment: organization-defined system media] prior to disposal,
  release out of organizational control, or release for reuse using [Assignment:
  organization-defined sanitization techniques and procedures]; and

  b. Employ sanitization mechanisms with the strength and integrity commensurate
  with the security category or classification of the information.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Media sanitization applies to all digital and non-digital system media subject
  to disposal or reuse, whether or not the media is considered removable.
  Examples include digital media in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook
  computers, workstations, network components, mobile devices, and non-digital
  media (e.g., paper and microfilm). The sanitization process removes
  information from system media such that the information cannot be retrieved or
  reconstructed. Sanitization techniques—including clearing, purging,
  cryptographic erase, de-identification of personally identifiable information,
  and destruction—prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized
  individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal. Organizations
  determine the appropriate sanitization methods, recognizing that destruction
  is sometimes necessary when other methods cannot be applied to media requiring
  sanitization. Organizations use discretion on the employment of approved
  sanitization techniques and procedures for media that contains information
  deemed to be in the public domain or publicly releasable or information deemed
  to have no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for
  reuse or disposal. Sanitization of non-digital media includes destruction,
  removing a classified appendix from an otherwise unclassified document, or
  redacting selected sections or words from a document by obscuring the redacted
  sections or words in a manner equivalent in effectiveness to removing them
  from the document. NSA standards and policies control the sanitization process
  for media that contains classified information. NARA policies control the
  sanitization process for controlled unclassified information. Related

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System media protection policy; procedures addressing
  media sanitization and disposal; applicable federal standards and policies
  addressing media sanitization policy; media sanitization records; system audit
  records; system design documentation; records retention and disposition
  policy; records retention and disposition procedures; system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; system security plan; privacy plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with media sanitization
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with records retention and
  disposition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for media sanitization;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing media sanitization].
