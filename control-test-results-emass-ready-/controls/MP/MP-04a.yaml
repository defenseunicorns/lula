control-acronym: "[r5] MP-04"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Physically control and securely store [Assignment: organization-defined
  types of digital and/or non-digital media] within [Assignment:
  organization-defined controlled areas]; and

  b. Protect system media types defined in MP-4a until the media are destroyed
  or sanitized using approved equipment, techniques, and procedures.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  System media includes digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes
  flash drives, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable hard disk
  drives (e.g., solid state, magnetic), compact discs, and digital versatile
  discs. Non-digital media includes paper and microfilm. Physically controlling
  stored media includes conducting inventories, ensuring procedures are in place
  to allow individuals to check out and return media to the library, and
  maintaining accountability for stored media. Secure storage includes a locked
  drawer, desk, or cabinet or a controlled media library. The type of media
  storage is commensurate with the security category or classification of the
  information on the media. Controlled areas are spaces that provide physical
  and procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting
  information and systems. Fewer controls may be needed for media that contains
  information determined to be in the public domain, publicly releasable, or
  have limited adverse impacts on organizations, operations, or individuals if
  accessed by other than authorized personnel. In these situations, physical
  access controls provide adequate protection. Related Control(s): AC-19, CP-2,
  CP-6, CP-9, CP-10, MP-2, MP-7, PE-3, PL-2, SC-12, SC-13, SC-28, SC-34, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System media protection policy; procedures addressing
  media storage; physical and environmental protection policy and procedures;
  access control policy and procedures; system media; designated controlled
  areas; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system media protection
  and storage responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for storing information media;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing secure media storage/media
  protection].

  Determine if:

  - [Assignment: organization-defined types of digital and/or non-digital media]
  are physically controlled.

  - [Assignment: organization-defined types of digital and/or non-digital media]
  are securely stored within [Assignment: organization-defined controlled
  areas].
