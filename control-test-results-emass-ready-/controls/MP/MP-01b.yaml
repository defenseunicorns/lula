control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop, document, and disseminate to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles]:

  1. [Selection (one or more): Organization-level; Mission/business
  process-level; System-level] media protection policy that:
    (a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
    (b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and
  2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the media protection policy
  and the associated media protection controls;

  b. Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the
  development, documentation, and dissemination of the media protection policy
  and procedures; and

  c. Review and update the current media protection:

  1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events]; and

  2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Media protection policy and procedures address the controls in the MP family
  that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management
  strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures.
  Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance.
  Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on
  the development of media protection policy and procedures. Security and
  privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are
  preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or
  system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of
  the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies
  that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be
  established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business
  processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or
  controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is
  the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security
  and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may
  precipitate an update to media protection policy and procedures include
  assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in
  applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies,
  standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an
  organizational policy or procedure. Related Control(s): PM-9, PS-8, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Media protection policy and procedures; organizational
  risk management strategy; system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with media protection
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities].
