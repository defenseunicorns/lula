control-acronym: "[r5] MP-05"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Protect and control [Assignment: organization-defined types of system
  media] during transport outside of controlled areas using [Assignment:
  organization-defined controls];

  b. Maintain accountability for system media during transport outside of
  controlled areas;

  c. Document activities associated with the transport of system media; and

  d. Restrict the activities associated with the transport of system media to
  authorized personnel.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  System media includes digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes
  flash drives, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable hard disk
  drives (e.g., solid state and  magnetic), compact discs, and digital versatile
  discs. Non-digital media includes microfilm and paper. Controlled areas are
  spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet
  requirements established for protecting information and systems. Controls to
  protect media during transport include cryptography and locked containers.
  Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and integrity protections
  depending on the mechanisms implemented. Activities associated with media
  transport include releasing media for transport, ensuring that media enters
  the appropriate transport processes, and the actual transport. Authorized
  transport and courier personnel may include individuals external to the
  organization. Maintaining accountability of media during transport includes
  restricting transport activities to authorized personnel and tracking and/or
  obtaining records of transport activities as the media moves through the
  transportation system to prevent and detect loss, destruction, or tampering.
  Organizations establish documentation requirements for activities associated
  with the transport of system media in accordance with organizational
  assessments of risk. Organizations maintain the flexibility to define
  record-keeping methods for the different types of media transport as part of a
  system of transport-related records. Related Control(s): AC-7, AC-19, CP-2,
  CP-9, MP-3, MP-4, PE-16, PL-2, SC-12, SC-13, SC-28, SC-34.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System media protection policy; procedures addressing
  media storage; physical and environmental protection policy and procedures;
  access control policy and procedures; authorized personnel list; system media;
  designated controlled areas; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system media protection
  and storage responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for storing information media;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing media storage/media protection].
