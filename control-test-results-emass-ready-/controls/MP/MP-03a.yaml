control-acronym: "[r5] MP-03"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Mark system media indicating the distribution limitations, handling
  caveats, and applicable security markings (if any) of the information; and

  b. Exempt [Assignment: organization-defined types of system media] from
  marking if the media remain within [Assignment: organization-defined
  controlled areas].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Security marking refers to the application or use of human-readable security
  attributes. Digital media includes diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or
  removable hard disk drives (e.g., solid state, magnetic), flash drives,
  compact discs, and digital versatile discs. Non-digital media includes paper
  and microfilm. Controlled unclassified information is defined by the National
  Archives and Records Administration along with the appropriate safeguarding
  and dissemination requirements for such information and is codified in 32 CFR
  2002. Security markings are generally not required for media that contains
  information determined by organizations to be in the public domain or to be
  publicly releasable. Some organizations may require markings for public
  information indicating that the information is publicly releasable. System
  media marking reflects applicable laws, executive orders, directives,
  policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Related Control(s): AC-16,
  CP-9, MP-5, PE-22, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System media protection policy; procedures addressing
  media marking; physical and environmental protection policy and procedures;
  list of system media marking security attributes; designated controlled areas;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system media protection
  and marking responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for marking information media;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing media marking].
