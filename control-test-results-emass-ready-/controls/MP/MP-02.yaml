control-acronym: "[r5] MP-02"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Restrict access to [Assignment: organization-defined types of digital and/or
  non-digital media] to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  System media includes digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes
  flash drives, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external or removable hard disk
  drives (e.g., solid state, magnetic), compact discs, and digital versatile
  discs. Non-digital media includes paper and microfilm. Denying access to
  patient medical records in a community hospital unless the individuals seeking
  access to such records are authorized healthcare providers is an example of
  restricting access to non-digital media. Limiting access to the design
  specifications stored on compact discs in the media library to individuals on
  the system development team is an example of restricting access to digital
  media. Related Control(s): AC-19, AU-9, CP-2, CP-9, CP-10, MA-5, MP-4, MP-6,
  PE-2, PE-3, SC-12, SC-13, SC-34, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System media protection policy; procedures addressing
  media access restrictions; access control policy and procedures; physical and
  environmental protection policy and procedures; media storage facilities;
  access control records; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system media protection
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for restricting information
  media; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing media access restrictions].
