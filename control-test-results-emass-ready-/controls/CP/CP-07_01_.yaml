control-acronym: "[r5] CP-07(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Identify an alternate processing site that is sufficiently separated from the
  primary processing site to reduce susceptibility to the same threats.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Threats that affect alternate processing sites are defined in organizational
  assessments of risk and include natural disasters, structural failures,
  hostile attacks, and errors of omission or commission. Organizations determine
  what is considered a sufficient degree of separation between primary and
  alternate processing sites based on the types of threats that are of concern.
  For threats such as hostile attacks, the degree of separation between sites is
  less relevant. Related Control(s): RA-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  alternate processing sites; contingency plan; alternate processing site;
  alternate processing site agreements; primary processing site agreements;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency plan
  alternate processing site responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  system recovery responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].
