control-information: >-
  Description:

  Identify potential accessibility problems to the alternate storage site in the
  event of an area-wide disruption or disaster and outline explicit mitigation
  actions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Area-wide disruptions refer to those types of disruptions that are broad in
  geographic scope with such determinations made by organizations based on
  organizational assessments of risk. Explicit mitigation actions include
  duplicating backup information at other alternate storage sites if access
  problems occur at originally designated alternate sites or planning for
  physical access to retrieve backup information if electronic accessibility to
  the alternate site is disrupted. Related Control(s): RA-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  alternate storage sites; contingency plan; alternate storage site; list of
  potential accessibility problems to alternate storage site; mitigation actions
  for accessibility problems to alternate storage site; organizational risk
  assessments; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency plan
  alternate storage site responsibilities; organizational personnel with system
  recovery responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].

  Determine if:

  - potential accessibility problems to the alternate storage site in the event
  of an area-wide disruption or disaster are identified.

  - explicit mitigation actions to address identified accessibility problems are
  outlined.

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: CP-6(3).1,
  CP-6(3).2. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test
  result/compliance statement: CP-6(3).2.


  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (If an alternate storage site is
  needed for data, thatâ€™s an organizational decision. UDS can send backups
  offsite via Velero if configured, but selection and preparation of an
  alternate site is organizational.)
