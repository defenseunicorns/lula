control-information: >-
  Description:

  Test backup information [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to verify
  media reliability and information integrity.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations need assurance that backup information can be reliably
  retrieved. Reliability pertains to the systems and system components where the
  backup information is stored, the operations used to retrieve the information,
  and the integrity of the information being retrieved. Independent and
  specialized tests can be used for each of the aspects of reliability. For
  example, decrypting and transporting (or transmitting) a random sample of
  backup files from the alternate storage or backup site and comparing the
  information to the same information at the primary processing site can provide
  such assurance. Related Control(s): CP-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  system backup; contingency plan; system backup test results; contingency plan
  test documentation; contingency plan test results; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system backup
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for conducting system backups;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing system backups].
