  Description:

  a. Provide contingency training to system users consistent with assigned roles
  and responsibilities:

  1. Within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of assuming a
  contingency role or responsibility;

  2. When required by system changes; and

  3. [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] thereafter; and

  b. Review and update contingency training content [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] and following [Assignment:
  organization-defined events].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Contingency training provided by organizations is linked to the assigned roles
  and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure that the
  appropriate content and level of detail is included in such training. For
  example, some individuals may only need to know when and where to report for
  duty during contingency operations and if normal duties are affected; system
  administrators may require additional training on how to establish systems at
  alternate processing and storage sites; and organizational officials may
  receive more specific training on how to conduct mission-essential functions
  in designated off-site locations and how to establish communications with
  other governmental entities for purposes of coordination on
  contingency-related activities. Training for contingency roles or
  responsibilities reflects the specific continuity requirements in the
  contingency plan. Events that may precipitate an update to contingency
  training content include, but are not limited to, contingency plan testing or
  an actual contingency (lessons learned), assessment or audit findings,
  security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders,
  directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. At the
  discretion of the organization, participation in a contingency plan test or
  exercise, including lessons learned sessions subsequent to the test or
  exercise, may satisfy contingency plan training requirements. Related

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  contingency training; contingency plan; contingency training curriculum;
  contingency training material; contingency training records; system security
  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency planning,
  plan implementation, and training responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for contingency training].
