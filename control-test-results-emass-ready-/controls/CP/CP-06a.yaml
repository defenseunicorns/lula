control-acronym: "[r5] CP-06"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Establish an alternate storage site, including necessary agreements to
  permit the storage and retrieval of system backup information; and

  b. Ensure that the alternate storage site provides controls equivalent to that
  of the primary site.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Alternate storage sites are geographically distinct from primary storage sites
  and maintain duplicate copies of information and data if the primary storage
  site is not available. Similarly, alternate processing sites provide
  processing capability if the primary processing site is not available.
  Geographically distributed architectures that support contingency requirements
  may be considered alternate storage sites. Items covered by alternate storage
  site agreements include environmental conditions at the alternate sites,
  access rules for systems and facilities, physical and environmental protection
  requirements, and coordination of delivery and retrieval of backup media.
  Alternate storage sites reflect the requirements in contingency plans so that
  organizations can maintain essential mission and business functions despite
  compromise, failure, or disruption in organizational systems. Related

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  alternate storage sites; contingency plan; alternate storage site agreements;
  primary storage site agreements; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency plan
  alternate storage site responsibilities; organizational personnel with system
  recovery responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for storing and retrieving system
  backup information at the alternate storage site; mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing the storage and retrieval of system backup information at the
  alternate storage site].
