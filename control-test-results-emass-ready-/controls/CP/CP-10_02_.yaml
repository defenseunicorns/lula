  Description:

  Implement transaction recovery for systems that are transaction-based.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Transaction-based systems include database management systems and transaction
  processing systems. Mechanisms supporting transaction recovery include
  transaction rollback and transaction journaling. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  system recovery and reconstitution; contingency plan; system design
  documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  contingency plan test documentation; contingency plan test results; system
  transaction recovery records; system audit records; system security plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  transaction recovery; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing transaction
  recovery capability].

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS is primarily a
  containerized DevSecOps deployment environment and infrastructure management
  solution. It does not inherently implement or manage transactional database
  operations or other transactional processing systems requiring explicit
  transaction recovery mechanisms. Transaction recovery, if required, would
  typically be addressed at the individual application or database component
  level, outside the core functionality provided by UDS itself.)
