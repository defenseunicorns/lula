control-information: >-
  Description:

  Plan for the resumption of [Selection: all; essential] mission and business
  functions within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of contingency
  plan activation.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations may choose to conduct contingency planning activities to resume
  mission and business functions as part of business continuity planning or as
  part of business impact analyses. Organizations prioritize the resumption of
  mission and business functions. The time period for resuming mission and
  business functions may be dependent on the severity and extent of the
  disruptions to the system and its supporting infrastructure. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  contingency operations for the system; contingency plan; business impact
  assessment; system security plan; privacy plan; other related plans; system
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency planning
  and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security and privacy responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with knowledge of requirements for mission and business functions].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for resumption of missions and
  business functions].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: CP-2(3).1,
  CP-2(3).2, CP-2(3).3, CP-2(3).4. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally
  entered test result/compliance statement: CP-2(3).3, CP-2(3).4.


  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Organizational contingency plans are
  outside the scope of UDS. UDS provides tools to execute recovery but the plan
  documentation is an organizational responsibility as it is custom to their
  mission.)
