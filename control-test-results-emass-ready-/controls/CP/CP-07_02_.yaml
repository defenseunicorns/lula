  Description:

  Identify potential accessibility problems to alternate processing sites in the
  event of an area-wide disruption or disaster and outlines explicit mitigation
  actions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Area-wide disruptions refer to those types of disruptions that are broad in
  geographic scope with such determinations made by organizations based on
  organizational assessments of risk. Related Control(s): RA-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  alternate processing sites; contingency plan; alternate processing site;
  alternate processing site agreements; primary processing site agreements;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency plan
  alternate processing site responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  system recovery responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].
