control-acronym: "[r5] CP-08(02)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Obtain alternate telecommunications services to reduce the likelihood of
  sharing a single point of failure with primary telecommunications services.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  In certain circumstances, telecommunications service providers or services may
  share the same physical lines, which increases the vulnerability of a single
  failure point. It is important to have provider transparency for the actual
  physical transmission capability for telecommunication services. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  primary and alternate telecommunications services; contingency plan; primary
  and alternate telecommunications service agreements; system security plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency plan
  telecommunications responsibilities; organizational personnel with system
  recovery responsibilities; primary and alternate telecommunications service
  providers; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].
