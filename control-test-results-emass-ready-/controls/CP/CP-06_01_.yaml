control-information: >-
  Description:

  Identify an alternate storage site that is sufficiently separated from the
  primary storage site to reduce susceptibility to the same threats.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Threats that affect alternate storage sites are defined in organizational risk
  assessments and include natural disasters, structural failures, hostile
  attacks, and errors of omission or commission. Organizations determine what is
  considered a sufficient degree of separation between primary and alternate
  storage sites based on the types of threats that are of concern. For threats
  such as hostile attacks, the degree of separation between sites is less
  relevant. Related Control(s): RA-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  alternate storage sites; contingency plan; alternate storage site; alternate
  storage site agreements; primary storage site agreements; system security
  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency plan
  alternate storage site responsibilities; organizational personnel with system
  recovery responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].
