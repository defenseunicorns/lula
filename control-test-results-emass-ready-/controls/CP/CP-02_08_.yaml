  Description:

  Identify critical system assets supporting [Selection: all; essential] mission
  and business functions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations may choose to identify critical assets as part of criticality
  analysis, business continuity planning, or business impact analyses.
  Organizations identify critical system assets so that additional controls can
  be employed (beyond the controls routinely implemented) to help ensure that
  organizational mission and business functions can continue to be conducted
  during contingency operations. The identification of critical information
  assets also facilitates the prioritization of organizational resources.
  Critical system assets include technical and operational aspects. Technical
  aspects include system components, information technology services,
  information technology products, and mechanisms. Operational aspects include
  procedures (i.e., manually executed operations) and personnel (i.e.,
  individuals operating technical controls and/or executing manual procedures).
  Organizational program protection plans can assist in identifying critical
  assets. If critical assets are resident within or supported by external
  service providers, organizations consider implementing CP-2(7) as a control
  enhancement. Related Control(s): CM-8, RA-9.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  contingency operations for the system; contingency plan; business impact
  assessment; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency planning
  and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  knowledge of requirements for mission and business functions; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: CP-2(8).1,
  CP-2(8).2. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test
  result/compliance statement: CP-2(8).1, CP-2(8).2.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Organizational contingency plans are
  outside the scope of UDS. UDS provides tools to execute recovery but the plan
  documentation is an organizational responsibility as it is custom to their
  mission.)
