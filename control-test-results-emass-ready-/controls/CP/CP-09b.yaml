control-acronym: "[r5] CP-09"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Conduct backups of user-level information contained in [Assignment:
  organization-defined system components] [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives];

  b. Conduct backups of system-level information contained in the system
  [Assignment: organization-defined frequency consistent with recovery time and
  recovery point objectives];

  c. Conduct backups of system documentation, including security- and
  privacy-related documentation [Assignment: organization-defined frequency
  consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives]; and 

  d. Protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of backup
  information.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  System-level information includes system state information, operating system
  software, middleware, application software, and licenses. User-level
  information includes information other than system-level information.
  Mechanisms employed to protect the integrity of system backups include digital
  signatures and cryptographic hashes. Protection of system backup information
  while in transit is addressed by MP-5 and SC-8. System backups reflect the
  requirements in contingency plans as well as other organizational requirements
  for backing up information. Organizations may be subject to laws, executive
  orders, directives, regulations, or policies with requirements regarding
  specific categories of information (e.g., personal health information).
  Organizational personnel consult with the senior agency official for privacy
  and legal counsel regarding such requirements. Related Control(s): CP-2, CP-6,
  CP-10, MP-4, MP-5, SC-8, SC-12, SC-13, SI-4, SI-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  system backup; contingency plan; backup storage location(s); system backup
  logs or records; system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system backup
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for conducting system backups;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing system backups].

  UDS integrates Velero for backup and restore​. Velero is configured to
  routinely (typically weekly per implementation guidance) back up Kubernetes
  resources and any persistent data (such as databases or storage volumes used
  by UDS components). These backups can be stored within the cluster or exported
  to an external storage location, providing data redundancy. For example,
  Velero can take scheduled snapshots of Keycloak’s database and the state of
  applications. In an event of data loss or corruption, these backups are
  available to restore the system to a previous state.
