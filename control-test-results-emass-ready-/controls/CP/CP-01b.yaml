control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop, document, and disseminate to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles]:

  1. [Selection (one or more): Organization-level; Mission/business
  process-level; System-level] contingency planning policy that:
    (a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
    (b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and
  2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the contingency planning
  policy and the associated contingency planning controls;

  b. Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the
  development, documentation, and dissemination of the contingency planning
  policy and procedures; and

  c. Review and update the current contingency planning:

  1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events]; and

  2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Contingency planning policy and procedures address the controls in the CP
  family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk
  management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and
  procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy
  assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs
  collaborate on the development of contingency planning policy and procedures.
  Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level
  are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or
  system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of
  the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies
  that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be
  established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business
  processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or
  controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is
  the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security
  and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may
  precipitate an update to contingency planning policy and procedures include
  assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in
  laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and
  guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational
  policy or procedure. Related Control(s): PM-9, PS-8, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy and procedures; system
  security plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency planning
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities].
