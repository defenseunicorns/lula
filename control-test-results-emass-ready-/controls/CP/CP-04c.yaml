control-acronym: "[r5] CP-04"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Test the contingency plan for the system [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency] using the following tests to determine the effectiveness of the
  plan and the readiness to execute the plan: [Assignment: organization-defined
  tests].

  b. Review the contingency plan test results; and

  c. Initiate corrective actions, if needed.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Methods for testing contingency plans to determine the effectiveness of the
  plans and identify potential weaknesses include checklists, walk-through and
  tabletop exercises, simulations (parallel or full interrupt), and
  comprehensive exercises. Organizations conduct testing based on the
  requirements in contingency plans and include a determination of the effects
  on organizational operations, assets, and individuals due to contingency
  operations. Organizations have flexibility and discretion in the breadth,
  depth, and timelines of corrective actions. Related Control(s): AT-3, CP-2,
  CP-3, CP-8, CP-9, IR-3, IR-4, PL-2, PM-14, SR-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  contingency plan testing; contingency plan; contingency plan test
  documentation; contingency plan test results; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  contingency plan testing, reviewing, or responding to contingency plan tests;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for contingency plan testing;
  mechanisms supporting the contingency plan and/or contingency plan testing].
