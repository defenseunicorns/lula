  Description:

  Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and
  modification of [Assignment: organization-defined backup information].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect the
  confidentiality and integrity of backup information. The strength of
  mechanisms selected is commensurate with the security category or
  classification of the information. Cryptographic protection applies to system
  backup information in storage at both primary and alternate locations.
  Organizations that implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect information
  at rest also consider cryptographic key management solutions. Related
  Control(s): SC-12, SC-13, SC-28.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  system backup; contingency plan; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system security plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system backup
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing cryptographic
  protection of backup information].
