control-acronym: "[r5] CP-08"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Establish alternate telecommunications services, including necessary
  agreements to permit the resumption of [Assignment: organization-defined
  system operations] for essential mission and business functions within
  [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when the primary
  telecommunications capabilities are unavailable at either the primary or
  alternate processing or storage sites.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Telecommunications services (for data and voice) for primary and alternate
  processing and storage sites are in scope for CP-8. Alternate
  telecommunications services reflect the continuity requirements in contingency
  plans to maintain essential mission and business functions despite the loss of
  primary telecommunications services. Organizations may specify different time
  periods for primary or alternate sites. Alternate telecommunications services
  include additional organizational or commercial ground-based circuits or
  lines, network-based approaches to telecommunications, or the use of
  satellites. Organizations consider factors such as availability, quality of
  service, and access when entering into alternate telecommunications
  agreements. Related Control(s): CP-2, CP-6, CP-7, CP-11, SC-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  alternate telecommunications services; contingency plan; primary and alternate
  telecommunications service agreements; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency plan
  telecommunications responsibilities; organizational personnel with system
  recovery responsibilities; organizational personnel with knowledge of
  requirements for mission and business functions; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  responsibility for acquisitions/contractual agreements].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting telecommunications].
