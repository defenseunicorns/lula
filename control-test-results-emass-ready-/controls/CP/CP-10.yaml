control-information: >-
  Description:

  Provide for the recovery and reconstitution of the system to a known state
  within [Assignment: organization-defined time period consistent with recovery
  time and recovery point objectives] after a disruption, compromise, or
  failure.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Recovery is executing contingency plan activities to restore organizational
  mission and business functions. Reconstitution takes place following recovery
  and includes activities for returning systems to fully operational states.
  Recovery and reconstitution operations reflect mission and business
  priorities; recovery point, recovery time, and reconstitution objectives; and
  organizational metrics consistent with contingency plan requirements.
  Reconstitution includes the deactivation of interim system capabilities that
  may have been needed during recovery operations. Reconstitution also includes
  assessments of fully restored system capabilities, reestablishment of
  continuous monitoring activities, system reauthorization (if required), and
  activities to prepare the system and organization for future disruptions,
  breaches, compromises, or failures. Recovery and reconstitution capabilities
  can include automated mechanisms and manual procedures. Organizations
  establish recovery time and recovery point objectives as part of contingency
  planning. Related Control(s): CP-2, CP-4, CP-6, CP-7, CP-9, IR-4, SA-8, SC-24,
  SI-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  system backup; contingency plan; system backup test results; contingency plan
  test results; contingency plan test documentation; redundant secondary system
  for system backups; location(s) of redundant secondary backup system(s);
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency planning,
  recovery, and/or reconstitution responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes implementing system recovery and
  reconstitution operations; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing system
  recovery and reconstitution operations].

  Determine if:

  - the recovery of the system to a known state is provided within [Assignment:
  organization-defined time period consistent with recovery time and recovery
  point objectives] after a disruption, compromise, or failure.

  - a reconstitution of the system to a known state is provided within
  [Assignment: organization-defined time period consistent with recovery time
  and recovery point objectives] after a disruption, compromise, or failure.

test-results: In UDS, recovery and reconstitution after a disruption,
  compromise, or failure are achieved through a coordinated, automated process
  that restores the system to a known secure state. This is primarily managed
  using Infrastructure as Code with OpenTofu and Zarf, which ensure that the
  systemâ€™s baseline configuration and deployments are version-controlled and can
  be redeployed consistently. Velero plays a key role by regularly backing up
  Kubernetes resources and persistent data, allowing the system to be restored
  to a recent, known state in the event of data loss or corruption.
  Complementing these measures, monitoring and logging tools such as Prometheus,
  Grafana, and Loki provide real-time visibility to verify that the system state
  aligns with expected security baselines post-recovery. Together, these
  components enable UDS to rapidly recover and reconstitute the information
  system to a secure, operational state following disruptions.

  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: CP-10.1, CP-10.2, CP-10.3; as well as the following Rev. 5
  security requirements: CCI-004028, CCI-004029. The resulting compliance status
