control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Establish an alternate processing site, including necessary agreements to
  permit the transfer and resumption of [Assignment: organization-defined system
  operations] for essential mission and business functions within [Assignment:
  organization-defined time period consistent with recovery time and recovery
  point objectives] when the primary processing capabilities are unavailable;

  b. Make available at the alternate processing site, the equipment and supplies
  required to transfer and resume operations or put contracts in place to
  support delivery to the site within the organization-defined time period for
  transfer and resumption; and

  c. Provide controls at the alternate processing site that are equivalent to
  those at the primary site.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Alternate processing sites are geographically distinct from primary processing
  sites and provide processing capability if the primary processing site is not
  available. The alternate processing capability may be addressed using a
  physical processing site or other alternatives, such as failover to a
  cloud-based service provider or other internally or externally provided
  processing service. Geographically distributed architectures that support
  contingency requirements may also be considered alternate processing sites.
  Controls that are covered by alternate processing site agreements include the
  environmental conditions at alternate sites, access rules, physical and
  environmental protection requirements, and the coordination for the transfer
  and assignment of personnel. Requirements are allocated to alternate
  processing sites that reflect the requirements in contingency plans to
  maintain essential mission and business functions despite disruption,
  compromise, or failure in organizational systems. Related Control(s): CP-2,
  CP-6, CP-8, CP-9, CP-10, MA-6, PE-3, PE-11, PE-12, PE-17, SC-36, SI-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  alternate processing sites; contingency plan; alternate processing site
  agreements; primary processing site agreements; spare equipment and supplies
  inventory at alternate processing site; equipment and supply contracts;
  service-level agreements; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  contingency planning and/or alternate site arrangements; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for recovery at the alternate
  site; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing recovery at the alternate
  processing site].

implementation-guidance: CCI-000510 and CCI-002839 of this assessment procedure
  are automatically compliant because of coverage by DoD Enterprise.
assessment-procedures: "Determine if an alternate processing site, including
  necessary agreements to permit the transfer and resumption of [Assignment:
  organization-defined system operations] for essential mission and business
  functions, is established within [Assignment: organization-defined time period
  consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives] when the primary
  processing capabilities are unavailable."

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: CP-7.1, CP-7.2,
  CP-7.3, CP-7.4. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant
  because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test
  result/compliance statement: CP-7.4.


  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Similar to CP-6, having an alternate
  processing environment is an enterprise consideration. UDS could be
  re-deployed to an alternate site if needed, but managing that site is outside
  UDSâ€™s domain.)
