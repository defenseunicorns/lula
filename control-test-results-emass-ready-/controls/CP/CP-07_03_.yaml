  Description:

  Develop alternate processing site agreements that contain priority-of-service
  provisions in accordance with availability requirements (including recovery
  time objectives).


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Priority of service agreements refer to negotiated agreements with service
  providers that ensure that organizations receive priority treatment consistent
  with their availability requirements and the availability of information
  resources for logical alternate processing and/or at the physical alternate
  processing site. Organizations establish recovery time objectives as part of
  contingency planning. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  alternate processing sites; contingency plan; alternate processing site
  agreements; service-level agreements; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency plan
  alternate processing site responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  system recovery responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibility for
  acquisitions/contractual agreements].
