control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop a contingency plan for the system that:

  1. Identifies essential mission and business functions and associated
  contingency requirements;

  2. Provides recovery objectives, restoration priorities, and metrics;

  3. Addresses contingency roles, responsibilities, assigned individuals with
  contact information;

  4. Addresses maintaining essential mission and business functions despite a
  system disruption, compromise, or failure;

  5. Addresses eventual, full system restoration without deterioration of the
  controls originally planned and implemented;

  6. Addresses the sharing of contingency information; and

  7. Is reviewed and approved by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
  roles];

  b. Distribute copies of the contingency plan to [Assignment:
  organization-defined key contingency personnel (identified by name and/or by
  role) and organizational elements];

  c. Coordinate contingency planning activities with incident handling
  activities;

  d. Review the contingency plan for the system [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency];

  e. Update the contingency plan to address changes to the organization, system,
  or environment of operation and problems encountered during contingency plan
  implementation, execution, or testing;

  f. Communicate contingency plan changes to [Assignment: organization-defined
  key contingency personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and
  organizational elements];

  g. Incorporate lessons learned from contingency plan testing, training, or
  actual contingency activities into contingency testing and training; and

  h. Protect the contingency plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Contingency planning for systems is part of an overall program for achieving
  continuity of operations for organizational mission and business functions.
  Contingency planning addresses system restoration and implementation of
  alternative mission or business processes when systems are compromised or
  breached. Contingency planning is considered throughout the system development
  life cycle and is a fundamental part of the system design. Systems can be
  designed for redundancy, to provide backup capabilities, and for resilience.
  Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for
  organizational systems since not all systems need to fully recover to achieve
  the level of continuity of operations desired. System recovery objectives
  reflect applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies,
  standards, guidelines, organizational risk tolerance, and system impact level.


  Actions addressed in contingency plans include orderly system degradation,
  system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and
  operating in modes reserved for when systems are under attack. By coordinating
  contingency planning with incident handling activities, organizations ensure
  that the necessary planning activities are in place and activated in the event
  of an incident. Organizations consider whether continuity of operations during
  an incident conflicts with the capability to automatically disable the system,
  as specified in IR-4(5). Incident response planning is part of contingency
  planning for organizations and is addressed in the IR (Incident Response)
  family. Related Control(s): CP-3, CP-4, CP-6, CP-7, CP-8, CP-9, CP-10, CP-11,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  contingency operations for the system; contingency plan; evidence of
  contingency plan reviews and updates; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency planning
  and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  incident handling responsibilities; organizational personnel with knowledge of
  requirements for mission and business functions; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for contingency plan development,
  review, update, and protection; mechanisms for developing, reviewing,
  updating, and/or protecting the contingency plan].
