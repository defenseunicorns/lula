control-information: >-
  Description:

  Transfer system backup information to the alternate storage site [Assignment:
  organization-defined time period and transfer rate consistent with the
  recovery time and recovery point objectives].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  System backup information can be transferred to alternate storage sites either
  electronically or by the physical shipment of storage media. Related
  Control(s): CP-7, MP-3, MP-4, MP-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  system backup; contingency plan; system backup logs or records; evidence of
  system backup information transferred to alternate storage site; alternate
  storage site agreements; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system backup
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for transferring system backups
  to the alternate storage site; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  system backups; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing information transfer
  to the alternate storage site].
