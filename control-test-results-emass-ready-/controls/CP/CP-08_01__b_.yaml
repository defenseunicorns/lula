control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Develop primary and alternate telecommunications service agreements that
  contain priority-of-service provisions in accordance with availability
  requirements (including recovery time objectives); and

  (b) Request Telecommunications Service Priority for all telecommunications
  services used for national security emergency preparedness if the primary
  and/or alternate telecommunications services are provided by a common carrier.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations consider the potential mission or business impact in situations
  where telecommunications service providers are servicing other organizations
  with similar priority of service provisions. Telecommunications Service
  Priority (TSP) is a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) program that
  directs telecommunications service providers (e.g., wireline and wireless
  phone companies) to give preferential treatment to users enrolled in the
  program when they need to add new lines or have their lines restored following
  a disruption of service, regardless of the cause. The FCC sets the rules and
  policies for the TSP program, and the Department of Homeland Security manages
  the TSP program. The TSP program is always in effect and not contingent on a
  major disaster or attack taking place. Federal sponsorship is required to
  enroll in the TSP program. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing

  telecommunications responsibilities; organizational personnel with system
