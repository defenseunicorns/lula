control-acronym: "[r5] CP-04"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Test the contingency plan for the system [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency] using the following tests to determine the effectiveness of the
  plan and the readiness to execute the plan: [Assignment: organization-defined
  tests].

  b. Review the contingency plan test results; and

  c. Initiate corrective actions, if needed.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Methods for testing contingency plans to determine the effectiveness of the
  plans and identify potential weaknesses include checklists, walk-through and
  tabletop exercises, simulations (parallel or full interrupt), and
  comprehensive exercises. Organizations conduct testing based on the
  requirements in contingency plans and include a determination of the effects
  on organizational operations, assets, and individuals due to contingency
  operations. Organizations have flexibility and discretion in the breadth,
  depth, and timelines of corrective actions. Related Control(s): AT-3, CP-2,
  CP-3, CP-8, CP-9, IR-3, IR-4, PL-2, PM-14, SR-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  contingency plan testing; contingency plan; contingency plan test
  documentation; contingency plan test results; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  contingency plan testing, reviewing, or responding to contingency plan tests;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for contingency plan testing;
  mechanisms supporting the contingency plan and/or contingency plan testing].

  Determine if:

  - the contingency plan for the system is tested [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].

  - [Assignment: organization-defined tests] are used to determine the
  effectiveness of the plan.

  - [Assignment: organization-defined tests] are used to determine the readiness
  to execute the plan.

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: CP-4.1, CP-4.2,
  CP-4.3. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because the
  following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test
  result/compliance statement: CP-4.2, CP-4.3.


  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Organizational contingency plans are
  outside the scope of UDS. UDS provides tools to execute recovery but the plan
  documentation is an organizational responsibility as it is custom to their
  mission.)
