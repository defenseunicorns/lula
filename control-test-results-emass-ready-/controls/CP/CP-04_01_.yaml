  Description:

  Coordinate contingency plan testing with organizational elements responsible
  for related plans.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Plans related to contingency planning for organizational systems include
  Business Continuity Plans, Disaster Recovery Plans, Continuity of Operations
  Plans, Crisis Communications Plans, Critical Infrastructure Plans, Cyber
  Incident Response Plans, and Occupant Emergency Plans. Coordination of
  contingency plan testing does not require organizations to create
  organizational elements to handle related plans or to align such elements with
  specific plans. However, it does require that if such organizational elements
  are responsible for related plans, organizations coordinate with those
  elements. Related Control(s): IR-8, PM-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; incident response policy;
  procedures addressing contingency plan testing; contingency plan testing
  documentation; contingency plan; business continuity plans; disaster recovery
  plans; continuity of operations plans; crisis communications plans; critical

  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].
