control-acronym: "[r5] RA-01"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop, document, and disseminate to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles]:

  1. [Selection (one or more): Organization-level; Mission/business
  process-level; System-level] risk assessment policy that:
    (a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
    (b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and
  2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the risk assessment policy
  and the associated risk assessment controls;

  b. Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the
  development, documentation, and dissemination of the risk assessment policy
  and procedures; and

  c. Review and update the current risk assessment:

  1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events]; and

  2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Risk assessment policy and procedures address the controls in the RA family
  that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management
  strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures.
  Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance.
  Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on
  the development of risk assessment policy and procedures. Security and privacy
  program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in
  general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and
  procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and
  privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
  nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and
  privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if
  needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and
  can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
  Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or
  more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to risk
  assessment policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings,
  security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders,
  directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating
  controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure. Related
  Control(s): PM-9, PS-8, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Risk assessment policy and procedures; system security
  plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with risk assessment
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with security and privacy
  responsibilities].
