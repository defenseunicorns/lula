control-acronym: "[r5] RA-02"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Categorize the system and information it processes, stores, and transmits;

  b. Document the security categorization results, including supporting
  rationale, in the security plan for the system; and

  c. Verify that the authorizing official or authorizing official designated
  representative reviews and approves the security categorization decision.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Security categories describe the potential adverse impacts or negative
  consequences to organizational operations, organizational assets, and
  individuals if organizational information and systems are compromised through
  a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Security categorization
  is also a type of asset loss characterization in systems security engineering
  processes that is carried out throughout the system development life cycle.
  Organizations can use privacy risk assessments or privacy impact assessments
  to better understand the potential adverse effects on individuals. CNSSI 1253
  provides additional guidance on categorization for national security systems.


  Organizations conduct the security categorization process as an
  organization-wide activity with the direct involvement of chief information
  officers, senior agency information security officers, senior agency officials
  for privacy, system owners, mission and business owners, and information
  owners or stewards. Organizations consider the potential adverse impacts to
  other organizations and, in accordance with USA PATRIOT and Homeland Security
  Presidential Directives, potential national-level adverse impacts.


  Security categorization processes facilitate the development of inventories of
  information assets and, along with CM-8, mappings to specific system
  components where information is processed, stored, or transmitted. The
  security categorization process is revisited throughout the system development
  life cycle to ensure that the security categories remain accurate and
  relevant. Related Control(s): CM-8, MP-4, PL-2, PL-10, PL-11, PM-7, RA-3,
  RA-5, RA-7, RA-8, SA-8, SC-7, SC-38, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  procedures; procedures addressing security categorization of organizational
  information and systems; security categorization documentation; system

  and risk assessment responsibilities; organizational personnel with security
