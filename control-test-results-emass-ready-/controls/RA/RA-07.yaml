control-acronym: "[r5] RA-07"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Respond to findings from security and privacy assessments, monitoring, and
  audits in accordance with organizational risk tolerance.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations have many options for responding to risk including mitigating
  risk by implementing new controls or strengthening existing controls,
  accepting risk with appropriate justification or rationale, sharing or
  transferring risk, or avoiding risk. The risk tolerance of the organization
  influences risk response decisions and actions. Risk response addresses the
  need to determine an appropriate response to risk before generating a plan of
  action and milestones entry. For example, the response may be to accept risk
  or reject risk, or it may be possible to mitigate the risk immediately so that
  a plan of action and milestones entry is not needed. However, if the risk
  response is to mitigate the risk, and the mitigation cannot be completed
  immediately, a plan of action and milestones entry is generated. Related

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Risk assessment policy; assessment reports; audit
  records/event logs; system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with assessment and auditing
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  security and privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for assessments and audits;
  mechanisms/tools supporting and/or implementing assessments and auditing].
