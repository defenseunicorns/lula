control-acronym: "[r5] RA-03(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Assess supply chain risks associated with [Assignment:
  organization-defined systems, system components, and system services]; and

  (b) Update the supply chain risk assessment [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency], when there are significant changes to the relevant supply chain,
  or when changes to the system, environments of operation, or other conditions
  may necessitate a change in the supply chain.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Supply chain-related events include disruption, use of defective components,
  insertion of counterfeits, theft, malicious development practices, improper
  delivery practices, and insertion of malicious code. These events can have a
  significant impact on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a
  system and its information and, therefore, can also adversely impact
  organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or
  reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the
  Nation. The supply chain-related events may be unintentional or malicious and
  can occur at any point during the system life cycle. An analysis of supply
  chain risk can help an organization identify systems or components for which
  additional supply chain risk mitigations are required. Related Control(s):
  RA-2, RA-9, PM-17, PM-30, SR-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Supply chain risk management policy; inventory of
  critical systems, system components, and system services; risk assessment
  policy; security planning policy and procedures; procedures addressing
  organizational assessments of supply chain risk; risk assessment; risk
  assessment results; risk assessment reviews; risk assessment updates;
  acquisition policy; system security plan; supply chain risk management plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with risk assessment
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with security responsibilities;
  organizational personnel with supply chain risk management responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for risk assessment; mechanisms
  supporting and/or conducting, documenting, reviewing, disseminating, and
  updating the supply chain risk assessment].
