control-information: >-
  Description:

  Implement privileged access authorization to [Assignment: organization-defined
  system components] for [Assignment: organization-defined vulnerability
  scanning activities].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  In certain situations, the nature of the vulnerability scanning may be more
  intrusive, or the system component that is the subject of the scanning may
  contain classified or controlled unclassified information, such as personally
  identifiable information. Privileged access authorization to selected system
  components facilitates more thorough vulnerability scanning and protects the
  sensitive nature of such scanning. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Risk assessment policy; procedures addressing
  vulnerability scanning; system design documentation; system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; list of system components for
  vulnerability scanning; personnel access authorization list; authorization
  credentials; access authorization records; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with vulnerability scanning
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel
  responsible for access control to the system; organizational personnel
  responsible for configuration management of the system; system developers;
  organizational personnel with security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for vulnerability scanning;
  organizational processes for access control; mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing access control; mechanisms/tools supporting and/or implementing
  vulnerability scanning].

  UDS ensures that all vulnerability scanning software that requires privileged
  access to information system components is done following least privilege and
  done in a controlled manner through a specific role. For example if an
  authenticated scan is required a non-human service account will be used to
  complete the task.

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.

  UDS defines the vulnerability scanning activities in which the system
  implements privileged access authorization by assigning the appropriate
  functions or actions in the role assigned. This ensures on the required
  actions are executed by a non-human entity and are programmatically defined
  while also auditable through logs.
