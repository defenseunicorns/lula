control-acronym: "[r5] RA-05(02)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Update the system vulnerabilities to be scanned [Selection (one or more):
  [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; prior to a new scan; when new
  vulnerabilities are identified and reported].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Due to the complexity of modern software, systems, and other factors, new
  vulnerabilities are discovered on a regular basis. It is important that newly
  discovered vulnerabilities are added to the list of vulnerabilities to be
  scanned to ensure that the organization can take steps to mitigate those
  vulnerabilities in a timely manner. Related Control(s): SI-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Procedures addressing vulnerability scanning;
  assessment report; vulnerability scanning tools and associated configuration
  documentation; vulnerability scanning results; patch and vulnerability
  management records; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with vulnerability scanning
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with vulnerability scan analysis
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for vulnerability scanning;
  mechanisms/tools supporting and/or implementing vulnerability scanning].
