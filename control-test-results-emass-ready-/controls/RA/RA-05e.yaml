control-acronym: "[r5] RA-05"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Monitor and scan for vulnerabilities in the system and hosted applications
  [Assignment: organization-defined frequency and/or randomly in accordance with
  organization-defined process] and when new vulnerabilities potentially
  affecting the system are identified and reported;

  b. Employ vulnerability monitoring tools and techniques that facilitate
  interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability
  management process by using standards for:

  1. Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;

  2. Formatting checklists and test procedures; and

  3. Measuring vulnerability impact;

  c. Analyze vulnerability scan reports and results from vulnerability
  monitoring;

  d. Remediate legitimate vulnerabilities [Assignment: organization-defined
  response times] in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk;

  e. Share information obtained from the vulnerability monitoring process and
  control assessments with [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]
  to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other systems; and

  f. Employ vulnerability monitoring tools that include the capability to
  readily update the vulnerabilities to be scanned.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Security categorization of information and systems guides the frequency and
  comprehensiveness of vulnerability monitoring (including scans). Organizations
  determine the required vulnerability monitoring for system components,
  ensuring that the potential sources of vulnerabilities—such as infrastructure
  components (e.g., switches, routers, guards, sensors), networked printers,
  scanners, and copiers—are not overlooked. The capability to readily update
  vulnerability monitoring tools as new vulnerabilities are discovered and
  announced and as new scanning methods are developed helps to ensure that new
  vulnerabilities are not missed by employed vulnerability monitoring tools. The
  vulnerability monitoring tool update process helps to ensure that potential
  vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly as
  possible. Vulnerability monitoring and analyses for custom software may
  require additional approaches, such as static analysis, dynamic analysis,
  binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can use
  these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of tools,
  including web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, and binary
  analyzers.


  Vulnerability monitoring includes scanning for patch levels; scanning for
  functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to
  users or devices; and scanning for flow control mechanisms that are improperly
  configured or operating incorrectly. Vulnerability monitoring may also include
  continuous vulnerability monitoring tools that use instrumentation to
  continuously analyze components. Instrumentation-based tools may improve
  accuracy and may be run throughout an organization without scanning.
  Vulnerability monitoring tools that facilitate interoperability include tools
  that are Security Content Automated Protocol (SCAP)-validated. Thus,
  organizations consider using scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in
  the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that
  employ the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the
  presence of vulnerabilities. Sources for vulnerability information include the
  Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability
  Database (NVD). Control assessments, such as red team exercises, provide
  additional sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan.
  Organizations also consider using scanning tools that express vulnerability
  impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).


  Vulnerability monitoring includes a channel and process for receiving reports
  of security vulnerabilities from the public at-large. Vulnerability disclosure
  programs can be as simple as publishing a monitored email address or web form
  that can receive reports, including notification authorizing good-faith
  research and disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Organizations generally
  expect that such research is happening with or without their authorization and
  can use public vulnerability disclosure channels to increase the likelihood
  that discovered vulnerabilities are reported directly to the organization for
  remediation.


  Organizations may also employ the use of financial incentives (also known as
  bug bounties) to further encourage external security researchers to report
  discovered vulnerabilities. Bug bounty programs can be tailored to the
  organization’s needs. Bounties can be operated indefinitely or over a defined
  period of time and can be offered to the general public or to a curated group.
  Organizations may run public and private bounties simultaneously and could
  choose to offer partially credentialed access to certain participants in order
  to evaluate security vulnerabilities from privileged vantage points. Related

  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
