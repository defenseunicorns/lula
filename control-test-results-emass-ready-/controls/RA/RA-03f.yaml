control-acronym: "[r5] RA-03"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Conduct a risk assessment, including:

  1. Identifying threats to and vulnerabilities in the system;

  2. Determining the likelihood and magnitude of harm from unauthorized access,
  use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of the system, the
  information it processes, stores, or transmits, and any related information;
  and

  3. Determining the likelihood and impact of adverse effects on individuals
  arising from the processing of personally identifiable information;

  b. Integrate risk assessment results and risk management decisions from the
  organization and mission or business process perspectives with system-level
  risk assessments;

  c. Document risk assessment results in [Selection: security and privacy plans;
  risk assessment report; [Assignment: organization-defined document]];

  d. Review risk assessment results [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency];

  e. Disseminate risk assessment results to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles]; and

  f. Update the risk assessment [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] or
  when there are significant changes to the system, its environment of
  operation, or other conditions that may impact the security or privacy state
  of the system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Risk assessments consider threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact to
  organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and
  the Nation. Risk assessments also consider risk from external parties,
  including contractors who operate systems on behalf of the organization,
  individuals who access organizational systems, service providers, and
  outsourcing entities.


  Organizations can conduct risk assessments at all three levels in the risk
  management hierarchy (i.e., organization level, mission/business process
  level, or information system level) and at any stage in the system development
  life cycle. Risk assessments can also be conducted at various steps in the
  Risk Management Framework, including preparation, categorization, control
  selection, control implementation, control assessment, authorization, and
  control monitoring. Risk assessment is an ongoing activity carried out
  throughout the system development life cycle.


  Risk assessments can also address information related to the system, including
  system design, the intended use of the system, testing results, and supply
  chain-related information or artifacts. Risk assessments can play an important
  role in control selection processes, particularly during the application of
  tailoring guidance and in the earliest phases of capability determination.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Risk assessment policy; risk assessment procedures;
  security and privacy planning policy and procedures; procedures addressing
  organizational assessments of risk; risk assessment; risk assessment results;
  risk assessment reviews; risk assessment updates; system security plan;
  privacy plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with risk assessment
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with security and privacy
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for risk assessment; mechanisms
  supporting and/or conducting, documenting, reviewing, disseminating, and
  updating the risk assessment].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: RA-3.8, RA-3.9.
  The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following
  Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS provides data (like vulnerability
  scan results, logs) that feed into a risk assessment, but the actual
  assessment is done outside of the UDS boundary.)
