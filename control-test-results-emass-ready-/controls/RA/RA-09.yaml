  Description:

  Identify critical system components and functions by performing a criticality
  analysis for [Assignment: organization-defined systems, system components, or
  system services] at [Assignment: organization-defined decision points in the
  system development life cycle].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Not all system components, functions, or services necessarily require
  significant protections. For example, criticality analysis is a key tenet of
  supply chain risk management and informs the prioritization of protection
  activities. The identification of critical system components and functions
  considers applicable laws, executive orders, regulations, directives,
  policies, standards, system functionality requirements, system and component
  interfaces, and system and component dependencies. Systems engineers conduct a
  functional decomposition of a system to identify mission-critical functions
  and components. The functional decomposition includes the identification of
  organizational missions supported by the system, decomposition into the
  specific functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the
  hardware, software, and firmware components that implement those functions,
  including when the functions are shared by many components within
  and  external to the system.


  The operational environment of a system or a system component may impact the
  criticality, including the connections to and dependencies on cyber-physical
  systems, devices, system-of-systems, and outsourced IT services. System
  components that allow unmediated access to critical system components or
  functions are considered critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities that
  such components create. Component and function criticality are assessed in
  terms of the impact of a component or function failure on the organizational
  missions that are supported by the system that contains the components and
  functions.


  Criticality analysis is performed when an architecture or design is being
  developed, modified, or upgraded. If such analysis is performed early in the
  system development life cycle, organizations may be able to modify the system
  design to reduce the critical nature of these components and functions, such
  as by adding redundancy or alternate paths into the system design. Criticality
  analysis can also influence the protection measures required by development
  contractors. In addition to criticality analysis for systems, system
  components, and system services, criticality analysis of information is an
  important consideration. Such analysis is conducted as part of security
  categorization in RA-2. Related Control(s): CP-2, PL-2, PL-8, PL-11, PM-1,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Risk assessment policy; assessment reports; criticality
  analysis/finalized criticality for each component/subcomponent; audit
  records/event logs; analysis reports; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with assessment and auditing
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with criticality analysis
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for assessments and audits;
  mechanisms/tools supporting and/or implementing assessments and auditing].
