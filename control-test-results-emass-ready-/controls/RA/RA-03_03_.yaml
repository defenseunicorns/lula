  Description:

  Determine the current cyber threat environment on an ongoing basis using
  [Assignment: organization-defined means].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The threat awareness information that is gathered feeds into the
  organizationâ€™s information security operations to ensure that procedures are
  updated in response to the changing threat environment. For example, at higher
  threat levels, organizations may change the privilege or authentication
  thresholds required to perform certain operations. Related Control(s):  AT-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
