control-acronym: "[r5] RA-03(02)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Use all-source intelligence to assist in the analysis of risk.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations employ all-source intelligence to inform engineering,
  acquisition, and risk management decisions. All-source intelligence consists
  of information derived from all available sources, including publicly
  available or open-source information, measurement and signature intelligence,
  human intelligence, signals intelligence, and imagery intelligence. All-source
  intelligence is used to analyze the risk of vulnerabilities (both intentional
  and unintentional) from development, manufacturing, and delivery processes,
  people, and the environment. The risk analysis may be performed on suppliers
  at multiple tiers in the supply chain sufficient to manage risks.
  Organizations may develop agreements to share all-source intelligence
  information or resulting decisions with other organizations, as appropriate.
  Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Risk assessment policy; security planning policy and
  procedures; procedures addressing organizational assessments of risk; risk
  assessment; risk assessment results; risk assessment reviews; risk assessment
  updates; risk intelligence reports; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with risk assessment
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for risk assessment; mechanisms
  supporting and/or conducting, documenting, reviewing, disseminating, and
  updating the risk assessment].
