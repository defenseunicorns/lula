control-acronym: "[r5] RA-05(04)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Determine information about the system that is discoverable and take
  [Assignment: organization-defined corrective actions].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Discoverable information includes information that adversaries could obtain
  without compromising or breaching the system, such as by collecting
  information that the system is exposing or by conducting extensive web
  searches. Corrective actions include notifying appropriate organizational
  personnel, removing designated information, or changing the system to make the
  designated information less relevant or attractive to adversaries. This
  enhancement excludes intentionally discoverable information that may be part
  of a decoy capability (e.g., honeypots, honeynets, or deception nets) deployed
  by the organization. Related Control(s): AU-13, SC-26.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Procedures addressing vulnerability scanning;
  assessment report; penetration test results; vulnerability scanning results;
  risk assessment report; records of corrective actions taken; incident response
  records; audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with vulnerability scanning
  and/or penetration testing responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  vulnerability scan analysis responsibilities; organizational personnel
  responsible for risk response; organizational personnel responsible for
  incident management and response; organizational personnel with security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for vulnerability scanning;
  organizational processes for risk response; organizational processes for
  incident management and response; mechanisms/tools supporting and/or
  implementing vulnerability scanning; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  risk response; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing incident management
  and response].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: RA-5(4).1,
  RA-5(4).2, RA-5(4).3. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant
  because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test
  result/compliance statement: RA-5(4).1, RA-5(4).2, RA-5(4).3.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (This is an organizational level
  control that is related to information about the information system and its
  discoverability outside of the organization.)
