control-acronym: "[r5] RA-05(11)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Establish a public reporting channel for receiving reports of vulnerabilities
  in organizational systems and system components.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The reporting channel is publicly discoverable and contains clear language
  authorizing good-faith research and the disclosure of vulnerabilities to the
  organization. The organization does not condition its authorization on an
  expectation of indefinite non-disclosure to the public by the reporting entity
  but may request a specific time period to properly remediate the
  vulnerability. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
