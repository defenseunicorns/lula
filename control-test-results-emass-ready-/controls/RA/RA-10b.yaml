control-acronym: "[r5] RA-10"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Establish and maintain a cyber threat hunting capability to:

  1. Search for indicators of compromise in organizational systems; and

  2. Detect, track, and disrupt threats that evade existing controls; and

  b. Employ the threat hunting capability [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Threat hunting is an active means of cyber defense in contrast to traditional
  protection measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention
  systems, quarantining malicious code in sandboxes, and Security Information
  and Event Management technologies and systems. Cyber threat hunting involves
  proactively searching organizational systems, networks, and infrastructure for
  advanced threats. The objective is to track and disrupt cyber adversaries as
  early as possible in the attack sequence and to measurably improve the speed
  and accuracy of organizational responses. Indications of compromise include
  unusual network traffic, unusual file changes, and the presence of malicious
  code. Threat hunting teams leverage existing threat intelligence and may
  create new threat intelligence, which is shared with peer organizations,
  Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAO), Information Sharing and
  Analysis Centers (ISAC), and relevant government departments and agencies.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Risk assessment policy; assessment reports; audit
  records/event logs; threat hunting capability; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with threat hunting
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for assessments and audits;
  mechanisms/tools supporting and/or implementing threat hunting capabilities].
