control-acronym: "[r5] PE-06(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Monitor physical access to the facility where the system resides using
  physical intrusion alarms and surveillance equipment.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Physical intrusion alarms can be employed to alert security personnel when
  unauthorized access to the facility is attempted. Alarm systems work in
  conjunction with physical barriers, physical access control systems, and
  security guards by triggering a response when these other forms of security
  have been compromised or breached. Physical intrusion alarms can include
  different types of sensor devices, such as motion sensors, contact sensors,
  and broken glass sensors. Surveillance equipment includes video cameras
  installed at strategic locations throughout the facility. Related Control(s):
  None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing physical access monitoring; physical access logs or
  records; physical access monitoring records; physical access log reviews;
  system security plan; privacy plan; privacy impact assessment; privacy risk
  assessment documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with physical access
  monitoring responsibilities; organizational personnel with incident response
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for monitoring physical intrusion
  alarms and surveillance equipment; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  physical access monitoring; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing physical
  intrusion alarms and surveillance equipment].
