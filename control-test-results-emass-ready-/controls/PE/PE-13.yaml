control-acronym: "[r5] PE-13"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Employ and maintain fire detection and suppression systems that are supported
  by an independent energy source.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The provision of fire detection and suppression systems applies primarily to
  organizational facilities that contain concentrations of system resources,
  including data centers, server rooms, and mainframe computer rooms. Fire
  detection and suppression systems that may require an independent energy
  source include sprinkler systems and smoke detectors. An independent energy
  source is an energy source, such as a microgrid, that is separate, or can be
  separated, from the energy sources providing power for the other parts of the
  facility. Related Control(s): AT-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing fire protection; fire suppression and detection
  devices/systems; fire suppression and detection devices/systems documentation;
  test records of fire suppression and detection devices/systems; system
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  fire detection and suppression devices/systems; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing fire
  suppression/detection devices/systems].

  source.

  - employed fire detection systems are maintained.

  - fire suppression systems are employed.

  - employed fire suppression systems are supported by an independent energy
  source.

  - employed fire suppression systems are maintained.
