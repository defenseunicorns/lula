control-acronym: "[r5] PE-13(02)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Employ fire suppression systems that activate automatically and notify
  [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] and [Assignment:
  organization-defined emergency responders]; and

  (b) Employ an automatic fire suppression capability when the facility is not
  staffed on a continuous basis.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations can identify specific personnel, roles, and emergency responders
  if individuals on the notification list need to have appropriate access
  authorizations and/or clearances (e.g., to enter to facilities where access is
  restricted due to the impact level or classification of information within the
  facility). Notification mechanisms may require independent energy sources to
  ensure that the notification capability is not adversely affected by the fire.
  Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing fire protection; fire suppression and detection
  devices/systems documentation; facility housing the system; alarm
  service-level agreements; test records of fire suppression and detection
  devices/systems; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  fire detection and suppression devices/systems; organizational personnel with
  responsibilities for providing automatic notifications of any activation of
  fire suppression devices/systems to appropriate personnel, roles, and
  emergency responders; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing fire
  suppression devices/systems; activation of fire suppression devices/systems
  (simulated); automated notifications].

  Determine if:

  - fire suppression systems that activate automatically are employed.

  - fire suppression systems that notify [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles] automatically are employed.

  - fire suppression systems that notify [Assignment: organization-defined
  emergency responders] automatically are employed.
