control-acronym: "[r5] PE-10"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Provide the capability of shutting off power to [Assignment:
  organization-defined system or individual system components] in emergency
  situations;

  b. Place emergency shutoff switches or devices in [Assignment:
  organization-defined location by system or system component] to facilitate
  access for authorized personnel; and

  c. Protect emergency power shutoff capability from unauthorized activation.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Emergency power shutoff primarily applies to organizational facilities that
  contain concentrations of system resources, including data centers, mainframe
  computer rooms, server rooms, and areas with computer-controlled machinery.
  Related Control(s): PE-15.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing power source emergency shutoff; emergency shutoff
  controls or switches; locations housing emergency shutoff switches and
  devices; security safeguards protecting the emergency power shutoff capability
  from unauthorized activation; system security plan; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with the responsibility for
  the emergency power shutoff capability (both implementing and using the
  capability); organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing emergency power
  shutoff].
