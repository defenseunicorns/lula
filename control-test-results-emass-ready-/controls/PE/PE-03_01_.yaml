control-information: >-
  Description:

  Enforce physical access authorizations to the system in addition to the
  physical access controls for the facility at [Assignment: organization-defined
  physical spaces containing one or more components of the system].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Control of physical access to the system provides additional physical security
  for those areas within facilities where there is a concentration of system
  components. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing physical access control; physical access control logs or
  records; physical access control devices; access authorizations; access
  credentials; system entry and exit points; list of areas within the facility
  containing concentrations of system components or system components requiring
  additional physical protection; system security plan; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with physical access
  authorization responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for physical access control to
  the information system/components; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  physical access control for facility areas containing system components].

  Determine if:

  - physical access authorizations to the system are enforced.

  - physical access controls are enforced for the facility at [Assignment:
  organization-defined physical spaces containing one or more components of the
