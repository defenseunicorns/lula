control-acronym: "[r5] PE-09"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Protect power equipment and power cabling for the system from damage and
  destruction.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations determine the types of protection necessary for the power
  equipment and cabling employed at different locations that are both internal
  and external to organizational facilities and environments of operation. Types
  of power equipment and cabling include internal cabling and uninterruptable
  power sources in offices or data centers, generators and power cabling outside
  of buildings, and power sources for self-contained components such as
  satellites, vehicles, and other deployable systems. Related Control(s): PE-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing power equipment/cabling protection; facilities housing
  power equipment/cabling; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with the responsibility to
  protect power equipment/cabling; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the protection
  of power equipment/cabling].
