control-information: >-
  Description:

  Limit personally identifiable information contained in visitor access records
  to the following elements identified in the privacy risk assessment:
  [Assignment: organization-defined elements].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations may have requirements that specify the contents of visitor
  access records. Limiting personally identifiable information in visitor access
  records when such information is not needed for operational purposes helps
  reduce the level of privacy risk created by a system. Related Control(s):
  RA-3, SA-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  personally identifiable information processing policy; privacy risk assessment
  documentation; privacy impact assessment; visitor access records; personally
  identifiable information inventory; system security plan; privacy plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with visitor access records
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for maintaining and reviewing
  visitor access records].
