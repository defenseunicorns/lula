control-acronym: "[r5] PE-12"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Employ and maintain automatic emergency lighting for the system that activates
  in the event of a power outage or disruption and that covers emergency exits
  and evacuation routes within the facility.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The provision of emergency lighting applies primarily to organizational
  facilities that contain concentrations of system resources, including data
  centers, server rooms, and mainframe computer rooms. Emergency lighting
  provisions for the system are described in the contingency plan for the
  organization. If emergency lighting for the system fails or cannot be
  provided, organizations consider alternate processing sites for power-related
  contingencies. Related Control(s): CP-2, CP-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing emergency lighting; emergency lighting documentation;
  emergency lighting test records; emergency exits and evacuation routes; system
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with the responsibility for
  emergency lighting and/or planning; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing an emergency
  lighting capability].
