control-acronym: "[r5] PE-14"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Maintain [Selection (one or more): temperature; humidity; pressure;
  radiation; [Assignment: organization-defined environmental control]] levels
  within the facility where the system resides at [Assignment:
  organization-defined acceptable levels]; and

  b. Monitor environmental control levels [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The provision of environmental controls applies primarily to organizational
  facilities that contain concentrations of system resources (e.g., data
  centers, mainframe computer rooms, and server rooms). Insufficient
  environmental controls, especially in very harsh environments, can have a
  significant adverse impact on the availability of systems and system
  components that are needed to support organizational mission and business
  functions. Related Control(s): AT-3, CP-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing temperature and humidity control; temperature and
  humidity controls; facility housing the system; temperature and humidity
  controls documentation; temperature and humidity records; system security
  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  system environmental controls; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the maintenance
  and monitoring of temperature and humidity levels].
