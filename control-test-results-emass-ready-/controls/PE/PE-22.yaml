control-acronym: "[r5] PE-22"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Mark [Assignment: organization-defined system hardware components] indicating
  the impact level or classification level of the information permitted to be
  processed, stored, or transmitted by the hardware component.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Hardware components that may require marking include input and output devices.
  Input devices include desktop and notebook computers, keyboards, tablets, and
  smart phones. Output devices include printers, monitors/video displays,
  facsimile machines, scanners, copiers, and audio devices. Permissions
  controlling output to the output devices are addressed in AC-3 or AC-4.
  Components are marked to indicate the impact level or classification level of
  the system to which the devices are connected, or the impact level or
  classification level of the information permitted to be output. Security
  marking refers to the use of human-readable security attributes. Security
  labeling refers to the use of security attributes for internal system data
  structures. Security marking is generally not required for hardware components
  that process, store, or transmit information determined by organizations to be
  in the public domain or to be publicly releasable. However, organizations may
  require markings for hardware components that process, store, or transmit
  public information in order to indicate that such information is publicly
  releasable. Marking of system hardware components reflects applicable laws,
  executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards. Related
  Control(s): AC-3, AC-4, AC-16, MP-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing component marking; list of component marking security
  attributes; component inventory; information types and their
  impact/classification level; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with component marking
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with component inventory
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  categorization/classification responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for component marking; automated
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing component marking].
