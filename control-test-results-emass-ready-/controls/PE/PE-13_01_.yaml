control-acronym: "[r5] PE-13(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Employ fire detection systems that activate automatically and notify
  [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] and [Assignment:
  organization-defined emergency responders] in the event of a fire.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations can identify personnel, roles, and emergency responders if
  individuals on the notification list need to have access authorizations or
  clearances (e.g., to enter to facilities where access is restricted due to the
  classification or impact level of information within the facility).
  Notification mechanisms may require independent energy sources to ensure that
  the notification capability is not adversely affected by the fire. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing fire protection; facility housing the information
  system; alarm service-level agreements; test records of fire suppression and
  detection devices/systems; fire suppression and detection devices/systems
  documentation; alerts/notifications of fire events; system security plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  fire detection and suppression devices/systems; organizational personnel with
  responsibilities for notifying appropriate personnel, roles, and emergency
  responders of fires; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing fire detection
  devices/systems; activation of fire detection devices/systems (simulated);
  automated notifications].

  Determine if:

  - fire detection systems that activate automatically are employed in the event
  of a fire.

  - fire detection systems that notify [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles] automatically are employed in the event of a fire.

  - fire detection systems that notify [Assignment: organization-defined
  emergency responders] automatically are employed in the event of a fire.
