  Description:

  a. Plan the location or site of the facility where the system resides
  considering physical and environmental hazards; and

  b. For existing facilities, consider the physical and environmental hazards in
  the organizational risk management strategy.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Physical and environmental hazards include floods, fires, tornadoes,
  earthquakes, hurricanes, terrorism, vandalism, an electromagnetic pulse,
  electrical interference, and other forms of incoming electromagnetic
  radiation. The location of system components within the facility is addressed
  in PE-18. Related Control(s): CP-2, PE-18, PE-19, PM-8, PM-9, RA-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy; physical
  site planning documents; organizational assessment of risk; contingency plan;
  risk mitigation strategy documentation; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with site selection
  responsibilities for the facility housing the system; organizational personnel
  with risk mitigation responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for site planning].
