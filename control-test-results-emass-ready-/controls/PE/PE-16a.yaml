control-acronym: "[r5] PE-16"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Authorize and control [Assignment: organization-defined types of system
  components] entering and exiting the facility; and

  b. Maintain records of the system components.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Enforcing authorizations for entry and exit of system components may require
  restricting access to delivery areas and isolating the areas from the system
  and media libraries. Related Control(s): CM-3, CM-8, MA-2, MA-3, MP-5, PE-20,
  SR-2, SR-3, SR-4, SR-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing the delivery and removal of system components from the
  facility; facility housing the system; records of items entering and exiting
  the facility; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  controlling system components entering and exiting the facility;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational process for authorizing, monitoring, and
  controlling system-related items entering and exiting the facility; mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing, authorizing, monitoring, and controlling
  system-related items entering and exiting the facility].

  Determine if:

  - [Assignment: organization-defined types of system components] are authorized
  when entering the facility.

  - [Assignment: organization-defined types of system components] are controlled
  when entering the facility.

  - [Assignment: organization-defined types of system components] are authorized
  when exiting the facility.

  - [Assignment: organization-defined types of system components] are controlled
  when exiting the facility.
