control-acronym: "[r5] PE-17"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Determine and document the [Assignment: organization-defined alternate work
  sites] allowed for use by employees;

  b. Employ the following controls at alternate work sites: [Assignment:
  organization-defined controls];

  c. Assess the effectiveness of controls at alternate work sites; and

  d. Provide a means for employees to communicate with information security and
  privacy personnel in case of incidents.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Alternate work sites include government facilities or the private residences
  of employees. While distinct from alternative processing sites, alternate work
  sites can provide readily available alternate locations during contingency
  operations. Organizations can define different sets of controls for specific
  alternate work sites or types of sites depending on the work-related
  activities conducted at the sites. Implementing and assessing the
  effectiveness of organization-defined controls and providing a means to
  communicate incidents at alternate work sites supports the contingency
  planning activities of organizations. Related Control(s): AC-17, AC-18, CP-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing alternate work sites for organizational personnel; list
  of security controls required for alternate work sites; assessments of
  security controls at alternate work sites; system security plan; privacy plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel approving the use of
  alternate work sites; organizational personnel using alternate work sites;
  organizational personnel assessing controls at alternate work sites;
  organizational personnel with information security and privacy
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for security and privacy at
  alternate work sites; mechanisms supporting alternate work sites; security and
  privacy controls employed at alternate work sites; means of communication
  between personnel at alternate work sites and security and privacy personnel].
