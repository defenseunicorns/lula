control-acronym: "[r5] PE-06"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Monitor physical access to the facility where the system resides to detect
  and respond to physical security incidents;

  b. Review physical access logs [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]
  and upon occurrence of [Assignment: organization-defined events or potential
  indications of events]; and

  c. Coordinate results of reviews and investigations with the organizational
  incident response capability.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Physical access monitoring includes publicly accessible areas within
  organizational facilities. Examples of physical access monitoring include the
  employment of guards, video surveillance equipment (i.e., cameras), and sensor
  devices. Reviewing physical access logs can help identify suspicious activity,
  anomalous events, or potential threats. The reviews can be supported by audit
  logging controls, such as AU-2, if the access logs are part of an automated
  system. Organizational incident response capabilities include investigations
  of physical security incidents and responses to the incidents. Incidents
  include security violations or suspicious physical access activities.
  Suspicious physical access activities include accesses outside of normal work
  hours, repeated accesses to areas not normally accessed, accesses for unusual
  lengths of time, and out-of-sequence accesses. Related Control(s): AU-2, AU-6,
  AU-9, AU-12, CA-7, CP-10, IR-4, IR-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing physical access monitoring; physical access logs or
  records; physical access monitoring records; physical access log reviews;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with physical access
  monitoring responsibilities; organizational personnel with incident response
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for monitoring physical access;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing physical access monitoring;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the review of physical access logs].
