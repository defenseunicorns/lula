control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Enforce physical access authorizations at [Assignment: organization-defined
  entry and exit points to the facility where the system resides] by:

  1. Verifying individual access authorizations before granting access to the
  facility; and

  2. Controlling ingress and egress to the facility using [Selection (one or
  more): [Assignment: organization-defined physical access control systems or
  devices]; guards];

  b. Maintain physical access audit logs for [Assignment: organization-defined
  entry or exit points];

  c. Control access to areas within the facility designated as publicly
  accessible by implementing the following controls: [Assignment:
  organization-defined physical access controls];

  d. Escort visitors and control visitor activity [Assignment:
  organization-defined circumstances requiring visitor escorts and control of
  visitor activity];

  e. Secure keys, combinations, and other physical access devices;

  f. Inventory [Assignment: organization-defined physical access devices] every
  [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and

  g. Change combinations and keys [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]
  and/or when keys are lost, combinations are compromised, or when individuals
  possessing the keys or combinations are transferred or terminated.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Physical access control applies to employees and visitors. Individuals with
  permanent physical access authorizations are not considered visitors. Physical
  access controls for publicly accessible areas may include physical access
  control logs/records, guards, or physical access devices and barriers to
  prevent movement from publicly accessible areas to non-public areas.
  Organizations determine the types of guards needed, including professional
  security staff, system users, or administrative staff. Physical access devices
  include keys, locks, combinations, biometric readers, and card readers.
  Physical access control systems comply with applicable laws, executive orders,
  directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Organizations
  have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be
  procedural, automated, or some combination thereof. Physical access points can
  include facility access points, interior access points to systems that require
  supplemental access controls, or both. Components of systems may be in areas
  designated as publicly accessible with organizations controlling access to the
  components. Related Control(s): AT-3, AU-2, AU-6, AU-9, AU-13, CP-10, IA-3,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing physical access control; physical access control logs or
  records; inventory records of physical access control devices; system entry
  and exit points; records of key and lock combination changes; storage
  locations for physical access control devices; physical access control
  devices; list of security safeguards controlling access to designated publicly
  accessible areas within facility; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with physical access control
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for physical access control;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing physical access control; physical
  access control devices].
