  Supplemental Guidance:

  Visitor access records include the names and organizations of individuals
  visiting, visitor signatures, forms of identification, dates of access, entry
  and departure times, purpose of visits, and the names and organizations of
  individuals visited. Access record reviews determine if access authorizations

  business functions. Access records are not required for publicly accessible
  areas. Related Control(s): PE-2, PE-3, PE-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing visitor access records; visitor access control logs or
  records; visitor access record or log reviews; system security plan; privacy
  plan; privacy impact assessment; privacy risk assessment documentation; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with visitor access record
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for maintaining and reviewing
  visitor access records; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the
