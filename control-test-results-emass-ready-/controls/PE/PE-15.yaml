control-acronym: "[r5] PE-15"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Protect the system from damage resulting from water leakage by providing
  master shutoff or isolation valves that are accessible, working properly, and
  known to key personnel.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The provision of water damage protection primarily applies to organizational
  facilities that contain concentrations of system resources, including data
  centers, server rooms, and mainframe computer rooms. Isolation valves can be
  employed in addition to or in lieu of master shutoff valves to shut off water
  supplies in specific areas of concern without affecting entire organizations.
  Related Control(s): AT-3, PE-10.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing water damage protection; facility housing the system;
  master shutoff valves; list of key personnel with knowledge of location and
  activation procedures for master shutoff valves for the plumbing system;
  master shutoff valve documentation; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  system environmental controls; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Master water-shutoff valves; organizational process for
  activating master water shutoff].

  Determine if:

  - the system is protected from damage resulting from water leakage by
  providing master shutoff or isolation valves.

  - the master shutoff or isolation valves are accessible.

  - the master shutoff or isolation valves are working properly.

  - the master shutoff or isolation valves are known to key personnel.
