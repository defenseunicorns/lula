control-acronym: "[r5] PE-04"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Control physical access to [Assignment: organization-defined system
  distribution and transmission lines] within organizational facilities using
  [Assignment: organization-defined security controls].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Security controls applied to system distribution and transmission lines
  prevent accidental damage, disruption, and physical tampering. Such controls
  may also be necessary to prevent eavesdropping or modification of unencrypted
  transmissions. Security controls used to control physical access to system
  distribution and transmission lines include disconnected or locked spare
  jacks, locked wiring closets, protection of cabling by conduit or cable trays,
  and wiretapping sensors. Related Control(s): AT-3, IA-4, MP-2, MP-4, PE-2,
  PE-3, PE-5, PE-9, SC-7, SC-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing access control for transmission mediums; system design
  documentation; facility communications and wiring diagrams; list of physical
  security safeguards applied to system distribution and transmission lines;
  system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with physical access control
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for access control to
  distribution and transmission lines; mechanisms/security safeguards supporting
  and/or implementing access control to distribution and transmission lines].
