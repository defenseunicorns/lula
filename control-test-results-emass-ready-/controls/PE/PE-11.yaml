control-acronym: "[r5] PE-11"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Provide an uninterruptible power supply to facilitate [Selection (one or
  more): an orderly shutdown of the system; transition of the system to
  long-term alternate power] in the event of a primary power source loss.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is an electrical system or mechanism
  that provides emergency power when there is a failure of the main power
  source. A UPS is typically used to protect computers, data centers,
  telecommunication equipment, or other electrical equipment where an unexpected
  power disruption could cause injuries, fatalities, serious mission or business
  disruption, or loss of data or information. A UPS differs from an emergency
  power system or backup generator in that the UPS provides near-instantaneous
  protection from unanticipated power interruptions from the main power source
  by providing energy stored in batteries, supercapacitors, or flywheels. The
  battery duration of a UPS is relatively short but provides sufficient time to
  start a standby power source, such as a backup generator, or properly shut
  down the system. Related Control(s): AT-3, CP-2, CP-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing emergency power; uninterruptible power supply;
  uninterruptible power supply documentation; uninterruptible power supply test
  records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with the responsibility for
  emergency power and/or planning; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting and/or implementing an
  uninterruptible power supply; the uninterruptable power supply].
