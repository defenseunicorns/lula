control-acronym: "[r5] PE-02"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop, approve, and maintain a list of individuals with authorized access
  to the facility where the system resides;

  b. Issue authorization credentials for facility access;

  c. Review the access list detailing authorized facility access by individuals
  [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and

  d. Remove individuals from the facility access list when access is no longer
  required.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Physical access authorizations apply to employees and visitors. Individuals
  with permanent physical access authorization credentials are not considered
  visitors. Authorization credentials include ID badges, identification cards,
  and smart cards. Organizations determine the strength of authorization
  credentials needed consistent with applicable laws, executive orders,
  directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Physical access
  authorizations may not be necessary to access certain areas within facilities
  that are designated as publicly accessible. Related Control(s): AT-3, AU-9,
  IA-4, MA-5, MP-2, PE-3, PE-4, PE-5, PE-8, PM-12, PS-3, PS-4, PS-5, PS-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing physical access authorizations; authorized personnel
  access list; authorization credentials; physical access list reviews; physical
  access termination records and associated documentation; system security plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with physical access
  authorization responsibilities; organizational personnel with physical access
  to system facility; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for physical access
  authorizations; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing physical access
  authorizations].
