control-acronym: "[r5] PE-05"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Control physical access to output from [Assignment: organization-defined
  output devices] to prevent unauthorized individuals from obtaining the output.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Controlling physical access to output devices includes placing output devices
  in locked rooms or other secured areas with keypad or card reader access
  controls and allowing access to authorized individuals only, placing output
  devices in locations that can be monitored by personnel, installing monitor or
  screen filters, and using headphones. Examples of output devices include
  monitors, printers, scanners, audio devices, facsimile machines, and copiers.
  Related Control(s): PE-2, PE-3, PE-4, PE-18.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing access control for display medium; facility layout of
  system components; actual displays from system components; list of output
  devices and associated outputs requiring physical access controls; physical
  access control logs or records for areas containing output devices and related
  outputs; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with physical access control
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for access control to output
  devices; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing access control to output
  devices].
