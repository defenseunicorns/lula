  Description:

  a. Develop, document, and disseminate to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles]:

  1. [Selection (one or more): Organization-level; Mission/business
  process-level; System-level] physical and environmental protection policy
  that:
    (a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
    (b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and
  2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the physical and
  environmental protection policy and the associated physical and environmental
  protection controls;

  b. Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the
  development, documentation, and dissemination of the physical and
  environmental protection policy and procedures; and

  c. Review and update the current physical and environmental protection:

  1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events]; and

  2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Physical and environmental protection policy and procedures address the
  controls in the PE family that are implemented within systems and
  organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in
  establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute
  to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security
  and privacy programs collaborate on the development of physical and
  environmental protection policy and procedures. Security and privacy program
  policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general,
  and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and
  procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and
  privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex
  nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and
  privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if
  needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and
  can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
  Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or
  more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to physical and
  environmental protection policy and procedures include assessment or audit
  findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws,
  executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and
  guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational
  policy or procedure. Related Control(s): AT-3, PM-9, PS-8, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy and
  procedures; system security plan; privacy plan; organizational risk management
  strategy; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with physical and
  environmental protection responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security and privacy responsibilities].
