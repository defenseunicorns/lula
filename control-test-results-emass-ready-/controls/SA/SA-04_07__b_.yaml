control-acronym: "[r5] SA-04(07)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Limit the use of commercially provided information assurance and
  information assurance-enabled information technology products to those
  products that have been successfully evaluated against a National Information
  Assurance partnership (NIAP)-approved Protection Profile for a specific
  technology type, if such a profile exists; and

  (b) Require, if no NIAP-approved Protection Profile exists for a specific
  technology type but a commercially provided information technology product
  relies on cryptographic functionality to enforce its security policy, that the
  cryptographic module is FIPS-validated or NSA-approved.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  See NIAP CCEVS for additional information on NIAP. See NIST CMVP for
  additional information on FIPS-validated cryptographic modules. Related
  Control(s): IA-7, SC-12, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Supply chain risk management plan; system and services
  acquisition policy; procedures addressing the integration of security
  requirements, descriptions, and criteria into the acquisition process;
  solicitation documents; acquisition documentation; acquisition contracts for
  the system, system component, or system service; list of deployed IT
  products/solutions; NAIP-approved protection profiles; FIPS-validation
  information for cryptographic functionality; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with acquisition/contracting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with the responsibility for
  determining system security requirements; organizational personnel responsible
  for ensuring that information assurance products have been evaluated against a
  NIAP-approved protection profile or for ensuring products relying on
  cryptographic functionality are FIPS-validated; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for selecting and employing
  products/services evaluated against a NIAP-approved protection profile or
  FIPS-validated products].

test-results: UDS uses FIPS-validated images where a cryptographic module is
  required. All FIPS-validated software is sourced from Iron Bank or from
  Defense Unicorns. Entropy must be provided as specified in its cryptographic
  policy. For example UDS uses Istio and Keycloak enabled FIPS image (140-2
  encryption) in transit for apps hosted.
