  Description:

  a. Acquire, develop, and manage the system using [Assignment:
  organization-defined system development life cycle] that incorporates
  information security and privacy considerations;

  b. Define and document information security and privacy roles and
  responsibilities throughout the system development life cycle;

  c. Identify individuals having information security and privacy roles and
  responsibilities; and

  d. Integrate the organizational information security and privacy risk
  management process into system development life cycle activities.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A system development life cycle process provides the foundation for the
  successful development, implementation, and operation of organizational
  systems. The integration of security and privacy considerations early in the
  system development life cycle is a foundational principle of systems security
  engineering and privacy engineering. To apply the required controls within the
  system development life cycle requires a basic understanding of information
  security and privacy, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to
  critical mission and business functions. The security engineering principles
  in SA-8 help individuals properly design, code, and test systems and system
  components. Organizations include qualified personnel (e.g., senior agency
  information security officers, senior agency officials for privacy, security
  and privacy architects, and security and privacy engineers) in system
  development life cycle processes to ensure that established security and
  privacy requirements are incorporated into organizational systems. Role-based
  security and privacy training programs can ensure that individuals with key
  security and privacy roles and responsibilities have the experience, skills,
  and expertise to conduct assigned system development life cycle activities.


  The effective integration of security and privacy requirements into enterprise
  architecture also helps to ensure that important security and privacy
  considerations are addressed throughout the system life cycle and that those
  considerations are directly related to organizational mission and business
  processes. This process also facilitates the integration of the information
  security and privacy architectures into the enterprise architecture,
  consistent with the risk management strategy of the organization. Because the
  system development life cycle involves multiple organizations, (e.g., external
  suppliers, developers, integrators, service providers), acquisition and supply
  chain risk management functions and controls play significant roles in the
  effective management of the system during the life cycle. Related Control(s):

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; system and
  services acquisition procedures; procedures addressing the integration of
  information security and privacy and supply chain risk management into the
  system development life cycle process; system development life cycle
  documentation; organizational risk management strategy; information security
  and privacy risk management strategy documentation; system security plan;
  privacy plan; privacy program plan; enterprise architecture documentation;
  role-based security and privacy training program documentation; data mapping
  documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy responsibilities; organizational personnel with system life cycle
  development responsibilities; organizational personnel with supply chain risk
  management responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for defining and documenting the
  system development life cycle; organizational processes for identifying system
  development life cycle roles and responsibilities; organizational processes
  for integrating information security and privacy and supply chain risk
  management into the system development life cycle; mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing the system development life cycle].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: SA-3.5; as well as
  the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-004678. The resulting
  compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following Rev. 4
  assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance statement:
  SA-3.5. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because of
  the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that
  has not been previously assessed: CCI-004678.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS is itself developed following
  secure SDLC by Defense Unicorns; when the organization develops custom apps to
  run on UDS, they should follow their own secure SDLC requirements.)
