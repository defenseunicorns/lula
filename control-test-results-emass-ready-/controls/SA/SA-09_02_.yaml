control-acronym: "[r5] SA-09(02)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Require providers of the following external system services to identify the
  functions, ports, protocols, and other services required for the use of such
  services: [Assignment: organization-defined external system services].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information from external service providers regarding the specific functions,
  ports, protocols, and services used in the provision of such services can be
  useful when the need arises to understand the trade-offs involved in
  restricting certain functions and services or blocking certain ports and
  protocols. Related Control(s): CM-6, CM-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; supply chain
  risk management policy and procedures; procedures addressing external system
  services; acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system
  service; acquisition documentation; solicitation documentation; service level
  agreements; organizational security requirements and security specifications
  for external service providers; list of required functions, ports, protocols,
  and other services; system security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and service
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; external providers
  of system services].
