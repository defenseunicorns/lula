control-acronym: "[r5] SA-03(02)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Approve, document, and control the use of live data in preproduction
  environments for the system, system component, or system service; and

  (b) Protect preproduction environments for the system, system component, or
  system service at the same impact or classification level as any live data in
  use within the preproduction environments.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Live data is also referred to as operational data. The use of live or
  operational data in preproduction (i.e., development, test, and integration)
  environments can result in significant risks to organizations. In addition,
  the use of personally identifiable information in testing, research, and
  training increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure or misuse of such
  information. Therefore, it is important for the organization to manage any
  additional risks that may result from the use of live or operational data.
  Organizations can minimize such risks by using test or dummy data during the
  design, development, and testing of systems, system components, and system
  services. Risk assessment techniques may be used to determine if the risk of
  using live or operational data is acceptable. Related Control(s): PM-25, RA-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; system and
  services acquisition procedures; procedures addressing the integration of
  security and privacy into the system development life cycle process; system
  development life cycle documentation; security risk assessment documentation;
  privacy impact assessment; privacy risk assessment documentation; system
  security plan; privacy plan; data mapping documentation; personally
  identifiable information processing policy; procedures addressing the
  authority to test with personally identifiable information; procedures
  addressing the minimization of personally identifiable information used in
  testing, training, and research; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy responsibility; organizational personnel with system life cycle
  development responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes the use of live data in
  pre-production environments; mechanisms for protecting live data in
  pre-production environments].
