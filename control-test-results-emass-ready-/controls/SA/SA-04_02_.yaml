control-acronym: "[r5] SA-04(02)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to
  provide design and implementation information for the controls that includes:
  [Selection (one or more): security-relevant external system interfaces;
  high-level design; low-level design; source code or hardware schematics;
  [Assignment: organization-defined design and implementation information]] at
  [Assignment: organization-defined level of detail].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations may require different levels of detail in the documentation for
  the design and implementation of controls in organizational systems, system
  components, or system services based on mission and business requirements,
  requirements for resiliency and trustworthiness, and requirements for analysis
  and testing. Systems can be partitioned into multiple subsystems. Each
  subsystem within the system can contain one or more modules. The high-level
  design for the system is expressed in terms of subsystems and the interfaces
  between subsystems providing security-relevant functionality. The low-level
  design for the system is expressed in terms of modules and the interfaces
  between modules providing security-relevant functionality. Design and
  implementation documentation can include manufacturer, version, serial number,
  verification hash signature, software libraries used, date of purchase or
  download, and the vendor or download source. Source code and hardware
  schematics are referred to as the implementation representation of the system.
  Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; system and
  services acquisition procedures; procedures addressing the integration of
  security requirements, descriptions, and criteria into the acquisition
  process; solicitation documents; acquisition documentation; acquisition
  contracts for the system, system components, or system services; design and
  implementation information for controls employed in the system, system
  component, or system service; system security plan; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with acquisition/contracting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with the responsibility to
  determine system security requirements; system developers or service provider;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for determining the level of
  detail for system design and controls; organizational processes for developing
  acquisition contracts; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the
  development of system design details].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: SA-4(2).1,
  SA-4(2).2, SA-4(2).3, SA-4(2).4, SA-4(2).5, SA-4(2).6. The resulting
  compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following Rev. 4
  assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance statement:
  SA-4(2).3, SA-4(2).4, SA-4(2).5, SA-4(2).6.
