control-acronym: "[r5] SA-03(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Protect system preproduction environments commensurate with risk throughout
  the system development life cycle for the system, system component, or system
  service.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The preproduction environment includes development, test, and integration
  environments. The program protection planning processes established by the
  Department of Defense are examples of managing the preproduction environment
  for defense contractors. Criticality analysis and the application of controls
  on developers also contribute to a more secure system development environment.
  Related Control(s): CM-2, CM-4, RA-3, RA-9, SA-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing the integration of security and supply chain risk management into
  the system development life cycle process; system development life cycle
  documentation; procedures addressing program protection planning; criticality
  analysis results; security and supply chain risk management strategy/program
  documentation; system security plan; supply chain risk management plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security and system
  life cycle development responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for defining and documenting the
  system development life cycle; organizational processes for identifying system
  development life cycle roles and responsibilities; organizational process for
  integrating security risk management into the system development life cycle;
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the system development life cycle].
