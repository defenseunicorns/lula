control-acronym: "[r5] SA-02"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Determine the high-level information security and privacy requirements for
  the system or system service in mission and business process planning;

  b. Determine, document, and allocate the resources required to protect the
  system or system service as part of the organizational capital planning and
  investment control process; and

  c. Establish a discrete line item for information security and privacy in
  organizational programming and budgeting documentation.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Resource allocation for information security and privacy includes funding for
  system and services acquisition, sustainment, and supply chain-related risks
  throughout the system development life cycle. Related Control(s): PL-7, PM-3,
  PM-11, SA-9, SR-3, SR-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; system and
  services acquisition procedures; system and services acquisition strategy and
  plans; procedures addressing the allocation of resources to information
  security and privacy requirements; procedures addressing capital planning and
  investment control; organizational programming and budgeting documentation;
  system security plan; privacy plan; supply chain risk management policy; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with capital planning,
  investment control, organizational programming, and budgeting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities; organizational personnel with supply chain risk
  management responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for determining information
  security and privacy requirements; organizational processes for capital
  planning, programming, and budgeting; mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing organizational capital planning, programming, and budgeting].

test-results: >-
  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: SA-2.5, SA-2.6; as
  well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-004667, CCI-004668.
  The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following
  Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance
  statement: SA-2.5, SA-2.6. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because of the addition of a new security requirement to the
  assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed: CCI-004667,
  CCI-004668.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (This is an organizational level
  control that is related to mission resource planning which happens outside of
  the UDS boundary.)
