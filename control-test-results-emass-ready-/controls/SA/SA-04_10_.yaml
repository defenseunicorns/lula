control-acronym: "[r5] SA-04(10)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Employ only information technology products on the FIPS 201-approved products
  list for Personal Identity Verification (PIV) capability implemented within
  organizational systems.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Products on the FIPS 201-approved products list meet NIST requirements for
  Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors. PIV
  cards are used for multi-factor authentication in systems and organizations.
  Related Control(s): IA-2, IA-8, PM-9.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Supply chain risk management plan; system and services
  acquisition policy; procedures addressing the integration of security
  requirements, descriptions, and criteria into the acquisition process;
  solicitation documentation; acquisition documentation; acquisition contracts
  for the system, system component, or system service; service level agreements;
  FIPS 201 approved products list; system security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with acquisition/contracting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with the responsibility for
  determining system security requirements; organizational personnel with the
  responsibility for ensuring that only FIPS 201- approved products are
  implemented; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for selecting and employing FIPS
  201-approved products].
