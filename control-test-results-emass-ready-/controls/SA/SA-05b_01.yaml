control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Obtain or develop administrator documentation for the system, system
  component, or system service that describes:

  1. Secure configuration, installation, and operation of the system, component,
  or service;

  2. Effective use and maintenance of security and privacy functions and
  mechanisms; and

  3. Known vulnerabilities regarding configuration and use of administrative or
  privileged functions;

  b. Obtain or develop user documentation for the system, system component, or
  system service that describes:

  1. User-accessible security and privacy functions and mechanisms and how to
  effectively use those functions and mechanisms;

  2. Methods for user interaction, which enables individuals to use the system,
  component, or service in a more secure manner and protect individual privacy;
  and

  3. User responsibilities in maintaining the security of the system, component,
  or service and privacy of individuals;

  c. Document attempts to obtain system, system component, or system service
  documentation when such documentation is either unavailable or nonexistent and
  take [Assignment: organization-defined actions] in response; and

  d. Distribute documentation to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
  roles].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  System documentation helps personnel understand the implementation and
  operation of controls. Organizations consider establishing specific measures
  to determine the quality and completeness of the content provided. System
  documentation may be used to support the management of supply chain risk,
  incident response, and other functions. Personnel or roles that require
  documentation include system owners, system security officers, and system
  administrators. Attempts to obtain documentation include contacting
  manufacturers or suppliers and conducting web-based searches. The inability to
  obtain documentation may occur due to the age of the system or component or
  the lack of support from developers and contractors. When documentation cannot
  be obtained, organizations may need to recreate the documentation if it is
  essential to the implementation or operation of the controls. The protection
  provided for the documentation is commensurate with the security category or
  classification of the system. Documentation that addresses system
  vulnerabilities may require an increased level of protection. Secure operation
  of the system includes initially starting the system and resuming secure
  system operation after a lapse in system operation. Related Control(s): CM-4,
  CM-6, CM-7, CM-8, PL-2, PL-4, PL-8, PS-2, SA-3, SA-4, SA-8, SA-9, SA-10,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; system and
  services acquisition procedures; procedures addressing system documentation;
  system documentation, including administrator and user guides; system design
  documentation; records documenting attempts to obtain unavailable or
  nonexistent system documentation; list of actions to be taken in response to
  documented attempts to obtain system, system component, or system service
  documentation; risk management strategy documentation; system security plan;
  privacy plan; privacy impact assessment; privacy risk assessment
  documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with acquisition/contracting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities; system administrators; organizational personnel
  responsible for operating, using, and/or maintaining the system; system
  developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for obtaining, protecting, and
  distributing system administrator and user documentation].

  Determine if:

  - user documentation for the system, system component, or system service that
  describes user-accessible security functions and mechanisms is obtained or
  developed.

  - user documentation for the system, system component, or system service that
  describes how to effectively use those (user-accessible security) functions
  and mechanisms is obtained or developed.

  - user documentation for the system, system component, or system service that
  describes user-accessible privacy functions and mechanisms is obtained or
  developed.

  - user documentation for the system, system component, or system service that
  describes how to effectively use those (user-accessible privacy) functions and
  mechanisms is obtained or developed.

test-results: UDS provides free documentation on the UDS doc site,
  https://uds.defenseunicorns.com. The UDS doc site goes into details on general
  UDS information, bundles and configuration, command line interface, security
  and identity, and even includes tutorials. Since UDS core utilizes a range of
  open source project organizations can also take advantage of the wealth of
  community provided documentation. As part of acquiring UDS, an organization
  has access to documentation of each component (Keycloak manuals, Istio docs,
  etc.). The control expects that the system comes with sufficient documentation
  for its operation and security. In this case, UDSâ€™s components are
  well-documented by their communities, and Defense Unicorns integration
  documentation specific to UDS.
