control-acronym: "[r5] SA-21"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Require that the developer of [Assignment: organization-defined system, system
  component, or system service]:

  a. Has appropriate access authorizations as determined by assigned
  [Assignment: organization-defined official government duties]; and

  b. Satisfies the following additional personnel screening criteria:
  [Assignment: organization-defined additional personnel screening criteria].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Developer screening is directed at external developers. Internal developer
  screening is addressed by PS-3. Because the system, system component, or
  system service may be used in critical activities essential to the national or
  economic security interests of the United States, organizations have a strong
  interest in ensuring that developers are trustworthy. The degree of trust
  required of developers may need to be consistent with that of the individuals
  who access the systems, system components, or system services once deployed.
  Authorization and personnel screening criteria include clearances, background
  checks, citizenship, and nationality. Developer trustworthiness may also
  include a review and analysis of company ownership and relationships that the
  company has with entities that may potentially affect the quality and
  reliability of the systems, components, or services being developed.
  Satisfying the required access authorizations and personnel screening criteria
  includes providing a list of all individuals who are authorized to perform
  development activities on the selected system, system component, or system
  service so that organizations can validate that the developer has satisfied
  the authorization and screening requirements. Related Control(s): PS-2, PS-3,
  PS-6, PS-7, SA-4, SR-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; personnel
  security policy and procedures; procedures addressing personnel screening;
  system design documentation; acquisition documentation; service level
  agreements; acquisition contracts for developer services; system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; list of appropriate access
  authorizations required by the developers of the system; personnel screening
  criteria and associated documentation; system security plan; supply chain risk
  management plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and service
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel responsible for developer
  screening].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for developer screening;
  mechanisms supporting developer screening].
