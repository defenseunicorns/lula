  Description:

  Apply the following systems security and privacy engineering principles in the
  specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the
  system and system components: [Assignment: organization-defined systems
  security and privacy engineering principles].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Systems security and privacy engineering principles are closely related to and
  implemented throughout the system development life cycle (see SA-3).
  Organizations can apply systems security and privacy engineering principles to
  new systems under development or to systems undergoing upgrades. For existing
  systems, organizations apply systems security and privacy engineering
  principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given
  the current state of hardware, software, and firmware components within those
  systems.


  The application of systems security and privacy engineering principles helps
  organizations develop trustworthy, secure, and resilient systems and reduces
  the susceptibility to disruptions, hazards, threats, and the creation of
  privacy problems for individuals. Examples of system security engineering
  principles include: developing layered protections; establishing security and
  privacy policies, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design and
  development; incorporating security and privacy requirements into the system
  development life cycle; delineating physical and logical security boundaries;
  ensuring that developers are trained on how to build secure software;
  tailoring controls to meet organizational needs; and performing threat
  modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors and patterns,
  design patterns, and compensating controls needed to mitigate risk.


  Organizations that apply systems security and privacy engineering concepts and
  principles can facilitate the development of trustworthy, secure systems,
  system components, and system services; reduce risk to acceptable levels; and
  make informed risk management decisions. System security engineering
  principles can also be used to protect against certain supply chain risks,
  including incorporating tamper-resistant hardware into a design. Related

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; system and
  services acquisition procedures; assessment and authorization procedures;
  procedures addressing security and privacy engineering principles used in the
  specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the
  system; system design documentation; security and privacy requirements and
  specifications for the system; system security plan; privacy plan; privacy
  impact assessment; privacy risk assessment documentation; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with acquisition/contracting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities; organizational personnel with system specification,
  design, development, implementation, and modification responsibilities; system
  developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for applying security and privacy
  engineering principles in system specification, design, development,
  implementation, and modification; mechanisms supporting the application of
  security and privacy engineering principles in system specification, design,
  development, implementation, and modification].

test-results: "UDS was designed with security engineering principles (like least
  privilege, defense-in-depth, fail-safe defaults) from the ground up. For
  instance, zero trust networking (all internal comms encrypted and
  authenticated) is implemented via Istio, least privilege via RBAC and minimal
  container images, segmentation via NeuVector, and so on. By using UDS, an
  organization is effectively implementing a system that adheres to robust
  security best practices by default. This addresses SA-8, which calls for
  applying security design principles in the implementation of the system.
  Instead of building a system from scratch, the organization adopts UDS which
  already incorporates those principles. Therefore, UDS strongly supports SA-8:
  its architecture is an embodiment of secure design (modularity, layering,
  least privilege, etc.), ensuring the system is resilient and easier to
  protect."

  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: SA-8.1, SA-8.2, SA-8.3, SA-8.4, SA-8.5; as well as the following
  Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-004712, CCI-004713, CCI-004714, CCI-004715,
  CCI-004716. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  of the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that
  has not been previously assessed: CCI-004712, CCI-004713, CCI-004714,
  CCI-004715, CCI-004716."
