control-acronym: "[r5] SA-15(03)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to
  perform a criticality analysis:

  (a) At the following decision points in the system development life cycle:
  [Assignment: organization-defined decision points in the system development
  life cycle]; and

  (b) At the following level of rigor: [Assignment: organization-defined breadth
  and depth of criticality analysis].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Criticality analysis performed by the developer provides input to the
  criticality analysis performed by organizations. Developer input is essential
  to organizational criticality analysis because organizations may not have
  access to detailed design documentation for system components that are
  developed as commercial off-the-shelf products. Such design documentation
  includes functional specifications, high-level designs, low-level designs,
  source code, and hardware schematics. Criticality analysis is important for
  organizational systems that are designated as high value assets. High value
  assets can be moderate- or high-impact systems due to heightened adversarial
  interest or potential adverse effects on the federal enterprise. Developer
  input is especially important when organizations conduct supply chain
  criticality analyses. Related Control(s): RA-9.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Supply chain risk management plan; system and services
  acquisition policy; procedures addressing development process, standards, and
  tools; procedures addressing criticality analysis requirements for the system,
  system component, or system service; solicitation documentation; acquisition
  documentation; service level agreements; acquisition contracts for the system,
  system component, or system service; criticality analysis documentation;
  business impact analysis documentation; software development life cycle
  documentation; system security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and service
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel responsible for performing
  criticality analysis; system developer; organizational personnel with supply
  chain risk management responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for performing criticality
  analysis; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing criticality analysis].
