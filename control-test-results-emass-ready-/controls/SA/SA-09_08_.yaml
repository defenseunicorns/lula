control-information: >-
  Description:

  Restrict the geographic location of information processing and data storage to
  facilities located within in the legal jurisdictional boundary of the United
  States.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The geographic location of information processing and data storage can have a
  direct impact on the ability of organizations to successfully execute their
  mission and business functions. A compromise or breach of high impact
  information and systems can have severe or catastrophic adverse impacts on
  organizational assets and operations, individuals, other organizations, and
  the Nation. Restricting the processing and storage of high-impact information
  to facilities within the legal jurisdictional boundary of the United States
  provides greater control over such processing and storage. Related Control(s):
  SA-5, SR-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
