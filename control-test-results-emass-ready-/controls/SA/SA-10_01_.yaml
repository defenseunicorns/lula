control-acronym: "[r5] SA-10(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to
  enable integrity verification of software and firmware components.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Software and firmware integrity verification allows organizations to detect
  unauthorized changes to software and firmware components using
  developer-provided tools, techniques, and mechanisms. The integrity checking
  mechanisms can also address counterfeiting of software and firmware
  components. Organizations verify the integrity of software and firmware
  components, for example, through secure one-way hashes provided by developers.
  Delivered software and firmware components also include any updates to such
  components. Related Control(s): SI-7, SR-11.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing system developer configuration management; solicitation
  documentation; acquisition documentation; service level agreements;
  acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service;
  system developer configuration management plan; software and firmware
  integrity verification records; system change authorization records; change
  control records; configuration management records; system security plan;
  supply chain risk management plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and service
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with configuration
  management responsibilities; system developers; organizational personnel with
  supply chain risk management responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for monitoring developer
  configuration management; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the
  monitoring of developer configuration management].

test-results: UDS implements integrity verification mechanisms for software and
  firmware components across several layers of the stack. Grype performs
  vulnerability scanning and software composition analysis, while OpenTofu
  ensures infrastructure-as-code (IaC) integrity. Zarf secures the supply chain
  by cryptographically signing software bundles and verifying authenticity
  before deployment, with SBOM tracking to detect unauthorized modifications.
  Istio enforces mutual TLS (mTLS) for secure service communication, and
  NeuVector provides runtime security by blocking unsigned or tampered
  workloads. Vector and Loki enable immutable logging and tamper detection.
  Velero ensures secure backup integrity with cryptographic hashing for tamper
  detection before restoration. These combined controls safeguard the integrity
  of software and firmware, ensuring a secure and compliant deployment.
