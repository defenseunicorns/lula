control-information: >-
  Description:

  Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to
  identify the functions, ports, protocols, and services intended for
  organizational use.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services early in the
  system development life cycle (e.g., during the initial requirements
  definition and design stages) allows organizations to influence the design of
  the system, system component, or system service. This early involvement in the
  system development life cycle helps organizations avoid or minimize the use of
  functions, ports, protocols, or services that pose unnecessarily high risks
  and understand the trade-offs involved in blocking specific ports, protocols,
  or services or requiring system service providers to do so. Early
  identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services avoids costly
  retrofitting of controls after the system, component, or system service has
  been implemented. SA-9 describes the requirements for external system
  services. Organizations identify which functions, ports, protocols, and
  services are provided from external sources. Related Control(s): CM-7, SA-9.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing the integration of security requirements, descriptions, and
  criteria into the acquisition process; system design documentation; system
  documentation, including functions, ports, protocols, and services intended
  for organizational use; acquisition contracts for systems or services;
  acquisition documentation; solicitation documentation; service level
  agreements; organizational security requirements, descriptions, and criteria
  for developers of systems, system components, and system services; system
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with acquisition/contracting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with the responsibility for
  determining system security requirements; system/network administrators;
  organizational personnel operating, using, and/or maintaining the system;
  system developers; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].
