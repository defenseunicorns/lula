control-acronym: "[r5] SA-09"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Require that providers of external system services comply with
  organizational security and privacy requirements and employ the following
  controls: [Assignment: organization-defined controls];

  b. Define and document organizational oversight and user roles and
  responsibilities with regard to external system services; and

  c. Employ the following processes, methods, and techniques to monitor control
  compliance by external service providers on an ongoing basis: [Assignment:
  organization-defined processes, methods, and techniques].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  External system services are provided by an external provider, and the
  organization has no direct control over the implementation of the required
  controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. Organizations establish
  relationships with external service providers in a variety of ways, including
  through business partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements, lines of
  business arrangements, licensing agreements, joint ventures, and supply chain
  exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external
  system services remains with authorizing officials. For services external to
  organizations, a chain of trust requires that organizations establish and
  retain a certain level of confidence that each provider in the
  consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services
  rendered. The extent and nature of this chain of trust vary based on
  relationships between organizations and the external providers. Organizations
  document the basis for the trust relationships so that the relationships can
  be monitored. External system services documentation includes government,
  service providers, end user security roles and responsibilities, and
  service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define the expectations of
  performance for implemented controls, describe measurable outcomes, and
  identify remedies and response requirements for identified instances of
  noncompliance. Related Control(s): AC-20, CA-3, CP-2, IR-4, IR-7, PL-10,
  PL-11, PS-7, SA-2, SA-4, SR-3, SR-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; system and
  services acquisition procedures; procedures addressing methods and techniques
  for monitoring control compliance by external service providers of system
  services; acquisition documentation; contracts; service level agreements;
  interagency agreements; licensing agreements; list of organizational security
  and privacy requirements for external provider services; control assessment
  results or reports from external providers of system services; system security
  plan; privacy plan; supply chain risk management plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with acquisition
  responsibilities; external providers of system services; organizational
  personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities;
  organizational personnel with supply chain risk management responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for monitoring security and
  privacy control compliance by external service providers on an ongoing basis;
  mechanisms for monitoring security and privacy control compliance by external
  service providers on an ongoing basis].
