control-acronym: "[r5] SA-04"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Include the following requirements, descriptions, and criteria, explicitly or
  by reference, using [Selection (one or more): standardized contract language;
  [Assignment: organization-defined contract language]] in the acquisition
  contract for the system, system component, or system service:

  a. Security and privacy functional requirements;

  b. Strength of mechanism requirements;

  c. Security and privacy assurance requirements;

  d. Controls needed to satisfy the security and privacy requirements.

  e. Security and privacy documentation requirements;

  f. Requirements for protecting security and privacy documentation;

  g. Description of the system development environment and environment in which
  the system is intended to operate;

  h. Allocation of responsibility or identification of parties responsible for
  information security, privacy, and supply chain risk management; and

  i. Acceptance criteria.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Security and privacy functional requirements are typically derived from the
  high-level security and privacy requirements described in SA-2. The derived
  requirements include security and privacy capabilities, functions, and
  mechanisms. Strength requirements associated with such capabilities,
  functions, and mechanisms include degree of correctness, completeness,
  resistance to tampering or bypass, and resistance to direct attack. Assurance
  requirements include development processes, procedures, and methodologies as
  well as the evidence from development and assessment activities that provide
  grounds for confidence that the required functionality is implemented and
  possesses the required strength of mechanism. SP 800-160-1 describes the
  process of requirements engineering as part of the system development life
  cycle.


  Controls can be viewed as descriptions of the safeguards and protection
  capabilities appropriate for achieving the particular security and privacy
  objectives of the organization and for reflecting the security and privacy
  requirements of stakeholders. Controls are selected and implemented in order
  to satisfy system requirements and include developer and organizational
  responsibilities. Controls can include technical, administrative, and physical
  aspects. In some cases, the selection and implementation of a control may
  necessitate additional specification by the organization in the form of
  derived requirements or instantiated control parameter values. The derived
  requirements and control parameter values may be necessary to provide the
  appropriate level of implementation detail for controls within the system
  development life cycle.


  Security and privacy documentation requirements address all stages of the
  system development life cycle. Documentation provides user and administrator
  guidance for the implementation and operation of controls. The level of detail
  required in such documentation is based on the security categorization or
  classification level of the system and the degree to which organizations
  depend on the capabilities, functions, or mechanisms to meet risk response
  expectations. Requirements can include mandated configuration settings that
  specify allowed functions, ports, protocols, and services. Acceptance criteria
  for systems, system components, and system services are defined in the same
  manner as the criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; system and
  services acquisition procedures; procedures addressing the integration of
  information security and privacy and supply chain risk management into the
  acquisition process; configuration management plan; acquisition contracts for
  the system, system component, or system service; system design documentation;
  system security plan; supply chain risk management plan; privacy plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with acquisition/contracting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with supply chain risk management responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for determining system security
  and privacy functional, strength, and assurance requirements; organizational
  processes for developing acquisition contracts; mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing acquisitions and the inclusion of security and privacy
  requirements in contracts].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: SA-4.6; as well as
  the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-004686. The resulting
  compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following Rev. 4
  assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance statement:
  SA-4.6. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because of
  the addition of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that
  has not been previously assessed: CCI-004686.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Organizational level control dealing
  with the system and components acquisition.)
