control-information: >-
  Description:

  Implement the privacy principle of minimization using [Assignment:
  organization-defined processes].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The principle of minimization states that organizations should only process
  personally identifiable information that is directly relevant and necessary to
  accomplish an authorized purpose and should only maintain personally
  identifiable information for as long as is necessary to accomplish the
  purpose. Organizations have processes in place, consistent with applicable
  laws and policies, to implement the principle of minimization. Related
  Control(s): PE-8, PM-25, SC-42, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; system and
  services acquisition procedures; personally identifiable information
  processing policy; procedures addressing the minimization of personally
  identifiable information in system design; system design documentation; system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; change control records;
  information security and privacy requirements and specifications for the
  system; system security and privacy architecture; system security plan;
  privacy plan; privacy impact assessment; privacy risk assessment
  documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy responsibilities; organizational personnel with system
  specification, design, development, implementation, and modification
  responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for applying the privacy design
  principle of minimization in system specification, design, development,
  implementation, and modification; mechanisms supporting the application of the
  security design principle of sufficient documentation in system specification,
  design, development, implementation, and modification; mechanisms that enforce
  security and privacy policy; organizational processes for managing change
  configuration; mechanisms supporting configuration control].
