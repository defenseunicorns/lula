control-acronym: "[r5] SA-04(07)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  (a) Limit the use of commercially provided information assurance and
  information assurance-enabled information technology products to those
  products that have been successfully evaluated against a National Information
  Assurance partnership (NIAP)-approved Protection Profile for a specific
  technology type, if such a profile exists; and

  (b) Require, if no NIAP-approved Protection Profile exists for a specific
  technology type but a commercially provided information technology product
  relies on cryptographic functionality to enforce its security policy, that the
  cryptographic module is FIPS-validated or NSA-approved.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  See NIAP CCEVS for additional information on NIAP. See NIST CMVP for
  additional information on FIPS-validated cryptographic modules. Related
  Control(s): IA-7, SC-12, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Supply chain risk management plan; system and services
  acquisition policy; procedures addressing the integration of security
  requirements, descriptions, and criteria into the acquisition process;
  solicitation documents; acquisition documentation; acquisition contracts for
  the system, system component, or system service; list of deployed IT
  products/solutions; NAIP-approved protection profiles; FIPS-validation
  information for cryptographic functionality; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with acquisition/contracting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with the responsibility for
  determining system security requirements; organizational personnel responsible
  for ensuring that information assurance products have been evaluated against a
  NIAP-approved protection profile or for ensuring products relying on
  cryptographic functionality are FIPS-validated; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for selecting and employing
  products/services evaluated against a NIAP-approved protection profile or
  FIPS-validated products].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: SA-4(7).1. The
  resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following
  Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance
  statement: SA-4(7).1.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS is not a NIAP evaluated product
  because it uses FIPS-validated modules.)
