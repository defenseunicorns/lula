control-information: >-
  Description:

  Establish, document, and maintain trust relationships with external service
  providers based on the following requirements, properties, factors, or
  conditions: [Assignment: organization-defined security and privacy
  requirements, properties, factors, or conditions defining acceptable trust
  relationships].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Trust relationships between organizations and external service providers
  reflect the degree of confidence that the risk from using external services is
  at an acceptable level. Trust relationships can help organizations gain
  increased levels of confidence that service providers are providing adequate
  protection for the services rendered and can also be useful when conducting
  incident response or when planning for upgrades or obsolescence. Trust
  relationships can be complicated due to the potentially large number of
  entities participating in the consumer-provider interactions, subordinate
  relationships and levels of trust, and types of interactions between the
  parties. In some cases, the degree of trust is based on the level of control
  that organizations can exert on external service providers regarding the
  controls necessary for the protection of the service, information, or
  individual privacy and the evidence brought forth as to the effectiveness of
  the implemented controls. The level of control is established by the terms and
  conditions of the contracts or service-level agreements. Related Control(s):
  SR-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; system and
  services acquisition procedures; acquisition contracts for the system, system
  component, or system service; acquisition documentation; solicitation
  documentation; service level agreements; memorandum of understanding;
  memorandum of agreements; list of organizational security and privacy
  requirements, properties, factors, or conditions for external provider
  services; documentation of trust relationships with external service
  providers; system security plan; privacy plan; supply chain risk management
  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with acquisition
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities; external providers of system services;
  organizational personnel with supply chain risk management responsibilities].
