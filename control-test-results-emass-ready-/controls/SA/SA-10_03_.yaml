control-acronym: "[r5] SA-10(03)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to
  enable integrity verification of hardware components.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Hardware integrity verification allows organizations to detect unauthorized
  changes to hardware components using developer-provided tools, techniques,
  methods, and mechanisms. Organizations may verify the integrity of hardware
  components with hard-to-copy labels, verifiable serial numbers provided by
  developers, and by requiring the use of anti-tamper technologies. Delivered
  hardware components also include hardware and firmware updates to such
  components. Related Control(s): SI-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing system developer configuration management; solicitation
  documentation; acquisition documentation; service level agreements;
  acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service;
  system developer configuration management plan; hardware integrity
  verification records; system security plan; supply chain risk management plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and service
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with configuration
  management responsibilities; system developers; organizational personnel with
  supply chain risk management responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for monitoring developer
  configuration management; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the
  monitoring of developer configuration management].
