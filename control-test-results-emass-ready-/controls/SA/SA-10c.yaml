control-acronym: "[r5] SA-10"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to:

  a. Perform configuration management during system, component, or service
  [Selection (one or more): design; development; implementation; operation;
  disposal];

  b. Document, manage, and control the integrity of changes to [Assignment:
  organization-defined configuration items under configuration management];

  c. Implement only organization-approved changes to the system, component, or
  service;

  d. Document approved changes to the system, component, or service and the
  potential security and privacy impacts of such changes; and

  e. Track security flaws and flaw resolution within the system, component, or
  service and report findings to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations consider the quality and completeness of configuration
  management activities conducted by developers as direct evidence of applying
  effective security controls. Controls include protecting the master copies of
  material used to generate security-relevant portions of the system hardware,
  software, and firmware from unauthorized modification or destruction.
  Maintaining the integrity of changes to the system, system component, or
  system service requires strict configuration control throughout the system
  development life cycle to track authorized changes and prevent unauthorized
  changes.


  The configuration items that are placed under configuration management include
  the formal model; the functional, high-level, and low-level design
  specifications; other design data; implementation documentation; source code
  and hardware schematics; the current running version of the object code; tools
  for comparing new versions of security-relevant hardware descriptions and
  source code with previous versions; and test fixtures and documentation.
  Depending on the mission and business needs of organizations and the nature of
  the contractual relationships in place, developers may provide configuration
  management support during the operations and maintenance stage of the system
  development life cycle. Related Control(s): CM-2, CM-3, CM-4, CM-7, CM-9,
  SA-4, SA-5, SA-8, SA-15, SI-2, SR-3, SR-4, SR-5, SR-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing system developer configuration management; solicitation
  documentation; acquisition documentation; service level agreements;
  acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service;
  system developer configuration management plan; security flaw and flaw
  resolution tracking records; system change authorization records; change
  control records; configuration management records; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and service
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with configuration
  management responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for monitoring developer
  configuration management; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the
  monitoring of developer configuration management].

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (This control is about the Defense

  provided updates to the software but the organization is not directly involved
  in the configuration management during the development of UDS.)
