  Description:

  Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to
  employ static code analysis tools to identify common flaws and document the
  results of the analysis.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Static code analysis provides a technology and methodology for security
  reviews and includes checking for weaknesses in the code as well as for the
  incorporation of libraries or other included code with known vulnerabilities
  or that are out-of-date and not supported. Static code analysis can be used to
  identify vulnerabilities and enforce secure coding practices. It is most
  effective when used early in the development process, when each code change
  can automatically be scanned for potential weaknesses. Static code analysis
  can provide clear remediation guidance and identify defects for developers to
  fix. Evidence of the correct implementation of static analysis can include
  aggregate defect density for critical defect types, evidence that defects were
  inspected by developers or security professionals, and evidence that defects
  were remediated. A high density of ignored findings, commonly referred to as
  false positives, indicates a potential problem with the analysis process or
  the analysis tool. In such cases, organizations weigh the validity of the
  evidence against evidence from other sources. Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; system and
  services acquisition procedures; procedures addressing system developer
  security testing; procedures addressing flaw remediation; solicitation
  documentation; acquisition documentation; service level agreements;
  acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system service;
  security and privacy architecture; system design documentation; system
  developer security and privacy assessment plans; results of system developer
  security and privacy assessments; security flaw and remediation tracking
  records; system security plan; privacy plan; privacy impact assessment;
  privacy risk assessment documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and service
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with developer security
  and privacy testing responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  configuration management responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for monitoring developer security
  testing and evaluation; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the
  monitoring of developer security testing and evaluation; static code analysis
  tools].

  Determine if:

  - the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required
  to employ static code analysis tools to identify common flaws.

  - the developer of the system, system component, or system service is required
  to employ static code analysis tools to document the results of the analysis.
