control-acronym: "[r5] SA-10(07)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Require [Assignment: organization-defined security and privacy
  representatives] to be included in the [Assignment: organization-defined
  configuration change management and control process].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information security and privacy representatives can include system security
  officers, senior agency information security officers, senior agency officials
  for privacy, and system privacy officers. Representation by personnel with
  information security and privacy expertise is important because changes to
  system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of which may be
  security- or privacy-relevant. Detecting such changes early in the process can
  help avoid unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the
  security and privacy posture of systems. The configuration change management
  and control process in this control enhancement refers to the change
  management and control process defined by organizations in SA-10b. Related
  Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; system and
  services acquisition procedures; configuration management policy;
  configuration management plan; solicitation documentation requiring
  representatives for security and privacy; acquisition documentation; service
  level agreements; acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or
  system service; system developer configuration management plan; change control
  records; configuration management records; system security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and service
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security and privacy responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  configuration management responsibilities; system developers].
