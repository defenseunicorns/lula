  Description:

  Plan for and implement a technology refresh schedule for the system throughout
  the system development life cycle.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Technology refresh planning may encompass hardware, software, firmware,
  processes, personnel skill sets, suppliers, service providers, and facilities.
  The use of obsolete or nearing obsolete technology may increase the security
  and privacy risks associated with unsupported components, counterfeit or
  repurposed components, components unable to implement security or privacy
  requirements, slow or inoperable components, components from untrusted
  sources, inadvertent personnel error, or increased complexity. Technology
  refreshes typically occur during the operations and maintenance stage of the
  system development life cycle. Related Control(s): MA-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; system and
  services acquisition procedures; procedures addressing technology refresh
  planning and implementation; system development life cycle documentation;
  technology refresh schedule; security risk assessment documentation; privacy
  impact assessment; privacy risk assessment documentation; system security
  plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  and privacy responsibilities; organizational personnel with system life cycle
  development responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for defining and documenting the
  system development life cycle; organizational processes for identifying system
  development life cycle roles and responsibilities; organizational processes
  for integrating security and privacy risk management into the system
  development life cycle; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the system
  development life cycle].
