control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Replace system components when support for the components is no longer
  available from the developer, vendor, or manufacturer; or

  b. Provide the following options for alternative sources for continued support
  for unsupported components [Selection (one or more): in-house support;
  [Assignment: organization-defined support from external providers]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Support for system components includes software patches, firmware updates,
  replacement parts, and maintenance contracts. An example of unsupported
  components includes when vendors no longer provide critical software patches
  or product updates, which can result in an opportunity for adversaries to
  exploit weaknesses in the installed components. Exceptions to replacing
  unsupported system components include systems that provide critical mission or
  business capabilities where newer technologies are not available or where the
  systems are so isolated that installing replacement components is not an
  option.


  Alternative sources for support address the need to provide continued support
  for system components that are no longer supported by the original
  manufacturers, developers, or vendors when such components remain essential to
  organizational mission and business functions. If necessary, organizations can
  establish in-house support by developing customized patches for critical
  software components or, alternatively, obtain the services of external
  providers who provide ongoing support for the designated unsupported
  components through contractual relationships. Such contractual relationships
  can include open-source software value-added vendors. The increased risk of
  using unsupported system components can be mitigated, for example, by
  prohibiting the connection of such components to public or uncontrolled
  networks, or implementing other forms of isolation. Related Control(s): PL-2,
  SA-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing the replacement or continued use of unsupported system components;
  documented evidence of replacing unsupported system components; documented
  approvals (including justification) for the continued use of unsupported
  system components; system security plan; supply chain risk management plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and service
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with the responsibility
  for the system development life cycle; organizational personnel responsible
  for component replacement].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for replacing unsupported system
  components; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the replacement of
  unsupported system components].

test-results: UDS maintainers and the operations team actively manage components
  to avoid using outdated or unsupported software. UDS is based on modern
  open-source projects with active support. If a component nears end-of-life,
  the UDS project will incorporate a supported alternative or newer version in
  its package. Because everything is containerized, updating a component to a
  supported version is straightforward by deploying a new container image.
  Defense Unicorns provides regularly updated container images known as Unicorn
  Images which are regularly scanned and hardened as a service to the
  organization.
