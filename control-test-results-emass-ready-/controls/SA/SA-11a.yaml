control-acronym: "[r5] SA-11"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service, at
  all post-design stages of the system development life cycle, to:

  a. Develop and implement a plan for ongoing security and privacy control
  assessments;

  b. Perform [Selection (one or more): unit; integration; system; regression]
  testing/evaluation [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] at
  [Assignment: organization-defined depth and coverage];

  c. Produce evidence of the execution of the assessment plan and the results of
  the testing and evaluation;

  d. Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process; and

  e. Correct flaws identified during testing and evaluation.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Developmental testing and evaluation confirms that the required controls are
  implemented correctly, operating as intended, enforcing the desired security
  and privacy policies, and meeting established security and privacy
  requirements. Security properties of systems and the privacy of individuals
  may be affected by the interconnection of system components or changes to
  those components. The interconnections or changes—including upgrading or
  replacing applications, operating systems, and firmware—may adversely affect
  previously implemented controls. Ongoing assessment during development allows
  for additional types of testing and evaluation that developers can conduct to
  reduce or eliminate potential flaws. Testing custom software applications may
  require approaches such as manual code review, security architecture review,
  and penetration testing, as well as and static analysis, dynamic analysis,
  binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three analysis approaches.


  Developers can use the analysis approaches, along with security
  instrumentation and fuzzing, in a variety of tools and in source code reviews.
  The security and privacy assessment plans include the specific activities that
  developers plan to carry out, including the types of analyses, testing,
  evaluation, and reviews of software and firmware components; the degree of
  rigor to be applied; the frequency of the ongoing testing and evaluation; and
  the types of artifacts produced during those processes. The depth of testing
  and evaluation refers to the rigor and level of detail associated with the
  assessment process. The coverage of testing and evaluation refers to the scope
  (i.e., number and type) of the artifacts included in the assessment process.
  Contracts specify the acceptance criteria for security and privacy assessment
  plans, flaw remediation processes, and the evidence that the plans and
  processes have been diligently applied. Methods for reviewing and protecting
  assessment plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the
  security category or classification level of the system. Contracts may specify
  protection requirements for documentation. Related Control(s): CA-2, CA-7,
  CM-4, SA-3, SA-4, SA-5, SA-8, SA-15, SA-17, SI-2, SR-5, SR-6, SR-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: SA-11.1, SA-11.2;
  as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements: CCI-004798, CCI-004799.
  The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because the following
  Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test result/compliance
  statement: SA-11.1, SA-11.2. The resulting compliance status was set to
  non-compliant because of the addition of a new security requirement to the
  assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed: CCI-004798,
  CCI-004799.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (This pertains to the UDS developers
  performing code reviews, security testing, etc. The UDS product comes tested;
  the user of UDS does not control the internal development processes of those
  components, aside from applying updates when available. Several UDS components
  are widely used open source project; that have their own testing regimes (unit
  tests, integration tests, possibly security audits by the community).
