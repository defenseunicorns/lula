control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to
  follow a documented development process that:

  1. Explicitly addresses security and privacy requirements;

  2. Identifies the standards and tools used in the development process;

  3. Documents the specific tool options and tool configurations used in the
  development process; and

  4. Documents, manages, and ensures the integrity of changes to the process
  and/or tools used in development; and

  b. Review the development process, standards, tools, tool options, and tool
  configurations [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to determine if
  the process, standards, tools, tool options and tool configurations selected
  and employed can satisfy the following security and privacy requirements:
  [Assignment: organization-defined security and privacy requirements].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Development tools include programming languages and computer-aided design
  systems. Reviews of development processes include the use of maturity models
  to determine the potential effectiveness of such processes. Maintaining the
  integrity of changes to tools and processes facilitates effective supply chain
  risk assessment and mitigation. Such integrity requires configuration control
  throughout the system development life cycle to track authorized changes and
  prevent unauthorized changes. Related Control(s): MA-6, SA-3, SA-4, SA-8,
  SA-10, SA-11, SR-3, SR-4, SR-5, SR-6, SR-9.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; system and
  services acquisition procedures; procedures addressing development process,
  standards, and tools; procedures addressing the integration of security and
  privacy requirements during the development process; solicitation
  documentation; acquisition documentation; critical component inventory
  documentation; service level agreements; acquisition contracts for the system,
  system component, or system service; system developer documentation listing
  tool options/configuration guides; configuration management policy;
  configuration management records; documentation of development process reviews
  using maturity models; change control records; configuration control records;
  documented reviews of the development process, standards, tools, and tool
  options/configurations; system security plan; privacy plan; privacy impact
  assessment; privacy risk assessment documentation; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and service
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: SA-15.1, SA-15.6,
  SA-15.7, SA-15.8. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant
  because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test
  result/compliance statement: SA-15.1, SA-15.6, SA-15.7, SA-15.8.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS users benefit from secure
  development practices of UDS, but they don't enforce them. If the organization
  builds anything on top of UDS, they should apply their own secure SDLC
  standards.)
