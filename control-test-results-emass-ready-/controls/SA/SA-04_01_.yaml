control-acronym: "[r5] SA-04(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to
  provide a description of the functional properties of the controls to be
  implemented.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Functional properties of security and privacy controls describe the
  functionality (i.e., security or privacy capability, functions, or mechanisms)
  visible at the interfaces of the controls and specifically exclude
  functionality and data structures internal to the operation of the controls.
  Related Control(s): None.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; system and
  services acquisition procedures; procedures addressing the integration of
  security and privacy requirements, descriptions, and criteria into the
  acquisition process; solicitation documents; acquisition documentation;
  acquisition contracts for the system, system component, or system services;
  system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with acquisition/contracting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for determining system security
  functional requirements; organizational processes for developing acquisition
  contracts; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing acquisitions and the
  inclusion of security and privacy requirements in contracts].
