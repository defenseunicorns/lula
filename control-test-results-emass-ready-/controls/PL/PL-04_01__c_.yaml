control-acronym: "[r5] PL-04(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Include in the rules of behavior, restrictions on:

  (a) Use of social media, social networking sites, and external
  sites/applications;

  (b) Posting organizational information on public websites; and

  (c) Use of organization-provided identifiers (e.g., email addresses) and
  authentication secrets (e.g., passwords) for creating accounts on external
  sites/applications.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Social media, social networking, and external site/application usage
  restrictions address rules of behavior related to the use of social media,
  social networking, and external sites when organizational personnel are using
  such sites for official duties or in the conduct of official business, when
  organizational information is involved in social media and social networking
  transactions, and when personnel access social media and networking sites from
  organizational systems. Organizations also address specific rules that prevent
  unauthorized entities from obtaining non-public organizational information
  from social media and networking sites either directly or through inference.
  Non-public information includes personally identifiable information and system
  account information. Related Control(s): AC-22, AU-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security and privacy planning policy; procedures
  addressing rules of behavior for system users; rules of behavior; training
  policy; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  establishing, reviewing, and updating rules of behavior; organizational
  personnel with responsibility for literacy training and awareness and
  role-based training; organizational personnel who are authorized users of the
  system and have signed rules of behavior; organizational personnel with
  information security and privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for establishing rules of
  behavior; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the establishment of rules
  of behavior].
