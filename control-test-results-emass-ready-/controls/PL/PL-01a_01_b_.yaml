control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop, document, and disseminate to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles]:

  1. [Selection (one or more): Organization-level; Mission/business
  process-level; System-level] planning policy that:
    (a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
    (b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and
  2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the planning policy and the
  associated planning controls;

  b. Designate an [Assignment: organization-defined official] to manage the
  development, documentation, and dissemination of the planning policy and
  procedures; and

  c. Review and update the current planning:

  1. Policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events]; and

  2. Procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and following
  [Assignment: organization-defined events].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Planning policy and procedures for the controls in the PL family implemented
  within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important
  factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures
  contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that
  security and privacy programs collaborate on their development. Security and
  privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are
  preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission level or
  system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of
  the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies
  that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be
  established for security and privacy programs, for mission/business processes,
  and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls
  are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the
  object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and
  privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may
  precipitate an update to planning policy and procedures include, but are not
  limited to, assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or
  changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies,
  standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an
  organizational policy or procedure. Related Control(s): PM-9, PS-8, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Planning policy and procedures; system security plan;
  privacy plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with planning
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities].
