  Description:

  a. Develop security and privacy architectures for the system that:

  1. Describe the requirements and approach to be taken for protecting the
  confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational information;

  2. Describe the requirements and approach to be taken for processing
  personally identifiable information to minimize privacy risk to individuals;

  3. Describe how the architectures are integrated into and support the
  enterprise architecture; and

  4. Describe any assumptions about, and dependencies on, external systems and
  services;

  b. Review and update the architectures [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency] to reflect changes in the enterprise architecture; and

  c. Reflect planned architecture changes in security and privacy plans, Concept
  of Operations (CONOPS), criticality analysis, organizational procedures, and
  procurements and acquisitions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The security and privacy architectures at the system level are consistent with
  the organization-wide security and privacy architectures described in PM-7,
  which are integral to and developed as part of the enterprise architecture.
  The architectures include an architectural description, the allocation of
  security and privacy functionality (including controls), security- and
  privacy-related information for external interfaces, information being
  exchanged across the interfaces, and the protection mechanisms associated with
  each interface. The architectures can also include other information, such as
  user roles and the access privileges assigned to each role; security and
  privacy requirements; types of information processed, stored, and transmitted
  by the system; supply chain risk management requirements; restoration
  priorities of information and system services; and other protection needs.


  SP 800-160-1 provides guidance on the use of security architectures as part of
  the system development life cycle process. OMB M-19-03 requires the use of the
  systems security engineering concepts described in SP 800-160-1 for high value
  assets. Security and privacy architectures are reviewed and updated throughout
  the system development life cycle, from analysis of alternatives through
  review of the proposed architecture in the RFP responses to the design reviews
  before and during implementation (e.g., during preliminary design reviews and
  critical design reviews).


  In today’s modern computing architectures, it is becoming less common for
  organizations to control all information resources. There may be key
  dependencies on external information services and service providers.
  Describing such dependencies in the security and privacy architectures is
  necessary for developing a comprehensive mission and business protection
  strategy. Establishing, developing, documenting, and maintaining under
  configuration control a baseline configuration for organizational systems is
  critical to implementing and maintaining effective architectures. The
  development of the architectures is coordinated with the senior agency
  information security officer and the senior agency official for privacy to
  ensure that the controls needed to support security and privacy requirements
  are identified and effectively implemented. In many circumstances, there may
  be no distinction between the security and privacy architecture for a system.
  In other circumstances, security objectives may be adequately satisfied, but
  privacy objectives may only be partially satisfied by the security
  requirements. In these cases, consideration of the privacy requirements needed
  to achieve satisfaction will result in a distinct privacy architecture. The
  documentation, however, may simply reflect the combined architectures.


  PL-8 is primarily directed at organizations to ensure that architectures are
  developed for the system and, moreover, that the architectures are integrated
  with or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is
  primarily directed at the external information technology product and system
  developers and integrators. SA-17, which is complementary to PL-8, is selected
  when organizations outsource the development of systems or components to
  external entities and when there is a need to demonstrate consistency with the
  organization’s enterprise architecture and security and privacy architectures.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security and privacy planning policy; procedures
  addressing information security and privacy architecture development;
  procedures addressing information security and privacy architecture reviews
  and updates; enterprise architecture documentation; information security and
  privacy architecture documentation; system security plan; privacy plan;
  security and privacy CONOPS for the system; records of information security
  and privacy architecture reviews and updates; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security and privacy
  planning and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with information security and privacy architecture development
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for developing, reviewing, and
  updating the information security and privacy architecture; mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing the development, review, and update of the
  information security and privacy architecture].

  CCI-004299, CCI-004300. The resulting compliance status was set to

  resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because of the addition
  of a new security requirement to the assessment procedure that has not been
  previously assessed: CCI-004298, CCI-004299, CCI-004300.
