control-acronym: "[r5] PL-08(02)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Require that [Assignment: organization-defined controls] allocated to
  [Assignment: organization-defined locations and architectural layers] are
  obtained from different suppliers.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information technology products have different strengths and weaknesses.
  Providing a broad spectrum of products complements the individual offerings.
  For example, vendors offering malicious code protection typically update their
  products at different times, often developing solutions for known viruses,
  Trojans, or worms based on their priorities and development schedules. By
  deploying different products at different locations, there is an increased
  likelihood that at least one of the products will detect the malicious code.
  With respect to privacy, vendors may offer products that track personally
  identifiable information in systems. Products may use different tracking
  methods. Using multiple products may result in more assurance that personally
  identifiable information is inventoried. Related Control(s): SC-29, SR-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security and privacy planning policy; procedures
  addressing information security and privacy architecture development;
  enterprise architecture documentation; information security and privacy
  architecture documentation; system security plan; privacy plan; security and
  privacy CONOPS for the system; IT acquisitions policy; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security and privacy
  planning and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with information security and privacy architecture development
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with acquisition responsibilities;
  organizational personnel with information security and privacy
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for obtaining information
  security and privacy safeguards from different suppliers].
