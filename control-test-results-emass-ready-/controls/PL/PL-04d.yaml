control-acronym: "[r5] PL-04"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Establish and provide to individuals requiring access to the system, the
  rules that describe their responsibilities and expected behavior for
  information and system usage, security, and privacy;

  b. Receive a documented acknowledgment from such individuals, indicating that
  they have read, understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior,
  before authorizing access to information and the system;

  c. Review and update the rules of behavior [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency]; and

  d. Require individuals who have acknowledged a previous version of the rules
  of behavior to read and re-acknowledge [Selection (one or more): [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency]; when the rules are revised or updated].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Rules of behavior represent a type of access agreement for organizational
  users. Other types of access agreements include nondisclosure agreements,
  conflict-of-interest agreements, and acceptable use agreements (see PS-6).
  Organizations consider rules of behavior based on individual user roles and
  responsibilities and differentiate between rules that apply to privileged
  users and rules that apply to general users. Establishing rules of behavior
  for some types of non-organizational users, including individuals who receive
  information from federal systems, is often not feasible given the large number
  of such users and the limited nature of their interactions with the systems.
  Rules of behavior for organizational and non-organizational users can also be
  established in AC-8. The related controls section provides a list of controls
  that are relevant to organizational rules of behavior. PL-4b, the documented
  acknowledgment portion of the control, may be satisfied by the literacy
  training and awareness and role-based training programs conducted by
  organizations if such training includes rules of behavior. Documented
  acknowledgements for rules of behavior include electronic or physical
  signatures and electronic agreement check boxes or radio buttons. Related

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security and privacy planning policy; procedures
  addressing rules of behavior for system users; rules of behavior; signed
  acknowledgements; records for rules of behavior reviews and updates; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  establishing, reviewing, and updating rules of behavior; organizational
  personnel with responsibility for literacy training and awareness and
  role-based training; organizational personnel who are authorized users of the
  system and have signed and resigned rules of behavior; organizational
  personnel with information security and privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for establishing, reviewing,
  disseminating, and updating rules of behavior; mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing the establishment, review, dissemination, and update of rules of
  behavior].

cci-definition: "003070: Require individuals who have acknowledged a previous
  version of the rules of behavior to read and re-acknowledge, on an
  organization-defined frequency, and/or when the rules of behavior are revised
  or updated.; 004289: Defines the frequency individuals are required to read
  and re-acknowledge the rules of behavior whenever the rules are revised or
  updated."
implementation-guidance: CCI-004289 of this assessment procedure is
  automatically compliant because of coverage by DoD Enterprise.
assessment-procedures: "Determine if individuals who have acknowledged a
  previous version of the rules of behavior are required to read and
  reacknowledge [Selection (one or more): [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency]; when the rules are revised or updated]."

rev-4-migration-notes: "Automatically generated test result during Revision 5
  control set migration based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment
  procedures: PL-4.6; as well as the following Rev. 5 security requirements:
  CCI-004289. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant because
  the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test
  result/compliance statement: PL-4.6. The resulting compliance status was set
  to non-compliant because of the addition of a new security requirement to the
  assessment procedure that has not been previously assessed: CCI-004289."
