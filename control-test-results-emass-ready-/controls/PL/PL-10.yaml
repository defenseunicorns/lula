  Description:

  Select a control baseline for the system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Control baselines are predefined sets of controls specifically assembled to
  address the protection needs of a group, organization, or community of
  interest. Controls are chosen for baselines to either satisfy mandates imposed
  by laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and
  guidelines or address threats common to all users of the baseline under the
  assumptions specific to the baseline. Baselines represent a starting point for
  the protection of individuals’ privacy, information, and information systems
  with subsequent tailoring actions to manage risk in accordance with mission,
  business, or other constraints (see PL-11). Federal control baselines are
  provided in SP 800-53B. The selection of a control baseline is determined by
  the needs of stakeholders. Stakeholder needs consider mission and business
  requirements as well as mandates imposed by applicable laws, executive orders,
  directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. For example, the
  control baselines in SP 800-53B are based on the requirements from FISMA and
  PRIVACT. The requirements, along with the NIST standards and guidelines
  implementing the legislation, direct organizations to select one of the
  control baselines after the reviewing the information types and the
  information that is processed, stored, and transmitted on the system;
  analyzing the potential adverse impact of the loss or compromise of the
  information or system on the organization’s operations and assets,
  individuals, other organizations, or the Nation; and considering the results
  from system and organizational risk assessments. CNSSI 1253 provides guidance
  on control baselines for national security systems. Related Control(s): PL-2,
  PL-11, RA-2, RA-3, SA-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security and privacy planning policy; procedures
  addressing system security and privacy plan development and implementation;
  procedures addressing system security and privacy plan reviews and updates;
  system design documentation; system architecture and configuration
  documentation; system categorization decision; information types stored,
  transmitted, and processed by the system; system element/component
  information; stakeholder needs analysis; list of security and privacy
  requirements allocated to the system, system elements, and environment of
  operation; list of contractual requirements allocated to external providers of
  the system or system element; business impact analysis or criticality
  analysis; risk assessments; risk management strategy; organizational security
  and privacy policy; federal or organization-approved or mandated baselines or
  overlays; system security plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security and privacy
  planning and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with information security and privacy responsibilities; organizational
  personnel with responsibility for organizational risk management activities].
