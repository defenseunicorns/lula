control-acronym: "[r5] PL-07"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  a. Develop a Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for the system describing how the
  organization intends to operate the system from the perspective of information
  security and privacy; and

  b. Review and update the CONOPS [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The CONOPS may be included in the security or privacy plans for the system or
  in other system development life cycle documents. The CONOPS is a living
  document that requires updating throughout the system development life cycle.
  For example, during system design reviews, the concept of operations is
  checked to ensure that it remains consistent with the design for controls, the
  system architecture, and the operational procedures. Changes to the CONOPS are
  reflected in ongoing updates to the security and privacy plans, security and
  privacy architectures, and other organizational documents, such as procurement
  specifications, system development life cycle documents, and systems
  engineering documents. Related Control(s): PL-2, SA-2, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security and privacy planning policy; procedures
  addressing security and privacy CONOPS development; procedures addressing
  security and privacy CONOPS reviews and updates; security and privacy CONOPS
  for the system; system security plan; privacy plan; records of security and
  privacy CONOPS reviews and updates; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security and privacy
  planning and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with information security and privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for developing, reviewing, and
  updating the security CONOPS; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the
  development, review, and update of the security CONOPS].
