control-acronym: "[r5] PL-08(01)"
control-information: >-
  Description:

  Design the security and privacy architectures for the system using a
  defense-in-depth approach that:

  (a) Allocates [Assignment: organization-defined controls] to [Assignment:
  organization-defined locations and architectural layers]; and

  (b) Ensures that the allocated controls operate in a coordinated and mutually
  reinforcing manner.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations strategically allocate security and privacy controls in the
  security and privacy architectures so that adversaries must overcome multiple
  controls to achieve their objective. Requiring adversaries to defeat multiple
  controls makes it more difficult to attack information resources by increasing
  the work factor of the adversary; it also increases the likelihood of
  detection. The coordination of allocated controls is essential to ensure that
  an attack that involves one control does not create adverse, unintended
  consequences by interfering with other controls. Unintended consequences can
  include system lockout and cascading alarms. The placement of controls in
  systems and organizations is an important activity that requires thoughtful
  analysis. The value of organizational assets is an important consideration in
  providing additional layering. Defense-in-depth architectural approaches
  include modularity and layering (see SA-8(3)), separation of system and user
  functionality (see SC-2), and security function isolation (see SC-3). Related
  Control(s): SC-2, SC-3, SC-29, SC-36.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security and privacy planning policy; procedures
  addressing information security and privacy architecture development;
  enterprise architecture documentation; information security and privacy
  architecture documentation; system security plan; privacy plan; security and
  privacy CONOPS for the system; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security and privacy
  planning and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with information security and privacy architecture development
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for designing the information
  security and privacy architecture; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  the design of the information security and privacy architecture].

  Determine if:

  - the security architecture for the system is designed using a
  defense-in-depth approach that ensures the allocated controls operate in a
  coordinated and mutually reinforcing manner.

  - the privacy architecture for the system is designed using a defense-in-depth
  approach that ensures the allocated controls operate in a coordinated and
  mutually reinforcing manner.
