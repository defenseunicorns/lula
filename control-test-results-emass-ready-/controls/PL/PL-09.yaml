  Description:

  Centrally manage [Assignment: organization-defined controls and related
  processes].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Central management refers to organization-wide management and implementation
  of selected controls and processes. This includes planning, implementing,
  assessing, authorizing, and monitoring the organization-defined, centrally
  managed controls and processes. As the central management of controls is
  generally associated with the concept of common (inherited) controls, such
  management promotes and facilitates standardization of control implementations
  and management and the judicious use of organizational resources. Centrally
  managed controls and processes may also meet independence requirements for
  assessments in support of initial and ongoing authorizations to operate and as
  part of organizational continuous monitoring.


  Automated tools (e.g., security information and event management tools or
  enterprise security monitoring and management tools) can improve the accuracy,
  consistency, and availability of information associated with centrally managed
  controls and processes. Automation can also provide data aggregation and data
  correlation capabilities; alerting mechanisms; and dashboards to support
  risk-based decision-making within the organization.


  As part of the control selection processes, organizations determine the
  controls that may be suitable for central management based on resources and
  capabilities. It is not always possible to centrally manage every aspect of a
  control. In such cases, the control can be treated as a hybrid control with
  the control managed and implemented centrally or at the system level. The
  controls and control enhancements that are candidates for full or partial
  central management include but are not limited to: AC-2(1), AC-2(2), AC-2(3),
  AC-2(4), AC-4(all), AC-17(1), AC-17(2), AC-17(3), AC-17(9), AC-18(1),
  AC-18(3), AC-18(4), AC-18(5), AC-19(4), AC-22, AC-23, AT-2(1), AT-2(2),

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security and privacy planning policy; procedures
  addressing security and privacy plan development and implementation; system
  security plan; privacy plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security and privacy
  planning and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with responsibilities for planning/implementing central management of controls
  and related processes; organizational personnel with information security and
  privacy responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for the central management of
  controls and related processes; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  central management of controls and related processes].

  Automatically generated test result during Revision 5 control set migration
  based on the following mapped Rev. 4 assessment procedures: SI-2(1).1,
  SI-3(1).1, SI-8(1).1. The resulting compliance status was set to non-compliant
  because the following Rev. 4 assessment procedure had no locally entered test
  result/compliance statement: SI-2(1).1, SI-8(1).1.


  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (This must be done at the
  organizational level as there might be configuration management outside the
  scope of UDS.)

  This control has been inherited and will receive test results from the
  providing system or Common Control Package.

  Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Spam protection – relates to
  filtering spam in email or inputs. UDS doesn’t have an email system or
  user-generated content filtering; that’s outside scope. If an app on UDS was
  an email server, that app would need spam filtering, but the platform itself
  is neutral here.)
