control-information: >-
  Description:

  Tailor the selected control baseline by applying specified tailoring actions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The concept of tailoring allows organizations to specialize or customize a set
  of baseline controls by applying a defined set of tailoring actions. Tailoring
  actions facilitate such specialization and customization by allowing
  organizations to develop security and privacy plans that reflect their
  specific mission and business functions, the environments where their systems
  operate, the threats and vulnerabilities that can affect their systems, and
  any other conditions or situations that can impact their mission or business
  success. Tailoring guidance is provided in SP 800-53B. Tailoring a control
  baseline is accomplished by identifying and designating common controls,
  applying scoping considerations, selecting compensating controls, assigning
  values to control parameters, supplementing the control baseline with
  additional controls as needed, and providing information for control
  implementation. The general tailoring actions in SP 800-53B can be
  supplemented with additional actions based on the needs of organizations.
  Tailoring actions can be applied to the baselines in SP 800-53B in accordance
  with the security and privacy requirements from FISMA, PRIVACT, and OMB A-130.
  Alternatively, other communities of interest adopting different control
  baselines can apply the tailoring actions in SP 800-53B to specialize or
  customize the controls that represent the specific needs and concerns of those
  entities. Related Control(s): PL-10, RA-2, RA-3, RA-9, SA-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security and privacy planning policy; procedures
  addressing system security and privacy plan development and implementation;
  system design documentation; system categorization decision; information types
  stored, transmitted, and processed by the system; system element/component
  information; stakeholder needs analysis; list of security and privacy
  requirements allocated to the system, system elements, and environment of
  operation; list of contractual requirements allocated to external providers of
  the system or system element; business impact analysis or criticality
  analysis; risk assessments; risk management strategy; organizational security
  and privacy policy; federal or organization-approved or mandated baselines or
  overlays; baseline tailoring rationale; system security plan; privacy plan;
  records of system security and privacy plan reviews and updates; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security and privacy
  planning and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with information security and privacy responsibilities].
