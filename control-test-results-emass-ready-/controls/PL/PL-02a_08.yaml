  representative prior to plan implementation.

  b. Distribute copies of the plans and communicate subsequent changes to the
  plans to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles];

  d. Update the plans to address changes to the system and environment of
  operation or problems identified during plan implementation or control
  assessments; and

  e. Protect the plans from unauthorized d


  Supplemental Guidance:

  System security and privacy plans are scoped to the system and system
  components within the defined authorization boundary and contain an overview
  of the security and privacy requirements for the system and the controls
  selected to satisfy the requirements. The plans describe the intended
  application of each selected control in the context of the system with a
  sufficient level of detail to correctly implement the control and to
  subsequently assess the effectiveness of the control. The control
  documentation describes how system-specific and hybrid controls are
  implemented and the plans and expectations regarding the functionality of the
  system. System security and privacy plans can also be used in the design and
  development of systems in support of life cycle-based security and privacy
  engineering processes. System security and privacy plans are living documents
  that are updated and adapted throughout the system development life cycle
  (e.g., during capability determination, analysis of alternatives, requests for
  proposal, and design reviews). Section 2.1 describes the different types of
  requirements that are relevant to organizations during the system development
  life cycle and the relationship between requirements and controls.


  Organizations may develop a single, integrated security and privacy plan or
  maintain separate plans. Security and privacy plans relate security and
  privacy requirements to a set of controls and control enhancements. The plans
  describe how the controls and control enhancements meet the security and
  privacy requirements but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of
  the design or implementation of the controls and control enhancements.
  Security and privacy plans contain sufficient information (including
  specifications of control parameter values for selection and assignment
  operations explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation
  that is unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent
  determinations of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals,
  other organizations, and the Nation if the plan is implemented.


  Security and privacy plans need not be single documents. The plans can be a
  collection of various documents, including documents that already exist.
  Effective security and privacy plans make extensive use of references to
  policies, procedures, and additional documents, including design and
  implementation specifications where more detailed information can be obtained.
  The use of references helps reduce the documentation associated with security
  and privacy programs and maintains the security- and privacy-related
  information in other established management and operational areas, including
  enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems engineering,
  and acquisition. Security and privacy plans need not contain detailed
  contingency plan or incident response plan information but can instead
  provide—explicitly or by reference—sufficient information to define what needs
  to be accomplished by those plans.


  Security- and privacy-related activities that may require coordination and
  planning with other individuals or groups within the organization include
  assessments, audits, inspections, hardware and software maintenance,
  acquisition and supply chain risk management, patch management, and
  contingency plan testing. Planning and coordination include emergency and
  nonemergency (i.e., planned or non-urgent unplanned) situations. The process
  defined by organizations to plan and coordinate security- and privacy-related
  activities can also be included in other documents, as appropriate. Related

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.


  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security and privacy planning policy; procedures
  addressing system security and privacy plan development and implementation;
  procedures addressing security and privacy plan reviews and updates;
  enterprise architecture documentation; system security plan; privacy plan;
  records of system security and privacy plan reviews and updates; security and
  privacy architecture and design documentation; risk assessments; risk
  assessment results; control assessment documentation; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system security and
  privacy planning and plan implementation responsibilities; system developers;
  organizational personnel with information security and privacy
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for system security and privacy
  plan development, review, update, and approval; mechanisms supporting the
  system security and privacy plan].
