control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization includes in the rules of behavior, explicit restrictions on
  the use of social media/networking sites and posting organizational
  information on public websites.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement addresses rules of behavior related to the use of
  social media/networking sites: (i) when organizational personnel are using
  such sites for official duties or in the conduct of official business; (ii)
  when organizational information is involved in social media/networking
  transactions; and (iii) when personnel are accessing social media/networking
  sites from organizational information systems. Organizations also address
  specific rules that prevent unauthorized entities from obtaining and/or
  inferring non-public organizational information (e.g., system account
  information, personally identifiable information) from social media/networking
  sites.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security planning policy; procedures addressing rules
  of behavior for information system users; rules of behavior; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  establishing, reviewing, and updating rules of behavior; organizational
  personnel who are authorized users of the information system and have signed
  rules of behavior; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for establishing rules of
  behavior; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the
  establishment of rules of behavior].
