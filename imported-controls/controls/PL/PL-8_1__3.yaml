control-acronym: PL-8(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization designs its security architecture using a defense-in-depth
  approach that:

  (a) Allocates [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to
  [Assignment: organization-defined locations and architectural layers]; and

  (b) Ensures that the allocated security safeguards operate in a coordinated
  and mutually reinforcing manner.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations strategically allocate security safeguards (procedural,
  technical, or both) in the security architecture so that adversaries have to
  overcome multiple safeguards to achieve their objective. Requiring adversaries
  to defeat multiple mechanisms makes it more difficult to successfully attack
  critical information resources (i.e., increases adversary work factor) and
  also increases the likelihood of detection. The coordination of allocated
  safeguards is essential to ensure that an attack that involves one safeguard
  does not create adverse unintended consequences (e.g., lockout, cascading
  alarms) by interfering with another safeguard. Placement of security
  safeguards is a key activity. Greater asset criticality or information value
  merits additional layering. Thus, an organization may choose to place
  anti-virus software at organizational boundary layers, email/web servers,
  notebook computers, and workstations to maximize the number of related
  safeguards adversaries must penetrate before compromising the information and
  information systems. Related controls: SC-29, SC-36.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security planning policy; procedures addressing
  information security architecture development; enterprise architecture
  documentation; information security architecture documentation; security plan
  for the information system; security CONOPS for the information system; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security planning and
  plan implementation responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security architecture development responsibilities; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for designing the information
  security architecture; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the
  design of the information security architecture].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the security
  safeguards to be allocated to organization-defined locations. DoD has
  determined the security safeguards are not appropriate to define at the
  Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and current documentation of security safeguards to be allocated to
  organization-defined locations.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented security safeguards to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed defines the security safeguards to be
  allocated to organization-defined locations. DoD has determined the security
  safeguards are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
