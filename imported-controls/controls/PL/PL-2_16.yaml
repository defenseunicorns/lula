control-acronym: PL-2
control-information: "Description:

  The organization:

  a. Develops a security plan for the information system that:

  1. Is consistent with the organizationâs enterprise architecture;

  2. Explicitly defines the authorization boundary for the system;

  3. Describes the operational context of the information system in terms of
  missions and business processes;

  4. Provides the security categorization of the information system including
  supporting rationale;

  5. Describes the operational environment for the information system and
  relationships with or connections to other information systems;

  6. Provides an overview of the security requirements for the system;

  7. Identifies any relevant overlays, if applicable;

  8. Describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those
  requirements including a rationale for the tailoring within the control text
  decisions; and\

  9. Is reviewed and approved by the authorizing official or designated
  representative prior to plan implementation;

  b. Distributes copies of the security plan and communicates subsequent changes
  to the plan to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles];

  c. Reviews the security plan for the information system [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency];

  d. Updates the plan to address changes to the information system/environment
  of operation or problems identified during plan implementation or security
  control assessments; and

  e. Protects the security plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Security plans relate security requirements to a set of security controls and
  control enhancements. Security plans also describe, at a high level, how the
  security controls and control enhancements meet those security requirements,
  but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of the specific design or
  implementation of the controls/enhancements. Security plans contain sufficient
  information (including the specification of parameter values for assignment
  and selection statements either explicitly or by reference) to enable a design
  and implementation that is unambiguously compliant with the intent of the
  plans and subsequent determinations of risk to organizational operations and
  assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan is
  implemented as intended. Organizations can also apply tailoring guidance to
  the security control baselines in Appendix D and CNSS Instruction 1253 to
  develop overlays for community-wide use or to address specialized
  requirements, technologies, or missions/environments of operation (e.g.,
  DoD-tactical, Federal Public Key Infrastructure, or Federal Identity,
  Credential, and Access Management, space operations). Appendix I provides
  guidance on developing overlays.

  Security plans need not be single documents; the plans can be a collection of
  various documents including documents that already exist. Effective security
  plans make extensive use of references to policies, procedures, and additional
  documents (e.g., design and implementation specifications) where more detailed
  information can be obtained. This reduces the documentation requirements
  associated with security programs and maintains security-related information
  in other established management/operational areas related to enterprise
  architecture, system development life cycle, systems engineering, and
  acquisition. For example, security plans do not contain detailed contingency
  plan or incident response plan information but instead provide explicitly or
  by reference, sufficient information to define what needs to be accomplished
  by those plans. Related controls: AC-2, AC-6, AC-14, AC-17, AC-20, CA-2, CA-3,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security planning policy; procedures addressing
  security plan development and implementation; procedures addressing security
  plan reviews and updates; enterprise architecture documentation; security plan
  for the information system; records of security plan reviews and updates;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security planning and
  plan implementation responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for security plan
  development/review/update/approval; automated mechanisms supporting the
  information system security plan]."

  information system in accordance with organization-defined frequency.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The information system owner as part of the annual security control review
  will also review the security plan annually. Documentation of security plan
  reviews is required as an audit trail. DoD has defined the frequency as
  annually.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP) update records.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the audit records of security plan reviews to verify the
  security plan has been reviewed annually. DoD has defined the frequency as
  annually.
