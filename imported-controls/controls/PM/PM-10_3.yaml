control-acronym: PM-10
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Manages (i.e., documents, tracks, and reports) the security state of
  organizational information systems and the environments in which those systems
  operate through security authorization processes;

  b. Designates individuals to fulfill specific roles and responsibilities
  within the organizational risk management process; and

  c. Fully integrates the security authorization processes into an
  organization-wide risk management program.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Security authorization processes for information systems and environments of
  operation require the implementation of an organization-wide risk management
  process, a Risk Management Framework, and associated security standards and
  guidelines. Specific roles within the risk management process include an
  organizational risk executive (function) and designated authorizing officials
  for each organizational information system and common control provider.
  Security authorization processes are integrated with organizational continuous
  monitoring processes to facilitate ongoing understanding and acceptance of
  risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
  organizations, and the Nation. Related control: CA-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; procedures
  addressing management (i.e., documentation, tracking, and reporting) of the
  security authorization process; security authorization documents; lists or
  other documentation about security authorization process roles and
  responsibilities; risk assessment results relevant to the security
  authorization process and the organization-wide risk management program;
  organizational risk management strategy; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  program planning and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational
  personnel responsible for management of the security authorization process;
  authorizing officials; system owners, senior information security officer;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for security authorization;
  automated mechanisms supporting the security authorization process].
