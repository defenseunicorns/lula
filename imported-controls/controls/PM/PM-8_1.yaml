control-acronym: PM-8
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization addresses information security issues in the development,
  documentation, and updating of a critical infrastructure and key resources
  protection plan.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Protection strategies are based on the prioritization of critical assets and
  resources. The requirement and guidance for defining critical infrastructure
  and key resources and for preparing an associated critical infrastructure
  protection plan are found in applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,
  directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. Related controls:
  PM-1, PM-9, PM-11, RA-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; critical
  infrastructure and key resources protection plan; procedures addressing
  development, documentation, and updating of the critical infrastructure and
  key resources protection plan; HSPD 7; National Infrastructure Protection
  Plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  program planning and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational
  personnel responsible for developing, documenting, and updating the critical
  infrastructure and key resources protection plan; organizational personnel
  with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for developing, documenting, and
  updating the critical infrastructure and key resources protection plan;
  automated mechanisms supporting the development, documentation, and updating
  of the critical infrastructure and key resources protection plan].
