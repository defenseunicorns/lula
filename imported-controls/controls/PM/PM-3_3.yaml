control-acronym: PM-3
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Ensures that all capital planning and investment requests include the
  resources needed to implement the information security program and documents
  all exceptions to this requirement;

  b. Employs a business case/Exhibit 300/Exhibit 53 to record the resources
  required; and

  c. Ensures that information security resources are available for expenditure
  as planned.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations consider establishing champions for information security efforts
  and as part of including the necessary resources, assign specialized expertise
  and resources as needed. Organizations may designate and empower an Investment
  Review Board (or similar group) to manage and provide oversight for the
  information security-related aspects of the capital planning and investment
  control process. Related controls: PM-4, SA-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; Exhibits 300;
  Exhibits 53; business cases for capital planning and investment; procedures
  for capital planning and investment; documentation of exceptions to capital
  planning requirements; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  program planning responsibilities; organizational personnel responsible for
  capital planning and investment; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for capital planning and
  investment; organizational processes for business case/Exhibit 300/Exhibit 53
  development; automated mechanisms supporting the capital planning and
  investment process].

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The Program Management
  (PM) family of controls primarily focuses on high-level organizational
  security governance, including policies, risk management strategies, and
  enterprise-wide planning. These controls are typically addressed at the
  organizational level rather than by a specific technology platform like UDS.)
