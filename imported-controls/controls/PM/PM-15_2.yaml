control-acronym: PM-15
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization establishes and institutionalizes contact with selected
  groups and associations within the security community:

  a. To facilitate ongoing security education and training for organizational
  personnel;

  b. To maintain currency with recommended security practices, techniques, and
  technologies; and

  c. To share current security-related information including threats,
  vulnerabilities, and incidents.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Ongoing contact with security groups and associations is of paramount
  importance in an environment of rapidly changing technologies and threats.
  Security groups and associations include, for example, special interest
  groups, forums, professional associations, news groups, and/or peer groups of
  security professionals in similar organizations. Organizations select groups
  and associations based on organizational missions/business functions.
  Organizations share threat, vulnerability, and incident information consistent
  with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
  regulations, standards, and guidance. Related control: SI-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; risk management
  strategy; procedures for contacts with security groups and associations;
  evidence of established and institutionalized contact with security groups and
  associations; lists or other documentation about contact with and/or
  membership in security groups and associations; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  program planning and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational
  personnel responsible for establishing and institutionalizing contact with
  security groups and associations; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; personnel from selected groups and associations
  with which the organization has established and institutionalized contact].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for establishing and
  institutionalizing contact with security groups and associations; automated
  mechanisms supporting contacts with security groups and associations].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed establishes and institutionalizes
  contact with selected groups and associations within the security community to
  maintain currency with recommended security practices, techniques, and
  technologies.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation that establishes and institutionalizes
  contact with selected groups and associations within the security community to
  maintain currency with recommended security practices, techniques, and
  technologies.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines artifacts showing contact to ensure the organization
  being inspected/assessed establishes and institutionalizes contact with
  selected groups and associations within the security community to maintain
  currency with recommended security practices, techniques, and technologies.
