control-acronym: PM-4
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Implements a process for ensuring that plans of action and milestones for
  the security program and associated organizational information systems:

  1. Are developed and maintained;

  2. Document the remedial information security actions to adequately respond to
  risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
  organizations, and the Nation; and

  3. Are reported in accordance with OMB FISMA reporting requirements.

  b. Reviews plans of action and milestones for consistency with the
  organizational risk management strategy and organization-wide priorities for
  risk response actions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The plan of action and milestones is a key document in the information
  security program and is subject to federal reporting requirements established
  by OMB. With the increasing emphasis on organization-wide risk management
  across all three tiers in the risk management hierarchy (i.e., organization,
  mission/business process, and information system), organizations view plans of
  action and milestones from an organizational perspective, prioritizing risk
  response actions and ensuring consistency with the goals and objectives of the
  organization. Plan of action and milestones updates are based on findings from
  security control assessments and continuous monitoring activities. OMB FISMA
  reporting guidance contains instructions regarding organizational plans of
  action and milestones. Related control: CA-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; plans of action and
  milestones; procedures addressing plans of action and milestones development
  and maintenance; procedures addressing plans of action and milestones
  reporting; procedures for review of plans of action and milestones for
  consistency with risk management strategy and risk response priorities;
  results of risk assessments associated with plans of action and milestones;
  OMB FISMA reporting requirements; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  developing, maintaining, reviewing, and reporting plans of action and
  milestones; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for plan of action and milestones
  development, review, maintenance, reporting; automated mechanisms supporting
  plans of action and milestones].
