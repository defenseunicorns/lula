  Description:

  The organization establishes an information security workforce development and
  improvement program.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information security workforce development and improvement programs include,
  for example: (i) defining the knowledge and skill levels needed to perform
  information security duties and tasks; (ii) developing role-based training
  programs for individuals assigned information security roles and
  responsibilities; and (iii) providing standards for measuring and building
  individual qualifications for incumbents and applicants for information
  security-related positions. Such workforce programs can also include
  associated information security career paths to encourage: (i) information
  security professionals to advance in the field and fill positions with greater
  responsibility; and (ii) organizations to fill information security-related
  positions with qualified personnel. Information security workforce development
  and improvement programs are complementary to organizational security
  awareness and training programs. Information security workforce development
  and improvement programs focus on developing and institutionalizing core
  information security capabilities of selected personnel needed to protect
  organizational operations, assets, and individuals. Related controls: AT-2,
  AT-3.
