control-acronym: MA-4(3)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization

  (a) Requires that nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic services be performed
  from an information system that implements a security capability comparable to
  the capability implemented on the system being serviced; or

  (b) Removes the component to be serviced from the information system and prior
  to nonlocal maintenance or diagnostic services, sanitizes the component (with
  regard to organizational information) before removal from organizational
  facilities, and after the service is performed, inspects and sanitizes the
  component (with regard to potentially malicious software) before reconnecting
  the component to the information system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Comparable security capability on information systems, diagnostic tools, and
  equipment providing maintenance services implies that the implemented security
  controls on those systems, tools, and equipment are at least as comprehensive
  as the controls on the information system being serviced. Related controls:
  MA-3, SA-12, SI-3, SI-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system maintenance policy; procedures
  addressing nonlocal information system maintenance; service provider contracts
  and/or service-level agreements; maintenance records; inspection records;
  audit records; equipment sanitization records; media sanitization records;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  maintenance responsibilities; information system maintenance provider;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  organizational personnel responsible for media sanitization; system/network
  administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for comparable security and
  sanitization for nonlocal maintenance; organizational processes for removal,
  sanitization, and inspection of components serviced via nonlocal maintenance;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing component sanitization and
  inspection].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed sanitizes and inspects serviced
  components prior to reusing them on any information system. Alternatively, the
  organization being inspected/assessed complies with MA-4 (3) CCI 882.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) policy that states before removal from the facility for maintenance
  services, and prior to reconnection, an information system component is
  inspected for, and sanitized of, potentially malicious software.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines maintenance procedures for all non-local maintenance and
  diagnostic services to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed
  sanitizes and inspects serviced components prior to reusing them on any
  information system. Alternatively, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment ensures the organization being inspected/assessed
  complies with MA-4 (3) CCI 882.
