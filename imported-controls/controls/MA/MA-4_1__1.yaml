  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Audits nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions [Assignment:
  organization-defined audit events]; and

  (b) Reviews the records of the maintenance and diagnostic sessions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related controls: AU-2, AU-6, AU-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system maintenance policy; procedures
  addressing nonlocal information system maintenance; list of audit events;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  maintenance records; diagnostic records; audit records; reviews of maintenance
  and diagnostic session records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  maintenance responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with audit and review
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for audit and review of nonlocal
  maintenance; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing audit and
  review of nonlocal maintenance].

cci-definition: "002884: The organization audits nonlocal maintenance and
  diagnostic sessions' organization-defined audit events."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  audit nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions' organization-defined audit
  events. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs,
  the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG
  guidance that pertains to CCI 2884.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation of the procedure for auditing remote maintenance and
  diagnostic sessions for organization-defined audit events that occur during
  the remote maintenance and diagnostic session
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to audit nonlocal
  maintenance and diagnostic sessions' organization-defined audit events. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 2884.
