  Description:

  The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect the
  integrity and confidentiality of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic
  communications.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related controls: SC-8, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system maintenance policy; procedures
  addressing non-local information system maintenance; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; cryptographic mechanisms protecting nonlocal maintenance
  activities; maintenance records; diagnostic records; audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  maintenance responsibilities; network engineers; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Cryptographic mechanisms protecting nonlocal maintenance
  and diagnostic communications].

cci-definition: '002890: The information system implements cryptographic
  mechanisms to protect the integrity of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic
  communications.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of nonlocal
  maintenance and diagnostic communications. For information system components
  that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed
  must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 2890.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Policy or procedure that requires remote maintenance sessions be encrypted
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to implement
  cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of nonlocal maintenance and
  diagnostic communications. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 2890.
