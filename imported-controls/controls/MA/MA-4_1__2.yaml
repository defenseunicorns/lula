  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Audits nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions [Assignment:
  organization-defined audit events]; and

  (b) Reviews the records of the maintenance and diagnostic sessions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related controls: AU-2, AU-6, AU-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system maintenance policy; procedures
  addressing nonlocal information system maintenance; list of audit events;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  maintenance records; diagnostic records; audit records; reviews of maintenance
  and diagnostic session records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  maintenance responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with audit and review
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for audit and review of nonlocal
  maintenance; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing audit and
  review of nonlocal maintenance].

cci-definition: '002885: The organization defines the nonlocal maintenance and
  diagnostic session audit events to audit.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the nonlocal
  maintenance and diagnostic session audit events to audit. DoD has determined
  the audit events are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation detailing what events to audit during remote maintenance and
  diagnostic sessions
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented audit events to ensure the organization
  being inspected/assessed defines the nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic
  session audit events to audit. DoD has determined the audit events are not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
