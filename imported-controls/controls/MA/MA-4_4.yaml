control-acronym: MA-4
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization

  a. Approves and monitors nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities;

  b. Allows the use of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic tools only as
  consistent with organizational policy and documented in the security plan for
  the information system;

  c. Employs strong authenticators in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance
  and diagnostic sessions;

  d. Maintains records for nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities; and

  e. Terminates session and network connections when nonlocal maintenance is
  completed.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted
  by individuals communicating through a network, either an external network
  (e.g., the Internet) or an internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic
  activities are those activities carried out by individuals physically present
  at the information system or information system component and not
  communicating across a network connection. Authentication techniques used in
  the establishment of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions reflect the
  network access requirements in IA-2. Typically, strong authentication requires
  authenticators that are resistant to replay attacks and employ multifactor
  authentication. Strong authenticators include, for example, PKI where
  certificates are stored on a token protected by a password, passphrase, or
  biometric. Enforcing requirements in MA-4 is accomplished in part by other
  controls. Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, AC-17, AU-2, AU-3, IA-2, IA-4,
  IA-5, IA-8, MA-2, MA-5, MP-6, PL-2, SC-7, SC-10, SC-17.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system maintenance policy; procedures
  addressing nonlocal information system maintenance; security plan; information
  system design documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; maintenance records; diagnostic records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  maintenance responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing nonlocal
  maintenance; automated mechanisms implementing, supporting, and/or managing
  nonlocal maintenance; automated mechanisms for strong authentication of
  nonlocal maintenance diagnostic sessions; automated mechanisms for terminating
  nonlocal maintenance sessions and network connections].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.

  establishment of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  employ strong authenticators in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance and
  diagnostic sessions. For information system components that have applicable
  STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the
  STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 877.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to employ strong
  authenticators in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic
  sessions. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the
  components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 877.
