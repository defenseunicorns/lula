control-acronym: MA-3
control-information: "Description:

  The organization approves, controls, and monitors information system
  maintenance tools.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control addresses security-related issues associated with maintenance
  tools used specifically for diagnostic and repair actions on organizational
  information systems. Maintenance tools can include hardware, software, and
  firmware items. Maintenance tools are potential vehicles for transporting
  malicious code, either intentionally or unintentionally, into a facility and
  subsequently into organizational information systems. Maintenance tools can
  include, for example, hardware/software diagnostic test equipment and
  hardware/software packet sniffers. This control does not cover
  hardware/software components that may support information system maintenance,
  yet are a part of the system, for example, the software implementing
  âping,â âls,â âipconfig,â or the hardware and software
  implementing the monitoring port of an Ethernet switch. Related controls:
  MA-2, MA-5, MP-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system maintenance policy; procedures
  addressing information system maintenance tools; information system
  maintenance tools and associated documentation; maintenance records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  maintenance responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for approving, controlling, and
  monitoring maintenance tools; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing approval, control, and/or monitoring of maintenance tools].


  Justification to Select:\


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP
  Moderate Baseline, Rev 4"

  The organization being inspected/assessed controls information system
  maintenance tools that are approved IAW MA-3, CCI 865.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System Security Plan (SSP), including a list of approved
  maintenance tools
