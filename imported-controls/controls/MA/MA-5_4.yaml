control-acronym: MA-5
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization

  a. Establishes a process for maintenance personnel authorization and maintains
  a list of authorized maintenance organizations or personnel;

  b. Ensures that non-escorted personnel performing maintenance on the
  information system have required access authorizations; and

  c. Designates organizational personnel with required access authorizations and
  technical competence to supervise the maintenance activities of personnel who
  do not possess the required access authorizations.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies to individuals performing hardware or software
  maintenance on organizational information systems, while PE-2 addresses
  physical access for individuals whose maintenance duties place them within the
  physical protection perimeter of the systems (e.g., custodial staff, physical
  plant maintenance personnel). Technical competence of supervising individuals
  relates to the maintenance performed on the information systems while having
  required access authorizations refers to maintenance on and near the systems.
  Individuals not previously identified as authorized maintenance personnel,
  such as information technology manufacturers, vendors, systems integrators,
  and consultants, may require privileged access to organizational information
  systems, for example, when required to conduct maintenance activities with
  little or no notice. Based on organizational assessments of risk,
  organizations may issue temporary credentials to these individuals. Temporary
  credentials may be for one-time use or for very limited time periods. Related
  controls: AC-2, IA-8, MP-2, PE-2, PE-3, PE-4, RA-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system maintenance policy; procedures
  addressing maintenance personnel; service provider contracts; service-level
  agreements; list of authorized personnel; maintenance records; access control
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  maintenance responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for authorizing and managing
  maintenance personnel; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  authorization of maintenance personnel].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP
  Moderate Baseline, Rev 4

cci-definition: '002895: The organization designates organizational personnel
  with required access authorizations and technical competence to supervise the
  maintenance activities of personnel who do not possess the required access
  authorizations.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents organizational
  personnel with required access authorizations and technical competence to
  supervise the maintenance activities of personnel who do not possess the
  required access authorizations.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation that designates personnel with required access
  authorizations and technical competence to supervise the maintenance
  activities of personnel who do not possess the required access authorizations.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines documented organizational personnel to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed designates organizational personnel with
  required access authorizations and technical competence to supervise the
  maintenance activities of personnel who do not possess the required access
  authorizations.
