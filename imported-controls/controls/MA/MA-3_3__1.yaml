control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization prevents the unauthorized removal of maintenance equipment
  containing organizational information by:

  (a) Verifying that there is no organizational information contained on the
  equipment;

  (b) Sanitizing or destroying the equipment;

  (c) Retaining the equipment within the facility; or

  (d) Obtaining an exemption from [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
  roles] explicitly authorizing removal of the equipment from the facility.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizational information includes all information specifically owned by
  organizations and information provided to organizations in which organizations
  serve as information stewards.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system maintenance policy; procedures
  addressing information system maintenance tools; information system
  maintenance tools and associated documentation; maintenance records; equipment
  sanitization records; media sanitization records; exemptions for equipment
  removal; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  maintenance responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel responsible for media
  sanitization].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational process for preventing unauthorized removal
  of information; automated mechanisms supporting media sanitization or
  destruction of equipment; automated mechanisms supporting verification of
  media sanitization].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP
  Moderate Baseline, Rev 4
control-implementation-status: Inherited
security-control-designation: Common
control-implementation-narrative: AWS is responsible for the prevention of
  unauthorized removal of maintenance equipment through the enforcement of the
  AWS Maintenance Policy, which prohibits maintenance equipment removal for
  offsite repairs. Additionally, AWS is responsible for media decommissioning in
  the manner described in MP-6....

  sanitizing or destroying the equipment; (c) retaining the equipment within the
  facility; or (d) obtaining an exemption from organization-defined personnel or

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to take one of the following actions before authorizing removal of information
  equipment from the facility:

  1. verify there is no organizational information contained on maintenance
  equipment;

  2. Sanitize or destroy the equipment;

  3. Retain the equipment within the facility; or

  4. Obtain an exemption from personnel or roles defined in MA-3 (3), CCI 2882
  explicitly authorizing removal of the equipment from the facility.

  The organization must maintain a record of maintenance equipment removal and
  actions taken.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Policy that states how unauthorized removal of maintenance equipment is
  prevented
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process and record of maintenance
  equipment removal to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed takes
  one of the four actions listed in the implementation guidance.
