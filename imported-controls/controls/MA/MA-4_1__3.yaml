  Related controls: AU-2, AU-6, AU-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system maintenance policy; procedures
  addressing nonlocal information system maintenance; list of audit events;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  maintenance records; diagnostic records; audit records; reviews of maintenance
  and diagnostic session records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  maintenance responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with audit and review
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for audit and review of nonlocal
  maintenance; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing audit and
  review of nonlocal maintenance].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to review the records of the nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions. The
  organization must maintain a record of reviews.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Policy that mandates the review of remote maintenance and digital sessions
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process as well as the record of reviews
  to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed reviews the records of the
  nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions.
