  Description:

  The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined security
  safeguards] to protect its memory from unauthorized code execution.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Some adversaries launch attacks with the intent of executing code in
  non-executable regions of memory or in memory locations that are prohibited.
  Security safeguards employed to protect memory include, for example, data
  execution prevention and address space layout randomization. Data execution
  prevention safeguards can either be hardware-enforced or software-enforced
  with hardware providing the greater strength of mechanism. Related controls:
  AC-25, SC-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing memory protection for the information system; information system
  design documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; list of security safeguards protecting information system
  memory from unauthorized code execution; information system audit records;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  memory protection; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  safeguards to protect information system memory from unauthorized code
  execution].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the security
  safeguards to be implemented to protect the information system's memory from
  unauthorized code execution. DoD has determined the security safeguards are
  not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System security plan defines security safeguards to
  protect information system against unauthorized code execution.

  2.) Protection software configuration is configured to block and report on
  unauthorized code execution attempts.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented security safeguards to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed defines the security safeguards to be
  implemented to protect the information system's memory from unauthorized code
  execution. DoD has determined the security safeguards are not appropriate to
  define at the Enterprise level.

test-results: 'UDS benefits from modern OS and container runtime protections.
  The underlying Linux kernel (especially if using a Defense Unicorn hardened
  distro) provides memory protection features (like NX bit to prevent code
  execution on the stack, ASLR for address randomization). Containers add
  another layer of isolation, so one containerâs memory is not accessible to
  another. Many UDS components are written in memory-safe languages (or managed
  environments). For instance, Grafana is in Go (with automatic memory
  management), which reduces certain memory corruption risks. While UDS
  doesnât provide a specific memory firewall, it inherits strong memory
  protection from the environment it runs in. Therefore, the system has
  effective memory protection in place by virtue of platform and language
  security features.'
