control-acronym: SI-4(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization connects and configures individual intrusion detection tools
  into an information system-wide intrusion detection system.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing information system monitoring tools and techniques; information
  system design documentation; information system monitoring tools and
  techniques documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility for monitoring the information
  system; organizational personnel with responsibility for the intrusion
  detection system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for intrusion
  detection/information system monitoring; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing intrusion detection capability].

cci-definition: '002655: Connects individual intrusion detection tools into an
  system-wide intrusion detection system.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed connects individual intrusion
  detection tools into an information system-wide intrusion detection system.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Logs from individual intrusion detection tools from information system
  wide intrusion detection system.

  2.) Architecture documentation of intrusion detection system and individual
  tools.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system-wide intrusion detection system architecture
  and individuals tools to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  connects individual intrusion detection tools into an information system-wide
  intrusion detection system.
