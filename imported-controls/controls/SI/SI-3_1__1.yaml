control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization centrally manages malicious code protection mechanisms.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Central management is the organization-wide management and implementation of
  malicious code protection mechanisms. Central management includes planning,
  implementing, assessing, authorizing, and monitoring the organization-defined,
  centrally managed flaw malicious code protection security controls. Related
  controls: AU-2, SI-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing malicious code protection; automated mechanisms supporting
  centralized management of malicious code protection mechanisms; information
  system design documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility for malicious code protection].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for central management of
  malicious code protection mechanisms; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing central management of malicious code protection mechanisms].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to centrally manage malicious code protection mechanisms.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan with section that confirms malicious
  code is being blocked and quarantined and a reference to the section
  pertaining to how process is centrally managed.

  2.) Complete protection software logs.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed centrally manages malicious code protection mechanisms.
