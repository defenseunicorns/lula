  Description:

  The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined additional
  monitoring] of privileged users.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing information system monitoring tools and techniques; information
  system design documentation; list of privileged users; information system
  monitoring tools and techniques documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; information system
  monitoring logs or records; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility for monitoring the information
  system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for information system
  monitoring; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing system
  monitoring capability].

cci: 2676
cci-definition: '002676: The organization defines additional monitoring to be
  implemented for privileged users.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents additional
  monitoring to be implemented for privileged users. DoD has determined the
  additional monitoring is not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System security plan defines additional monitoring to be
  implemented for privileged users.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented additional monitoring to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed defines additional monitoring to be
  implemented for privileged users. DoD has determined the additional monitoring
  is not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
