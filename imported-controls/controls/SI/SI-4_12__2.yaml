control-acronym: SI-4(12)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs automated mechanisms to alert security personnel of
  the following inappropriate or unusual activities with security implications:
  [Assignment: organization-defined activities that trigger alerts].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement focuses on the security alerts generated by
  organizations and transmitted using automated means. In contrast to the alerts
  generated by information systems in SI-4 (5), which tend to focus on
  information sources internal to the systems (e.g., audit records), the sources
  of information for this enhancement can include other entities as well (e.g.,
  suspicious activity reports, reports on potential insider threats). Related
  controls: AC-18, IA-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing information system monitoring tools and techniques; information
  system design documentation; information system monitoring tools and
  techniques documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; list of inappropriate or unusual activities (with
  security implications) that trigger alerts; alerts/notifications provided to
  security personnel; information system monitoring logs or records; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers;
  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the
  information system; organizational personnel with responsibility for
  monitoring the information system; organizational personnel with
  responsibility for the intrusion detection system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for intrusion
  detection/information system monitoring; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing intrusion detection/information system monitoring
  capability; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing automated
  alerts to security personnel].

cci-definition: '001275: The organization defines the activities which will
  trigger alerts to security personnel of inappropriate or unusual activities.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  DoD has defined the activities that trigger alerts as when there are threats
  identified by authoritative sources (e.g. CTOs) and IAW with CJCSM 6510.01B.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically compliant per CJCSM 6510.01B.
assessment-procedures: The organization being inspected/assessed is
  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the activities that trigger alerts as when there are
  threats identified by authoritative sources (e.g. CTOs) and IAW with CJCSM
  6510.01B.
