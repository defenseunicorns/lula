  Description:

  The organization removes [Assignment: organization-defined software and
  firmware components] after updated versions have been installed.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Previous versions of software and/or firmware components that are not removed
  from the information system after updates have been installed may be exploited
  by adversaries. Some information technology products may remove older versions
  of software and/or firmware automatically from the information system.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing flaw remediation; automated mechanisms supporting flaw remediation;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; records of software and firmware
  component removals after updated versions are installed; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility for flaw remediation].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  removal of previous versions of software/firmware].

  installed.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  remove all upgraded/replaced software components that are no longer required
  for operation (e.g., previous versions) after updated versions have been
  installed. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG
  guidance that pertains to CCI 2617. DoD has defined the software components as
  all upgraded/replaced software components that are no longer required for
  operation.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan.

  2.) Configuration documentation for the removal of all upgraded/replaced
  software components that are no longer required for operation (e.g., previous
  versions) after updated versions have been installed.

  3.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks pertaining to CCI 2617.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to remove all
  upgraded/replaced software components that are no longer required for
  operation (e.g., previous versions) after updated versions have been
  installed. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the
  components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 2617. DoD has defined the software components as all
  upgraded/replaced software components that are no longer required for
  operation.

test-results: UDS inherently manages the lifecycle of software components
  through its containerized and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployment model
  using OpenTofu and Zarf packages. When software updates or new versions of
  components are installed, Kubernetes automatically removes outdated container
  images and deployments, ensuring only the current, approved versions remain
  operational.
