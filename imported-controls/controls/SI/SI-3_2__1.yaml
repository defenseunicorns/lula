control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system automatically updates malicious code protection
  mechanisms.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Malicious code protection mechanisms include, for example, signature
  definitions. Due to information system integrity and availability concerns,
  organizations give careful consideration to the methodology used to carry out
  automatic updates. Related control: SI-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing malicious code protection; automated mechanisms supporting
  centralized management of malicious code protection mechanisms; information
  system design documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers;
  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the
  information system; organizational personnel with responsibility for malicious
  code protection].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  automatic updates to malicious code protection capability].

cci-definition: '001247: The information system automatically updates malicious
  code protection mechanisms.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  automatically update malicious code protection mechanisms. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  1247.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan.

  2.) Continuous monitoring plan.

  3.) Reference to system security plan and continuous monitoring plan sections
  pertaining to how information system obtains, verifies and applies updates to
  malicious code protection mechanisms.

  4.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks pertaining to CCI 1247.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to automatically update
  malicious code protection mechanisms. For information system components that
  have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 1247.
