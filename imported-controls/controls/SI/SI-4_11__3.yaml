control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization analyzes outbound communications traffic at the external
  boundary of the information system and selected [Assignment:
  organization-defined interior points within the system (e.g., subnetworks,
  subsystems)] to discover anomalies.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Anomalies within organizational information systems include, for example,
  large file transfers, long-time persistent connections, unusual protocols and
  ports in use, and attempted communications with suspected malicious external
  addresses.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing information system monitoring tools and techniques; information
  system design documentation; network diagram; information system monitoring
  tools and techniques documentation; information system configuration settings
  and associated documentation; information system monitoring logs or records;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility for monitoring the information
  system; organizational personnel with responsibility for the intrusion
  detection system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for intrusion
  detection/information system monitoring; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing intrusion detection/information system monitoring
  capability; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing analysis of
  communications traffic].

cci-definition: '002668: The organization defines the interior points within the
  information system (e.g., subnetworks, subsystems) where outbound
  communications will be analyzed to discover anomalies.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the interior
  points within the information system (e.g., subnetworks, subsystems) where
  outbound communications will be analyzed to discover anomalies. DoD has
  determined the interior points are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise
  level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan defines the interior points within
  the information system (e.g., subnetworks, subsystems) where outbound
  communications will be analyzed to discover anomalies.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented interior points to ensure the organization
  being inspected/assessed defines the interior points within the information
  system (e.g., subnetworks, subsystems) where outbound communications will be
  analyzed to discover anomalies. DoD has determined the interior points are not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
