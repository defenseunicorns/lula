control-acronym: SI-7(8)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system, upon detection of a potential integrity violation,
  provides the capability to audit the event and initiates the following
  actions: [Selection (one or more): generates an audit record; alerts current
  user; alerts [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles];
  [Assignment: organization-defined other actions]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations select response actions based on types of software, specific
  software, or information for which there are potential integrity violations.
  Related controls: AU-2, AU-6, AU-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing software, firmware, and information integrity; information system
  design documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; integrity verification tools and associated documentation;
  records of integrity scans; incident response records, list of
  security-relevant changes to the information system; automated tools
  supporting alerts and notifications if unauthorized security changes are
  detected; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  software, firmware, and/or information integrity; organizational personnel
  with information security responsibilities; system/network administrators;
  system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Software, firmware, and information integrity verification
  tools; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the capability to
  audit potential integrity violations; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing alerts about potential integrity violations].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  provide the capability to audit the event upon detection of a potential
  integrity violation. For information system components that have applicable
  STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the
  STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 2723.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Configuration documentation for the information system to provide the
  capability to audit the event upon detection of a potential integrity
  violation.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to provide the capability
  to audit the event upon detection of a potential integrity violation. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 2723.

test-results: 'In UDS, when a potential integrity violation is detected, the
  system automatically generates a detailed audit record capturing critical
  information such as timestamps, affected components, user or service
  identities, and the nature of the violation. This capability is provided by
  integrated logging tools like Loki and enforced through Pepr policies and
  NeuVectorâs monitoring, ensuring that all events are documented in a
  tamper-resistant manner for subsequent forensic analysis and incident
  response.'
