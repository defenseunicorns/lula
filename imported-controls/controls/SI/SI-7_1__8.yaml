control-acronym: SI-7(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system performs an integrity check of [Assignment:
  organization-defined software, firmware, and information] [Selection (one or
  more): at startup; at [Assignment: organization-defined transitional states or
  security-relevant events]; [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Security-relevant events include, for example, the identification of a new
  threat to which organizational information systems are susceptible, and the
  installation of new hardware, software, or firmware. Transitional states
  include, for example, system startup, restart, shutdown, and abort.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing software, firmware, and information integrity; information system
  design documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; integrity verification tools and associated documentation;
  records of integrity scans; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  software, firmware, and/or information integrity; organizational personnel
  with information security responsibilities; system/network administrators;
  system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Software, firmware, and information integrity verification
  tools].

  organization-defined information at startup, at organization-defined
  transitional states or security-relevant events, or on organization-defined
  frequency.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  perform an integrity check of information defined in SI-7 (1), CCI 2707 at
  startup, at transitional states or security-relevant events defined in SI-7
  (1), CCI 2708, or annually. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 2712. DoD has defined
  the frequency as annually.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System security plan lists the organization-defined
  frequency at which integrity verification is performed on software.

  2.) Trail of records (containing valid date/time stamps) to confirm frequency
  of integrity validation.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to perform an integrity
  check of information defined in SI-7 (1), CCI 2707 at startup, at transitional
  states or security-relevant events defined in SI-7 (1), CCI 2708, or annually.
  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 2712. DoD has defined the frequency as annually.

test-results: In UDS, integrity checks for organization-defined software are
  performed at multiple points throughout the system lifecycle. At startup, each
  container image or Zarf package is validated using cryptographic signatures
  and baseline comparisons via OpenTofu to ensure that only approved software is
  deployed. Transitional states such as during deployments, configuration
  changes, or security-relevant events trigger automated integrity checks
  through Pepr policies, which promptly revalidate the affected components and
  flag any deviations.
