control-acronym: SI-2(3)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Measures the time between flaw identification and flaw remediation; and

  (b) Establishes [Assignment: organization-defined benchmarks] for taking
  corrective actions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement requires organizations to determine the current time
  it takes on the average to correct information system flaws after such flaws
  have been identified, and subsequently establish organizational benchmarks
  (i.e., time frames) for taking corrective actions. Benchmarks can be
  established by type of flaw and/or severity of the potential vulnerability if
  the flaw can be exploited.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing flaw remediation; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation; list
  of benchmarks for taking corrective action on flaws identified; records
  providing time stamps of flaw identification and subsequent flaw remediation
  activities; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility for flaw remediation].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for identifying, reporting, and
  correcting information system flaws; automated mechanisms used to measure the
  time between flaw identification and flaw remediation].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed implements benchmarks for the time
  taken to apply corrective actions after flaw identification IAW the period
  directed by an authoritative source (e.g. IAVM, CTOs, DTMs, STIGs). DoD has
  defined the benchmarks as within the time period directed by an authoritative
  source (e.g. IAVM, CTOs, DTMs, STIGs).

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Implementation documentation of benchmarks for the time taken to apply
  corrective actions after flaw identification IAW the period directed by an
  authoritative source (e.g. IAVM, CTOs, DTMs, STIGs).
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines records of corrective actions taken to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed implements benchmarks for the time taken
  to apply corrective actions after flaw identification IAW the period directed
  by an authoritative source (e.g. IAVM, CTOs, DTMs, STIGs). DoD has defined the
  benchmarks as within the time period directed by an authoritative source (e.g.
  IAVM, CTOs, DTMs, STIGs).
