  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Identifies, reports, and corrects information system flaws;

  b. Tests software and firmware updates related to flaw remediation for
  effectiveness and potential side effects before installation;

  c. Installs security-relevant software and firmware updates within
  [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of the release of the updates;
  and

  d. Incorporates flaw remediation into the organizational configuration
  management process


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations identify information systems affected by announced software
  flaws including potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws, and
  report this information to designated organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities. Security-relevant software updates
  include, for example, patches, service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus
  signatures. Organizations also address flaws discovered during security
  assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system
  error handling. Organizations take advantage of available resources such as
  the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
  (CVE) databases in remediating flaws discovered in organizational information
  systems. By incorporating flaw remediation into ongoing configuration
  management processes, required/anticipated remediation actions can be tracked
  and verified. Flaw remediation actions that can be tracked and verified
  include, for example, determining whether organizations follow US-CERT
  guidance and Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts. Organization-defined
  time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary
  based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of
  the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the
  vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation
  may require more testing than other types. Organizations determine the degree
  and type of testing needed for the specific type of flaw remediation activity
  under consideration and also the types of changes that are to be
  configuration-managed. In some situations, organizations may determine that
  the testing of software and/or firmware updates is not necessary or practical,
  for example, when implementing simple anti-virus signature updates.
  Organizations may also consider in testing decisions, whether
  security-relevant software or firmware updates are obtained from authorized
  sources with appropriate digital signatures. Related controls: CA-2, CA-7,
  CM-3, CM-5, CM-8, MA-2, IR-4, RA-5, SA-10, SA-11, SI-11.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing flaw remediation; procedures addressing configuration management;
  list of flaws and vulnerabilities potentially affecting the information
  system; list of recent security flaw remediation actions performed on the
  information system (e.g., list of installed patches, service packs, hot fixes,
  and other software updates to correct information system flaws); test results
  from the installation of software and firmware updates to correct information
  system flaws; installation/change control records for security-relevant
  software and firmware updates; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility for flaw remediation;
  organizational personnel with configuration management responsibility].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for identifying, reporting, and
  correcting information system flaws; organizational process for installing
  software and firmware updates; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing reporting, and correcting information system flaws; automated
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing testing software and firmware
  updates].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed corrects information system flaws
  within the time period directed by an authoritative source (e.g. IAVM, CTOs,
  DTMs, STIGs). 


  The organization documents the corrections on their POA&M.


  DoD has defined the time period as within the time period directed by an
  authoritative source (e.g. IAVM, CTOs, DTMs, STIGs).


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System security plan (SSP) with a reference to the
  section that pertains to how system flaws are fixed or mitigated.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the information system POA&M and examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed corrects
  information system flaws.

compliance-status: Compliant
test-results: Flaw remediation is addressed by the fact that UDS identifies
  flaws (via RA-5 vulnerability scanning) and the architecture makes it easy to
  deploy patches (using updated images via Zarf). When a security patch is
  released for a component (say a new Keycloak version fixes a vulnerability),
  the organization can build a new UDS package with that updated component and
  deploy it relatively quickly.
