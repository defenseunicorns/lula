  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Monitors the information system to detect:

  1. Attacks and indicators of potential attacks in accordance with [Assignment:
  organization-defined monitoring objectives]; and

  2. Unauthorized local, network, and remote connections;

  b. Identifies unauthorized use of the information system through [Assignment:
  organization-defined techniques and methods];

  c. Deploys monitoring devices: (i) strategically within the information system
  to collect organization-determined essential information; and (ii) at ad hoc
  locations within the system to track specific types of transactions of
  interest to the organization;

  d. Protects information obtained from intrusion-monitoring tools from
  unauthorized access, modification, and deletion;

  e. Heightens the level of information system monitoring activity whenever
  there is an indication of increased risk to organizational operations and
  assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation based on law
  enforcement information, intelligence information, or other credible sources
  of information;

  f. Obtains legal opinion with regard to information system monitoring
  activities in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,
  directives, policies, or regulations; and

  g. Provides [Assignment: organization-defined information system monitoring
  information] to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]
  [Selection (one or more): as needed; [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information system monitoring includes external and internal monitoring.
  External monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the
  information system boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense and boundary
  protection). Internal monitoring includes the observation of events occurring
  within the information system. Organizations can monitor information systems,
  for example, by observing audit activities in real time or by observing other
  system aspects such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other
  actions. The monitoring objectives may guide determination of the events.
  Information system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of
  tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention
  systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record
  monitoring software, network monitoring software). Strategic locations for
  monitoring devices include, for example, selected perimeter locations and near
  server farms supporting critical applications, with such devices typically
  being employed at the managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7 and
  AC-17. Einstein network monitoring devices from the Department of Homeland
  Security can also be included as monitoring devices. The granularity of
  monitoring information collected is based on organizational monitoring
  objectives and the capability of information systems to support such
  objectives. Specific types of transactions of interest include, for example,
  Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP proxies.
  Information system monitoring is an integral part of organizational continuous
  monitoring and incident response programs. Output from system monitoring
  serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident response programs. A
  network connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a
  network (e.g., local area network, Internet). A remote connection is any
  connection with a device communicating through an external network (e.g., the
  Internet). Local, network, and remote connections can be either wired or
  wireless. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, AC-8, AC-17, AU-2, AU-6, AU-7, AU-9,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Continuous monitoring strategy; system and information
  integrity policy; procedures addressing information system monitoring tools
  and techniques; facility diagram/layout; information system design
  documentation; information system monitoring tools and techniques
  documentation; locations within information system where monitoring devices
  are deployed; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility monitoring the information
  system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for information system
  monitoring; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing information
  system monitoring capability].
