  Description:

  The information system checks the validity of [Assignment:
  organization-defined information inputs].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs (e.g.,
  character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values) verifies that
  inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Software
  applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured
  messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules
  or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data
  interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications
  use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly
  encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or
  special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control
  information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives
  the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret
  the data incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing to interpreters
  prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input
  validation helps to ensure accurate and correct inputs and prevent attacks
  such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; access control
  policy and procedures; separation of duties policy and procedures; procedures
  addressing information input validation; documentation for automated tools and
  applications to verify validity of information; list of information inputs
  requiring validity checks; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  information input validation; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  validity checks on information inputs].

  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents specific
  inputs which do not require validity checks. DoD has defined the information
  inputs as all inputs except those identified specifically by the organization.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System security plan defines the organization inputs.

  information inputs as all inputs except those identified specifically by the
  organization.

test-results: Keycloak performs input validation internally for authentication
  and authorization-related inputs, ensuring protection against common injection
  and malformed input attacks. It validates all authentication credentials,
  tokens, and form inputs (e.g., usernames, passwords, client IDs, OAuth
  parameters) received during user authentication or authorization flows.
  Keycloak specifically checks for format and structure validation. Ensures all
  input parameters conform to expected patterns (e.g., rejects malformed
  OAuth2/OIDC requests). Prevents injection attacks by enforcing strict parsing
  rules, escaping special characters, and rejecting inputs outside expected
  parameters. Cryptographically verifies the authenticity and integrity of JWT
  tokens, rejecting any tokens that fail verification. (UDS cannot universally
  enforce input validation for all applications; that is typically the
  responsibility of each application (e.g., a web app needs to validate user
  input to prevent SQL injection.)
