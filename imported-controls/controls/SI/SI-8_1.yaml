control-acronym: SI-8
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Employs spam protection mechanisms at information system entry and exit
  points to detect and take action on unsolicited messages; and

  b. Updates spam protection mechanisms when new releases are available in
  accordance with organizational configuration management policy and procedures.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information system entry and exit points include, for example, firewalls,
  electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, remote-access servers,
  workstations, mobile devices, and notebook/laptop computers. Spam can be
  transported by different means including, for example, electronic mail,
  electronic mail attachments, and web accesses. Spam protection mechanisms
  include, for example, signature definitions. Related controls: AT-2, AT-3,
  SC-5, SC-7, SI-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; configuration
  management policy and procedures (CM-1); procedures addressing spam
  protection; spam protection mechanisms; records of spam protection updates;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for spam
  protection; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for implementing spam protection;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing spam protection].

  messages.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed implements spam protection
  mechanisms at information system entry points to detect and take action on
  unsolicited messages.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System security plan documents what protection mechanisms
  are used to guard against spam at information system entry points.

  2.) Protection software logs.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the hardware/software list to ensure the organization
  being inspected/assessed implements spam protection mechanisms at information
  system entry points to detect and take action on unsolicited messages. The
  organization may be required to demonstrate the use of the identified spam
  protection mechanisms.

test-results: 'Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Spam protection â
  relates to filtering spam in email or inputs. UDS doesnât have an email
  system or user-generated content filtering; thatâs outside scope. If an app
  on UDS was an email server, that app would need spam filtering, but the
  platform itself is neutral here.)'
