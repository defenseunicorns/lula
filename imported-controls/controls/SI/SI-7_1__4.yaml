control-acronym: SI-7(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system performs an integrity check of [Assignment:
  organization-defined software, firmware, and information] [Selection (one or
  more): at startup; at [Assignment: organization-defined transitional states or
  security-relevant events]; [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Security-relevant events include, for example, the identification of a new
  threat to which organizational information systems are susceptible, and the
  installation of new hardware, software, or firmware. Transitional states
  include, for example, system startup, restart, shutdown, and abort.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing software, firmware, and information integrity; information system
  design documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; integrity verification tools and associated documentation;
  records of integrity scans; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  software, firmware, and/or information integrity; organizational personnel
  with information security responsibilities; system/network administrators;
  system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Software, firmware, and information integrity verification
  tools].

  security-relevant events when the information system will perform integrity
  checks on software, firmware and information.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the
  transitional state or security-relevant events when the information system
  will perform integrity checks on software, firmware and information. DoD has
  determined the transitional state or security-relevant events are not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System security plan defines the transitional state or
  security-relevant events when the information system will perform integrity
  checks on software, firmware and information.

  2.) Implementation documentation of integrity verification tool.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented transitional state or security-relevant
  event to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed defines the
  transitional state or security-relevant events when the information system
  will perform integrity checks on software, firmware and information. DoD has
  determined the transitional state or security-relevant events are not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

test-results: 'In UDS, integrity checks on software, firmware, and information
  are systematically performed during defined transitional states and in
  response to security-relevant events. For instance, integrity validations
  occur during deployment when new Zarf packages and container images are
  launched and when configuration changes are applied through Infrastructure as
  Code (OpenTofu). Pepr serves as a policy engine that can be configured to
  automatically trigger integrity verifications during key eventsâsuch as
  before and after deployment transitions, configuration changes, or when
  security-relevant incidents occur. For example, when a new Zarf package is
  staged for deployment or when unauthorized modifications are detected, Pepr
  can enforce pre-defined policies that prompt an immediate integrity check,
  comparing critical software, firmware, and configuration files against an
  approved baseline. This automated enforcement helps ensure that any deviations
  are promptly detected and remediated, thereby strengthening the overall
  security posture in accordance with organization-defined requirements.'
