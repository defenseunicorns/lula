control-acronym: SI-7(14)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Prohibits the use of binary or machine-executable code from sources with
  limited or no warranty and without the provision of source code; and

  (b) Provides exceptions to the source code requirement only for compelling
  mission/operational requirements and with the approval of the authorizing
  official.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement applies to all sources of binary or
  machine-executable code including, for example, commercial software/firmware
  and open source software. Organizations assess software products without
  accompanying source code from sources with limited or no warranty for
  potential security impacts. The assessments address the fact that these types
  of software products may be very difficult to review, repair, or extend, given
  that organizations, in most cases, do not have access to the original source
  code, and there may be no owners who could make such repairs on behalf of
  organizations. Related control: SA-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing software, firmware, and information integrity; information system
  design documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; approval records for execution of binary and machine-executable
  code; information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  software, firmware, and/or information integrity; organizational personnel
  with information security responsibilities; authorizing official;
  system/network administrators; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  prohibition of the execution of binary or machine-executable code].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and provides exceptions to
  the source code requirement only for compelling mission/operational
  requirements and with the approval of the authorizing official.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System security plan documents and provides expectations
  to he source code requirement only for compelling mission/operational
  requirements and with the approval of the authorizing official.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented exceptions to the source code requirement
  to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed provides justification and
  approval of the authorizing official for all exceptions to the source code
  requirement.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS inherently emphasizes
  open-source software, transparency, and traceability through Infrastructure as
  Code (IaC) and containerization strategies. It provides full visibility and
  access to source code and software components used within the system. The
  policy decision to provide exceptions for utilizing binary or executable code
  without accompanying source code and warranties is an organizational
  governance matter, managed through internal security policies, risk
  acceptance, and approval processes. As this control relates specifically to
  procedural policy decisions about software sourcing rather than technical
  implementation, it is considered outside the technical scope of UDS itself and
  therefore not applicable directly to the technology stack provided.)
