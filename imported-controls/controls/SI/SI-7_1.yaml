control-acronym: SI-7
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs integrity verification tools to detect unauthorized
  changes to [Assignment: organization-defined software, firmware, and
  information].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Unauthorized changes to software, firmware, and information can occur due to
  errors or malicious activity (e.g., tampering). Software includes, for
  example, operating systems (with key internal components such as kernels,
  drivers), middleware, and applications. Firmware includes, for example, the
  Basic Input Output System (BIOS). Information includes metadata such as
  security attributes associated with information. State-of-the-practice
  integrity-checking mechanisms (e.g., parity checks, cyclical redundancy
  checks, cryptographic hashes) and associated tools can automatically monitor
  the integrity of information systems and hosted applications. Related
  controls: SA-12, SC-8, SC-13, SI-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing software, firmware, and information integrity; information system
  design documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; integrity verification tools and associated documentation;
  records generated/triggered from integrity verification tools regarding
  unauthorized software, firmware, and information changes; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  software, firmware, and/or information integrity; organizational personnel
  with information security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Software, firmware, and information integrity verification
  tools].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] Privacy (Confidentiality Impact Level: Moderate) Overlay:
  Detection of unauthorized changes to PII and systems containing PII is
  fundamental to ensuring integrity as required by the Privacy Act.

cci-definition: '002703: The organization defines the software, firmware, and
  information which will be subjected to integrity verification tools to detect
  unauthorized changes.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the software,
  firmware, and information which will be subjected to integrity verification
  tools to detect unauthorized changes. DoD has determined the software,
  firmware, and information are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise
  level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System security plan defines the software, firmware and
  information which will be subjected to integrity verification tools to check
  for unauthorized changes.

  2.) Implementation documentation of integrity verification tools that will
  check for those unauthorized changes.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented software, firmware, and information to
  ensure the organization being inspected/assessed defines the software,
  firmware, and information which will be subjected to integrity verification
  tools to detect unauthorized changes. DoD has determined the software,
  firmware, and information are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise
  level.
