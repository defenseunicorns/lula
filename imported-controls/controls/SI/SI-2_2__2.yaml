  Description:

  The organization employs automated mechanisms [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] to determine the state of information system
  components with regard to flaw remediation.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related controls: CM-6, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing flaw remediation; automated mechanisms supporting centralized
  management of flaw remediation; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility for flaw remediation].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms used to determine the state of
  information system components with regard to flaw remediation].

  DoD has defined the frequency as continuously with HBSS; 30 days for any
  additional internal network scans not covered by HBSS; annually for external
  scans by (Computer Network Defense Service Provider) CNDSP.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically compliant.
assessment-procedures: The organization being inspected/assessed is
  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the frequency as continuously with HBSS; 30 days for
  any additional internal network scans not covered by HBSS; annually for
  external scans by (Computer Network Defense Service Provider) CNDSP.
