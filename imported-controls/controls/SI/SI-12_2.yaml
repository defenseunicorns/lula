control-acronym: SI-12
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization handles and retains information within the information system
  and information output from the system in accordance with applicable federal
  laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
  operational requirements.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information handling and retention requirements cover the full life cycle of
  information, in some cases extending beyond the disposal of information
  systems. The National Archives and Records Administration provides guidance on
  records retention. Related controls: AC-16, AU-5, AU-11, MP-2, MP-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; federal laws,
  Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
  operational requirements applicable to information handling and retention;
  media protection policy and procedures; procedures addressing information
  system output handling and retention; information retention records, other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  information handling and retention; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for information handling and
  retention; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing information
  handling and retention].

  information system and information output from the system in accordance with
  applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
  standards, and operational requirements.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed identifies and documents federal
  laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
  operational requirements which apply to the information within the information
  system. The organization documents and implements a process to retain
  information IAW those documented federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
  policies, regulations, standards, and operational requirements.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System security plan.

  2.) Documentation pertaining to list of applicable federal laws, Executive
  Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and operational
  requirements within the information system and documented processes.

  3.) Process documentation for handling information within the information
  system and information output from the system in accordance with applicable
  federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards,
  and operational requirements.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented list of applicable federal laws, Executive
  Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and operational
  requirements which apply to the information within the information system, as
  well as the documented process for information retention to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed retains information within the
  information system and information output from the system in accordance with
  applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
  standards, and operational requirements.

test-results: UDS handles and maintains information according to organizational
  requirements but is dependent on the data being supported. Typically UDS
  setups configure data and backups to be maintained for one year but can be
  configured for longer.
