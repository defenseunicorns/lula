control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system behaves in a predictable and documented manner that
  reflects organizational and system objectives when invalid inputs are
  received.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A common vulnerability in organizational information systems is unpredictable
  behavior when invalid inputs are received. This control enhancement ensures
  that there is predictable behavior in the face of invalid inputs by specifying
  information system responses that facilitate transitioning the system to known
  states without adverse, unintended side effects.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing information input validation; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  information input validation; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  predictable behavior when invalid inputs are received].

cci-definition: '002754: The information system behaves in a predictable and
  documented manner that reflects organizational and system objectives when

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents proper behavior that
  reflects organizational and system objectives for when invalid inputs are
  received. The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information
  system to behave in the documented manner when invalid inputs are received.
  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 2754.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System security plan documents proper behavior that
  reflects organizational and system objectives for when invalid inputs are
  received.

  2.) Configuration documentation that the information system behaves in the
  documented manner when invalid inputs are received.

  3.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks pertaining to CCI 2754.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented behavior to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed documents proper behavior that reflects organizational and
  system objectives for when invalid inputs are received. The organization
  conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information system to ensure
  the organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  behave in the documented manner when invalid inputs are received. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 2754.

test-results: 'Within UDS, Keycloak ensures the system responds predictably and
  consistently when invalid inputs are received. Specifically, when
  authentication or authorization inputs (such as malformed usernames, incorrect
  passwords, or invalid tokens) are submitted, Keycloak responds with
  standardized, generic error messages, avoiding detailed disclosures that could
  aid attackers. All invalid attempts are clearly recorded within Keycloakâs
  detailed audit logs, enabling administrative monitoring and forensic
  analysis.'
