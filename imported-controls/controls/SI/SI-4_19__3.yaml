  Description:

  The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined additional
  monitoring] of individuals who have been identified by [Assignment:
  organization-defined sources] as posing an increased level of risk.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Indications of increased risk from individuals can be obtained from a variety
  of sources including, for example, human resource records, intelligence
  agencies, law enforcement organizations, and/or other credible sources. The
  monitoring of individuals is closely coordinated with management, legal,
  security, and human resources officials within organizations conducting such
  monitoring and complies with federal legislation, Executive Orders, policies,
  directives, regulations, and standards.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing information system monitoring; information system design
  documentation; list of individuals who have been identified as posing an
  increased level of risk; information system monitoring tools and techniques
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility for monitoring the information
  system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for information system
  monitoring; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing system
  monitoring capability].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed implements additional monitoring
  defined in SI-4 (19), CCI 2673 of individuals who have been identified by
  sources defined in SI-4 (19), CCI 2674 as posing an increased level of risk.
  The organization must maintain an audit trail of additional monitoring.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Audit trail of additional monitoring defined in SI-4 (19), CCI 2673 of
  individuals who have been identified by sources defined in SI-4 (19), CCI 2674
  as posing an increased level of risk.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the audit trail of additional monitoring to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed implements additional monitoring defined
  in SI-4 (19), CCI 2673 of individuals who have been identified by sources
  defined in SI-4 (19), CCI 2674 as posing an increased level of risk.
