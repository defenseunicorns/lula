control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization removes [Assignment: organization-defined software and
  firmware components] after updated versions have been installed.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Previous versions of software and/or firmware components that are not removed
  from the information system after updates have been installed may be exploited
  by adversaries. Some information technology products may remove older versions
  of software and/or firmware automatically from the information system.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing flaw remediation; automated mechanisms supporting flaw remediation;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; records of software and firmware
  component removals after updated versions are installed; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility for flaw remediation].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  removal of previous versions of software/firmware].

  DoD has defined the firmware components as all upgraded/replaced firmware
  components that are no longer required for operation.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically compliant.
assessment-procedures: The organization being inspected/assessed is
  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the firmware components as all upgraded/replaced
  firmware components that are no longer required for operation.
