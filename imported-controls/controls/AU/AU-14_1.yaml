  Description:

  The information system provides the capability for authorized users to select
  a user session to capture/record or view/hear.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Session audits include, for example, monitoring keystrokes, tracking websites
  visited, and recording information and/or file transfers. Session auditing
  activities are developed, integrated, and used in consultation with legal
  counsel in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,
  directives, policies, regulations, or standards. Related controls: AC-3, AU-4,
  AU-5, AU-9, AU-11.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  user session auditing; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing user session auditing
  capability].

  authorized users to select a user session to capture/record or view/hear.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  provide the capability for authorized users to select a user session to
  capture/record or view/hear. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 1919.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessments
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to provide the capability
  for authorized users to select a user session to capture/record or view/hear.
  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 1919.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS does not inherently
  provide, support, or facilitate user session capturing, recording, or playback
  capabilities (e.g., screen captures, audio/video recording, or session
  replays). Such functionality, if required, would need to be implemented
  through external monitoring or audit tools at the client endpoint or
  application level, separate from the core UDS technology stack.)
