control-acronym: AU-12(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system compiles audit records from [Assignment:
  organization-defined information system components] into a system-wide
  (logical or physical) audit trail that is time-correlated to within
  [Assignment: organization-defined level of tolerance for relationship between
  time stamps of individual records in the audit trail].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit trails are time-correlated if the time stamps in the individual audit
  records can be reliably related to the time stamps in other audit records to
  achieve a time ordering of the records within organizational tolerances.
  Related controls: AU-8, AU-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit record generation; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; system-wide audit
  trail (logical or physical); information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit record generation
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing audit record generation
  capability].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will define and document the
  information system components from which audit records are to be compiled into
  the system-wide audit trail. The organization will periodically update this
  list to ensure it is current. DoD has determined the information system
  components are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the system-wide audit trail documentation to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed maintains a current list of information
  system components. DoD has determined the information system components are
  not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

test-results: UDS provides comprehensive capabilities to compile audit records
  from critical information system components into a centralized, system-wide
  audit trail. Audit records are systematically collected from key platform
  components, including Keycloak (user authentication and identity management
  events), Istio Service Mesh (network traffic and security policy enforcement
  events), NeuVector (container runtime security events), Kubernetes (cluster
  resource management and operational events), and infrastructure-level events.
  These logs are securely aggregated and centrally stored using Vector and Loki,
  enabling efficient correlation and analysis through Grafana dashboards.
