control-acronym: AU-12
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system:

  a. Provides audit record generation capability for the auditable events
  defined in AU-2 a. at [Assignment: organization-defined information system
  components];

  b. Allows [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to select
  which auditable events are to be audited by specific components of the
  information system; and

  c. Generates audit records for the events defined in AU-2

  d. with the content defined in AU-3.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit records can be generated from many different information system
  components. The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits
  are to be generated. These events are typically a subset of all events for
  which the information system is capable of generating audit records. Related
  controls: AC-3, AU-2, AU-3, AU-6, AU-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit record generation; security plan; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; list of auditable events; information system audit records;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit record generation
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing audit record generation
  capability].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed acquires or designs all information
  system and network components that provide audit record generation capability
  for the auditable events defined in AU-2 a. DoD has defined the information
  system components as all information system and network components.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure that all information system and
  network components provide audit record generation capability for the
  auditable events defined in AU-2 a. DoD has defined the information system
  components as all information system and network components.

  The UDS platform provides comprehensive audit record generation capabilities
  for the auditable events defined in AU-2 across all information system and
  network components. The platform allows designated personnel or roles to
  select which auditable events are to be audited by specific components,
  ensuring flexibility and granularity in audit record generation. Key events
  that are audited include user authentication and access attempts, system and
  application access, configuration changes, data and resource access, network
  activity, security events, system and application errors, and audit and log
  management activities.

  Logs from various components, such as Keycloak, Kubernetes, and NeuVector, are
  collected using Vector and aggregated in Loki. These logs are then visualized
  in Grafana, providing detailed insights into the actions performed within the
  system. The content of the audit records includes essential details such as
  timestamps, user IDs, event types, and outcomes, fulfilling the content
  requirements defined in AU-3. This comprehensive approach ensures that all
  relevant events are captured and can be reviewed, analyzed, and reported as
  needed, in compliance with the control requirements.
