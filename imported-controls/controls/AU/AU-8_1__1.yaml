control-acronym: AU-8(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system:

  (a) Compares the internal information system clocks [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] with [Assignment: organization-defined
  authoritative time source]; and

  (b) Synchronizes the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source
  when the time difference is greater than [Assignment: organization-defined
  time period].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement provides uniformity of time stamps for information
  systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  time stamp generation; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing internal information
  system clock synchronization].

implementation-guidance: |-
  DoD has defined the frequency as every 24 hours for networked systems.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:
  Automatically Compliant
assessment-procedures: The organization being inspected/assessed is
  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the frequency as every 24 hours for networked systems.
