  Description:

  The information system protects against an individual (or process acting on
  behalf of an individual) falsely denying having performed [Assignment:
  organization-defined actions to be covered by non-repudiation].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Types of individual actions covered by non-repudiation include, for example,
  creating information, sending and receiving messages, approving information
  (e.g., indicating concurrence or signing a contract). Non-repudiation protects
  individuals against later claims by: (i) authors of not having authored
  particular documents; (ii) senders of not having transmitted messages; (iii)
  receivers of not having received messages; or (iv) signatories of not having
  signed documents. Non-repudiation services can be used to determine if
  information originated from a particular individual, or if an individual took
  specific actions (e.g., sending an email, signing a contract, approving a
  procurement request) or received specific information. Organizations obtain
  non-repudiation services by employing various techniques or mechanisms (e.g.,
  digital signatures, digital message receipts). Related controls: SC-12, SC-8,
  SC-13, SC-16, SC-17, SC-23.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  protect against an individual falsely denying having performed actions to be
  covered by non-repudiation defined in DoDI 8520.02 and DoDI 8520.03. DoDI
  8520.02 and DoDI 8520.03 meet the DoD requirement to define the actions to be
  covered by non-repudiation. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 166.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed protects against an individual falsely denying having
  performed actions to be covered by non-repudiation defined in DoDI 8520.02 and
  DoDI 8520.03. DoDI 8520.02 and DoDI 8520.03 meet the DoD requirement to define
  the actions to be covered by non-repudiation. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 166.

test-results: UDS provides strong technical mechanisms to protect against false
  denial (non-repudiation) through comprehensive audit logging and identity
  management solutions. Specifically, UDS leverages centralized identity
  management (Keycloak) to reliably authenticate user identities using PKI-based
  credentials (such as CAC/PIV), which provide cryptographically strong proof of
  identity. Detailed audit logs captured via Vector and centrally stored in Loki
  provide immutable, timestamped records of user activities, ensuring
  traceability of critical actions. Additionally, the use of mutual TLS (mTLS)
  within Istio Service Mesh provides cryptographic validation of transactions
  between microservices.
