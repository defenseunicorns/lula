control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system provides the capability to process audit records for
  events of interest based on [Assignment: organization-defined audit fields
  within audit records].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Events of interest can be identified by the content of specific audit record
  fields including, for example, identities of individuals, event types, event
  locations, event times, event dates, system resources involved, IP addresses
  involved, or information objects accessed. Organizations may define audit
  event criteria to any degree of granularity required, for example, locations
  selectable by general networking location (e.g., by network or subnetwork) or
  selectable by specific information system component. Related controls: AU-2,
  AU-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit reduction and report generation; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; audit reduction, review, analysis, and reporting tools; audit
  record criteria (fields) establishing events of interest; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit reduction and
  report generation responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Audit reduction and report generation capability].

cci-definition: '001883: The organization defines the audit fields within audit
  records to be processed for events of interest by the information system.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed must define and document the audit
  fields within audit records to be processed for events of interest by the
  information system. DoD has determined that the audit fields are not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy

  2.) Example of audit log report based on events of interest
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented audit fields to ensure the organization
  being inspected/assessed defines the audit fields within audit records to be
  processed for events of interest by the information system. DoD has determined
  that the audit fields are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

test-results: UDS provides extensive audit logging capabilities through its
  integrated logging and monitoring components (Vector and Loki), enabling
  comprehensive capture of audit fields including user identity, timestamps,
  source/destination addresses, actions performed, and authentication outcomes.
  UDS allows administrators to configure and define precisely which audit fields
  are collected, processed, and analyzed, ensuring logs contain sufficient
  details to investigate security events thoroughly.
