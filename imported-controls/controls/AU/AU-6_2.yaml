control-acronym: AU-6
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Reviews and analyzes information system audit records [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] for indications of [Assignment:
  organization-defined inappropriate or unusual activity]; and

  b. Reports findings to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit review, analysis, and reporting covers information security-related
  auditing performed by organizations including, for example, auditing that
  results from monitoring of account usage, remote access, wireless
  connectivity, mobile device connection, configuration settings, system
  component inventory, use of maintenance tools and nonlocal maintenance,
  physical access, temperature and humidity, equipment delivery and removal,
  communications at the information system boundaries, use of mobile code, and
  use of VoIP. Findings can be reported to organizational entities that include,
  for example, incident response team, help desk, information security
  group/department. If organizations are prohibited from reviewing and analyzing
  audit information or unable to conduct such activities (e.g., in certain
  national security applications or systems), the review/analysis may be carried
  out by other organizations granted such authority. Related controls: AC-2,

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit review, analysis, and reporting; reports of audit findings; records of
  actions taken in response to reviews/analyses of audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit review, analysis,
  and reporting responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].
