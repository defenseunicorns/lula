  Description:

  The information system protects audit information and audit tools from
  unauthorized access, modification, and deletion.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit
  settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system
  activity. This control focuses on technical protection of audit information.
  Physical protection of audit information is addressed by media protection
  controls and physical and environmental protection controls. Related controls:
  AC-3, AC-6, MP-2, MP-4, PE-2, PE-3, PE-6.


  Added by [r4] Privacy (Confidentiality Impact Level: Moderate) Overlay:
  Related Control: AU-4(1).


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; access control policy
  and procedures; procedures addressing protection of audit information;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation, information system audit records; audit
  tools; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing audit information
  protection].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] Privacy (Confidentiality Impact Level: Moderate) Overlay: When
  audit information contains PII or PHI, it must be protected commensurate with
  its PII confidentiality impact level. Audit information could be necessary to
  enforce criminal or civil penalties under the Privacy Act. Protecting audit
  records from compromise by applying this control enhancement helps ensure
  their availability when needed.

cci: 1495
cci-definition: '001495: The information system protects audit tools from
  unauthorized deletion.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  disallow unauthorized deletion of audit tools. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  1495.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) List of privileged users who will be authorized access to the management
  of audit functionality
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure that the organization being
  inspected/assessed has configured the information system to disallow
  unauthorized deletion of audit tools. For information system components that
  have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 1495.
