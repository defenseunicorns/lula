control-acronym: AU-3(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system generates audit records containing the following
  additional information: [Assignment: organization-defined additional, more
  detailed information].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Detailed information that organizations may consider in audit records
  includes, for example, full text recording of privileged commands or the
  individual identities of group account users. Organizations consider limiting
  the additional audit information to only that information explicitly needed
  for specific audit requirements. This facilitates the use of audit trails and
  audit logs by not including information that could potentially be misleading
  or could make it more difficult to locate information of interest.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  content of audit records; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; list of
  organization-defined auditable events; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Information system audit capability].

cci-definition: '001488: The organization defines additional, more detailed
  information to be included in the audit records.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents additional,
  more detailed information to be included in the audit records. The additional
  information must include at a minimum, full-text recording of privileged
  commands or the individual identities of group account users. The additional
  information must provide sufficient detail to reconstruct events to determine
  cause of compromise and magnitude of damage, malfunction, or security
  violation.

  DoD has determined that additional, more detailed information must include, at
  a minimum, full-text recording of privileged commands or the individual
  identities of group account users. DoD has determined that all additional,
  more detailed information is not appropriate to define at the Enterprise
  level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy and/or procedures
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented list of additional more detailed information to be included in the
  audit records to ensure that:

  1. The list is defined; and

  2. The list includes full-text recording of privileged commands or the
  individual identities of group account users.

  DoD has determined that additional, more detailed information must include, at
  a minimum, full-text recording of privileged commands or the individual
  identities of group account users. DoD has determined that it is not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

compliance-status: Compliant
test-results: UDS can generate additional custom audit records tailored to
  organization defined data requirements. To meet this CCI the organization must
  define any additional audit record requirements before implementation. By
  default UDS does at a minimum provide recording of privileged commands.
