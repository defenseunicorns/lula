control-acronym: AU-5
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system:

  a. Alerts [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] in the event
  of an audit processing failure; and

  b. Takes the following additional actions: [Assignment: organization-defined
  actions to be taken (e.g., shut down information system, overwrite oldest
  audit records, stop generating audit records)].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit processing failures include, for example, software/hardware errors,
  failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being
  reached or exceeded. Organizations may choose to define additional actions for
  different audit processing failures (e.g., by type, by location, by severity,
  or a combination of such factors). This control applies to each audit data
  storage repository (i.e., distinct information system component where audit
  records are stored), the total audit storage capacity of organizations (i.e.,
  all audit data storage repositories combined), or both. Related controls:
  AU-4, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  response to audit processing failures; information system design
  documentation; security plan; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; list of personnel to be notified in case of an audit
  processing failure; information system audit records; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing information system
  response to audit processing failures].

cci: 1572
cci-definition: '001572: The organization defines the personnel or roles to be
  alerted in the event of an audit processing failure.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents any personnel
  or roles, in addition to the SCA and ISSO, who shall be alerted in the event
  of audit processing failure. If there are no additional personnel or roles,
  the organization must also document that. DoD has defined the personnel or
  roles as at a minimum, the SCA and ISSO.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented list of personnel or roles who should be
  alerted in the event of audit processing failure to ensure the organization
  being inspected/assessed has either defined additional personnel or roles, or
  identified that there are no additional personnel or roles. DoD has defined
  the personnel or roles as at a minimum, the SCA and ISSO.

test-results: 'UDS alerts and notifications are enabled through Grafana and are
  located under the âAlertingâ menu in the left sidebar. Next, create your
  contact points by navigating to Alerting then Contact points, clicking New
  contact point, giving it a name (e.g., âEmail Alertsâ or âMattermost
  Alertsâ), selecting a contact type, and filling in the relevant details
  (such as a Mattermost Webhook URL or email addresses). Finally, set up your
  notification policies under Alerting then Notification policies, where you
  will configure a root policy to select a default contact point and, if needed,
  define child policies that match specific labels (for example, sending
  critical alerts to a third party tool like PagerDuty contact point and all
  others to a Mattermost channel).'
