control-acronym: AU-8
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system:

  a. Uses internal system clocks to generate time stamps for audit records; and

  b. Records time stamps for audit records that can be mapped to Coordinated
  Universal Time (UTC) or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and meets [Assignment:
  organization-defined granularity of time measurement].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Time stamps generated by the information system include date and time. Time is
  commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation
  of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC.
  Granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization
  between information system clocks and reference clocks, for example, clocks
  synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or within tens of milliseconds.
  Organizations may define different time granularities for different system
  components. Time service can also be critical to other security capabilities
  such as access control and identification and authentication, depending on the
  nature of the mechanisms used to support those capabilities. Related controls:
  AU-3, AU-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  time stamp generation; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing time stamp generation].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  use internal system clocks to generate time stamps for audit records. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 159.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure that the organization being
  inspected/assessed has configured the information system to use internal
  system clocks to generate time stamps for audit records. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization
  conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that
  the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the information
  system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 159.

test-results: 'Time synchronization is assumed by UDS. All components (Keycloak,
  Istio, NeuVector, nodes, etc.) rely on the underlying system clock. In a
  typical deployment, the Kubernetes nodes synchronize time via NTP or other
  means. UDS does ensure that containers use the hostâs time, so all logs have
  timestamps in the same time base. In an environment where NTP is configured on
  all nodes, this means audit events from different sources can be correlated
  accurately. UDS doesnât include an NTP server, so the organization must
  ensure time sync on the infrastructure.'
