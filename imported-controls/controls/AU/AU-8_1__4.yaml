control-acronym: AU-8(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system:

  (a) Compares the internal information system clocks [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] with [Assignment: organization-defined
  authoritative time source]; and

  (b) Synchronizes the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source
  when the time difference is greater than [Assignment: organization-defined
  time period].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement provides uniformity of time stamps for information
  systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  time stamp generation; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing internal information
  system clock synchronization].

cci-definition: '001892: The organization defines the time difference which,
  when exceeded, will require the information system to synchronize the internal
  information system clocks to the organization-defined authoritative time
  source.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the time
  difference, which, when exceeded, will require the information system to
  synchronize the internal information system clocks. DoD has determined the
  time difference is not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented time difference to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  defines the time difference which, when exceeded, will require the information
  system to synchronize the internal information system clocks.


  DoD has determined the time difference is not appropriate to define at the
  Enterprise level.

test-results: While UDS does not include an NTP server, it is designed to
  utilize the time synchronization mechanisms provided by the underlying
  infrastructure. Therefore, it is the responsibility of Mission Hero to
  configure and maintain time synchronization on the infrastructure. This
  includes comparing internal information system clocks with an authoritative
  time source at an organization-defined frequency and synchronizing the clocks
  when the time difference exceeds an organization-defined threshold.
