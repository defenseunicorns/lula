  Description:

  The information system provides the capability for authorized users to
  capture/record and log content related to a user session.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  user session auditing; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing user session auditing
  capability].

cci-definition: '001462: The information system provides the capability for
  authorized users to capture/record and log content related to a user session.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  provide the capability for authorized users to capture/record and log content
  related to a user session. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 1462.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) List of privileged users who will be authorized access to the management
  of audit functionality
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to provide the capability
  for authorized users to capture/record and log content related to a user
  session. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs,
  the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components
  to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 1462.

test-results: The UDS platform provides the capability for authorized users to
  capture, record, and log content related to a user session. This functionality
  is implemented across all components of the UDS platform, including Keycloak,
  Kubernetes, and NeuVector. Authorized users, typically those with privileged
  access, can utilize this capability to ensure that all relevant session
  activities are logged and monitored. Logs generated during user sessions
  capture essential details such as user actions, timestamps, and session
  content. These logs are collected using Vector and aggregated in Loki,
  providing a centralized repository for audit records. Grafana is used to
  visualize and analyze the session logs, offering insights into user activities
  and ensuring comprehensive session auditing.
