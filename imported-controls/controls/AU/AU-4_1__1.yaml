control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system off-loads audit records [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] onto a different system or media than the
  system being audited.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Off-loading is a process designed to preserve the confidentiality and
  integrity of audit records by moving the records from the primary information
  system to a secondary or alternate system. It is a common process in
  information systems with limited audit storage capacity; the audit storage is
  used only in a transitory fashion until the system can communicate with the
  secondary or alternate system designated for storing the audit records, at
  which point the information is transferred.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit storage capacity; procedures addressing transfer of information system
  audit records to secondary or alternate systems; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; logs of audit record transfers to secondary or alternate
  systems; information system audit records transferred to secondary or
  alternate systems; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit storage capacity
  planning responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting transfer of audit records
  onto a different system].

cci-definition: '001850: The organization defines the frequency on which the
  information system off-loads audit records onto a different system or media
  than the system being audited.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  DoD has defined the frequency as at a minimum, real-time for interconnected
  systems and weekly for stand-alone systems.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically Compliant
assessment-procedures: The organization being inspected/assessed is
  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the frequency as at a minimum, real-time for
  interconnected systems and weekly for stand-alone systems.
