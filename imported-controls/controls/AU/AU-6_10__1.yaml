  Description:

  The organization adjusts the level of audit review, analysis, and reporting
  within the information system when there is a change in risk based on law
  enforcement information, intelligence information, or other credible sources
  of information.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The frequency, scope, and/or depth of the audit review, analysis, and
  reporting may be adjusted to meet organizational needs based on new
  information received.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
