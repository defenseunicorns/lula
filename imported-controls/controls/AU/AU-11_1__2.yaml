  Description:

  The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined measures] to ensure
  that long-term audit records generated by the information system can be
  retrieved.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Measures employed by organizations to help facilitate the retrieval of audit
  records include, for example, converting records to newer formats, retaining
  equipment capable of reading the records, and retaining necessary
  documentation to help organizational personnel understand how to interpret the
  records.


  Added by [r4] Privacy (Confidentiality Impact Level: Moderate) Overlay: When
  audit information contains PII, ensure long-term retrieval systems adequately
  address necessary safeguards to protect that PII.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit record retention
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].
