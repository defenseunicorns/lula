control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system provides the capability to sort and search audit
  records for events of interest based on the content of [Assignment:
  organization-defined audit fields within audit records].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Sorting and searching of audit records may be based upon the contents of audit
  record fields, for example: (i) date/time of events; (ii) user identifiers;
  (iii) Internet Protocol (IP) addresses involved in the event; (iv) type of
  event; or (v) event success/failure.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit reduction and report generation; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; audit reduction, review, analysis, and reporting tools; audit
  record criteria (fields) establishing events of interest; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit reduction and
  report generation responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Audit reduction and report generation capability].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed must employ information systems that
  provide the capability to search audit records for events of interest based on
  the content of audit fields within audit records as defined in AU-7 (2), CCI
  1885. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs,
  the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG
  guidance that pertains to CCI 1887.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy

  2.) Example of audit log report based on events of interest
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure that the organization being
  inspected/assessed employs information systems that provide the capability to
  search audit records for events of interest based on the content of audit
  fields within audit records as defined in AU-7 (2), CCI 1885. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization
  conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that
  the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the information
  system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI
  1887.

test-results: UDS fully provides the capability to search audit records based on
  organizationally defined audit fields through its integrated logging and
  analytics solutions (Vector, Loki, and Grafana). Audit logs are systematically
  captured, indexed, and stored within Loki, enabling administrators to perform
  powerful, structured searches across a wide range of organizationally defined
  audit fields, including timestamps, user identities, IP addresses, event
  types, actions performed, and authentication outcomes. Grafana's intuitive
  dashboards further simplify and enhance this capability by allowing targeted,
  real-time searches and visual analysis of security events. Thus, UDS
  completely satisfies the requirement for searching audit records based on
  defined audit fields, fully aligning with organizational security monitoring
  and investigative needs.
