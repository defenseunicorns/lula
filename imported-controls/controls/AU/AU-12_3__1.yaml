control-acronym: AU-12(3)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system provides the capability for [Assignment:
  organization-defined individuals or roles] to change the auditing to be
  performed on [Assignment: organization-defined information system components]
  based on [Assignment: organization-defined selectable event criteria] within
  [Assignment: organization-defined time thresholds].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement enables organizations to extend or limit auditing as
  necessary to meet organizational requirements. Auditing that is limited to
  conserve information system resources may be extended to address certain
  threat situations. In addition, auditing may be limited to a specific set of
  events to facilitate audit reduction, analysis, and reporting. Organizations
  can establish time thresholds in which audit actions are changed, for example,
  near real-time, within minutes, or within hours. Related control: AU-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit record generation; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; system-generated
  list of individuals or roles authorized to change auditing to be performed;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit record generation
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing audit record generation
  capability].

cci-definition: '001911: The organization defines the selectable event criteria
  to be used as the basis for changes to the auditing to be performed on
  organization-defined information system components, by organization-defined
  individuals or roles, within organization-defined time thresholds.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the selectable
  event criteria for which changed auditing is to be performed. DoD has
  determined the selectable event criteria is not appropriate to define at the
  Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy, referencing section
  pertaining to selectable event criteria to be used as the basis for changes to
  the auditing

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented selectable event criteria to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed defines the selectable event criteria
  for which changed auditing is to be performed. DoD has determined the
  selectable event criteria is not appropriate to define at the Enterprise
  level.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS provides flexible and
  dynamic auditing capabilities through its integrated logging and monitoring
  solutions (Vector, Loki, and Grafana). These solutions enable administrators
  or designated organizational roles to dynamically adjust audit configurations
  based on selectable event criteria, such as user authentication events, access
  violations, administrative changes, or specific system alerts. The
  configurable nature of these tools supports rapid updates to auditing rules
  and criteria, facilitating real-time adaptation to emerging threats or
  organizational requirements. However, explicitly defining and documenting the
  precise selectable event criteria, authorized individuals or roles permitted
  to change auditing configurations, and specific time thresholds for
  implementing these changes remains an organizational responsibility.
  Organizations deploying UDS must clearly establish these criteria within
  internal security policies or audit procedures to fully comply with this
  control.)
