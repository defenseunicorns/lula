control-acronym: AU-9(4)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization authorizes access to management of audit functionality to
  only [Assignment: organization-defined subset of privileged users].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Individuals with privileged access to an information system and who are also
  the subject of an audit by that system, may affect the reliability of audit
  information by inhibiting audit activities or modifying audit records. This
  control enhancement requires that privileged access be further defined between
  audit-related privileges and other privileges, thus limiting the users with
  audit-related privileges. Related control: AC-5.


  Added by [r4] Privacy (Confidentiality Impact Level: Moderate) Overlay: When
  audit information contains PII, the requirement for access to that audit
  information is the same as for access to PII generally. As such, access to PII
  in audit logs requires a need-to-know and privacy training commensurate with
  level of responsibility and access. Privileged users must be evaluated to
  determine if they have such a need-to-know as part of his or her security
  function. Related Control: AR-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; access control policy
  and procedures; procedures addressing protection of audit information;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation, system-generated list of privileged
  users with access to management of audit functionality; access authorizations;
  access control list; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms managing access to audit
  functionality].

  The organization being inspected/assessed authorizes access to the management
  of audit functionality to only the subset of privileged users defined in AU-9
  (4), CCI 1894.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) List of privileged users who will be authorized access to the management
  of audit functionality
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documentation of access authorizations for the
  management of audit functionality to ensure only the subset of privileged
  users defined in AU-9 (4), CCI 1894 have been granted access authorization.
