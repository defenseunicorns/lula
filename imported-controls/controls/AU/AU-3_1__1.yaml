control-acronym: AU-3(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system generates audit records containing the following
  additional information: [Assignment: organization-defined additional, more
  detailed information].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Detailed information that organizations may consider in audit records
  includes, for example, full text recording of privileged commands or the
  individual identities of group account users. Organizations consider limiting
  the additional audit information to only that information explicitly needed
  for specific audit requirements. This facilitates the use of audit trails and
  audit logs by not including information that could potentially be misleading
  or could make it more difficult to locate information of interest.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  content of audit records; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; list of
  organization-defined auditable events; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Information system audit capability].

cci-definition: '000135: The information system generates audit records
  containing the organization-defined additional, more detailed information that
  is to be included in the audit records.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  generate audit records containing the organization defined additional, more
  detailed information as defined in AU-3 (1), CCI 1488 that is to be included
  in the audit records.


  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 135.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Sample of generated audit records

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured
  the information system to generate audit records containing the organization
  defined additional, more detailed information as defined in AU-3 (1), CCI 1488
  that is to be included in the audit records. The organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment reviews the audit records generated to ensure that the
  records contain organization defined additional, more detailed information
  that is to be included in the audit records.

  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 135.

test-results: UDS can generate additional custom audit records tailored to
  organization defined data requirements. To meet this CCI the organization must
  define any additional audit record requirements before implementation. By
  default UDS does at a minimum provide recording of privileged commands.
