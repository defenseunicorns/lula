control-acronym: AU-12(3)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system provides the capability for [Assignment:
  organization-defined individuals or roles] to change the auditing to be
  performed on [Assignment: organization-defined information system components]
  based on [Assignment: organization-defined selectable event criteria] within
  [Assignment: organization-defined time thresholds].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement enables organizations to extend or limit auditing as
  necessary to meet organizational requirements. Auditing that is limited to
  conserve information system resources may be extended to address certain
  threat situations. In addition, auditing may be limited to a specific set of
  events to facilitate audit reduction, analysis, and reporting. Organizations
  can establish time thresholds in which audit actions are changed, for example,
  near real-time, within minutes, or within hours. Related control: AU-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit record generation; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; system-generated
  list of individuals or roles authorized to change auditing to be performed;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit record generation
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing audit record generation
  capability].

cci-definition: '001913: The organization defines the individuals or roles that
  are to be provided the capability to change the auditing to be performed based

  time thresholds.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the
  individuals or roles that are to be provided the capability to change the
  auditing to be performed based on the selectable event criteria defined in
  AU-12 (3), CCI 1911, within the time thresholds defined in AU-12 (3), CCI
  1912. DoD has determined that the individuals or roles are not appropriate to
  define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy, referencing section
  which defines the individuals or roles that are to be provided the capability
  to change the auditing.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented individuals or roles to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed defines the individuals or roles that
  are to be provided the capability to change the auditing to be performed based
  on the selectable event criteria defined in AU-12 (3), CCI 1911, within the
  time thresholds defined in AU-12 (3), CCI 1912. DoD has determined that the
  individuals or roles are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS enables specific
  authorized individuals or roles to dynamically modify auditing configurations
  through its integrated logging and monitoring tools (Vector, Loki, and
  Grafana). Administrative control over audit configuration changes is strictly
  managed via centralized identity management (Keycloak) and Kubernetes
  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), allowing the organization to explicitly
  define and restrict roles (such as Security Administrators or Audit Managers)
  authorized to modify audit settings in response to defined event criteria.
  However, formally identifying and documenting the specific individuals or
  roles permitted to adjust auditing, as well as defining precise event criteria
  and time thresholds for these adjustments, remains an organizational
  responsibility.)
