  Description:

  The organization retains [Assignment: organization-defined previous versions
  of baseline configurations of the information system] to support rollback.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Retaining previous versions of baseline configurations to support rollback may
  include, for example, hardware, software, firmware, configuration files, and
  configuration records.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  the baseline configuration of the information system; configuration management
  plan; information system architecture and configuration documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation; copies
  of previous baseline configuration versions; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing baseline
  configurations].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed retains the previous approved
  baseline configuration of IS components for a minimum of 3 months and
  documents baseline configuration to support rollback. The goal is to verify
  that the IS can roll back components to previous versions. DoD has defined the
  previous versions as the previous approved baseline configuration of IS
  components for a minimum of 3 months.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated previous versions of baseline configurations
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documentation of the previous version of the baseline
  configuration to determine if all IS components necessary for rollback are
  retained. DoD has defined the previous versions as the previous approved
  baseline configuration of IS components for a minimum of 3 months.

compliance-status: Compliant
test-results: UDS fully supports retention of previous baseline configurations
  for rollback purposes through its use of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via
  OpenTofu, along with secure deployment mechanisms utilizing signed Zarf
  packages. These tools inherently maintain complete, version-controlled
  histories of baseline configurations, including previous software versions,
  container images, infrastructure settings, and dependencies, enabling rapid
  rollback to stable or previously approved system states. Additionally,
  configuration histories are securely stored, auditable, and retained to meet
  the DoD-defined requirement, specifically retaining the previously approved
  baseline configurations of information system components for a minimum
  duration of three months. This built-in capability ensures robust rollback
  support and aligns precisely with the DoD retention standards and
  organizational rollback policies.
