control-acronym: CM-7(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Reviews the information system [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency] to identify unnecessary and/or nonsecure functions, ports,
  protocols, and services; and

  (b) Disables [Assignment: organization-defined functions, ports, protocols,
  and services within the information system deemed to be unnecessary and/or
  nonsecure].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The organization can either make a determination of the relative security of
  the function, port, protocol, and/or service or base the security decision on
  the assessment of other entities. Bluetooth, FTP, and peer-to-peer networking
  are examples of less than secure protocols. Related controls: AC-18, CM-7,
  IA-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  least functionality in the information system; configuration management plan;
  security plan; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; security configuration
  checklists; documented reviews of functions, ports, protocols, and/or
  services; change control records; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  reviewing functions, ports, protocols, and services on the information system;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for reviewing/disabling nonsecure
  functions, ports, protocols, and/or services; automated mechanisms
  implementing review and disabling of nonsecure functions, ports, protocols,
  and/or services].
