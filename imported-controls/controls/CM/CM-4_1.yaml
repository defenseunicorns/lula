control-acronym: CM-4
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization analyzes changes to the information system to determine
  potential security impacts prior to change implementation.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizational personnel with information security responsibilities (e.g.,
  Information System Administrators, Information System Security Officers,
  Information System Security Managers, and Information System Security
  Engineers) conduct security impact analyses. Individuals conducting security
  impact analyses possess the necessary skills/technical expertise to analyze
  the changes to information systems and the associated security ramifications.
  Security impact analysis may include, for example, reviewing security plans to
  understand security control requirements and reviewing system design
  documentation to understand control implementation and how specific changes
  might affect the controls. Security impact analyses may also include
  assessments of risk to better understand the impact of the changes and to
  determine if additional security controls are required. Security impact
  analyses are scaled in accordance with the security categories of the
  information systems. Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, CM-3, CM-9, SA-4, SA-5,
  SA-10, SI-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  security impact analysis for changes to the information system; configuration
  management plan; security impact analysis documentation; analysis tools and
  associated outputs; change control records; information system audit records;
  other relevant documents or records].

  conducting security impact analysis; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed analyzes changes to the information
  system to determine potential security impacts prior to change implementation.
  The organization must maintain records of analysis of changes to the
  information system.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated change management testing procedures
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the records of analyses to ensure the organization is
  conducting a security impact analysis of changes to the information system(s)
  prior to their implementation.

test-results: UDS provides technical capabilities to support the analysis of
  potential security impacts of changes to the information system prior to
  implementation. Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with OpenTofu and secure,
  version-controlled deployments via signed Zarf packages, UDS allows
  comprehensive visibility into proposed changes, facilitating detailed security
  impact analyses. Zarf provides detailed SBOMs and Defense Unicorns provides
  CVE scans through grype.
