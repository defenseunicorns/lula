control-acronym: CM-5
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization defines, documents, approves, and enforces physical and
  logical access restrictions associated with changes to the information system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of
  information systems can potentially have significant effects on the overall
  security of the systems. Therefore, organizations permit only qualified and
  authorized individuals to access information systems for purposes of
  initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications. Organizations
  maintain records of access to ensure that configuration change control is
  implemented and to support after-the-fact actions should organizations
  discover any unauthorized changes. Access restrictions for change also include
  software libraries. Access restrictions include, for example, physical and
  logical access controls (see AC-3 and PE-3), workflow automation, media
  libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes implemented into third-party
  interfaces rather than directly into information systems), and change windows
  (e.g., changes occur only during specified times, making unauthorized changes
  easy to discover). Related controls: AC-3, AC-6, PE-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  access restrictions for changes to the information system; configuration
  management plan; information system design documentation; information system
  architecture and configuration documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; logical access approvals; physical
  access approvals; access credentials; change control records; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with logical access control
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with physical access control
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing access restrictions
  to change; automated mechanisms supporting/implementing/enforcing access
  restrictions associated with changes to the information system].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to enforce logical access restrictions associated with changes to the
  information system. The information system must maintain an audit trail of
  logical access to the information system pertaining to information system
  changes.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated configuration management policy referencing logical
  access restrictions section
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process as well as the logical access
  audit trail to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed enforces
  logical access restrictions associated with changes to the information system
  as documented in the configuration management policy.

test-results: UDS effectively enforces logical access restrictions associated
  with information system changes through integrated identity and access
  management solutions. Centralized authentication and authorization managed by
  Keycloak, combined with Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), ensures
  that only explicitly authorized individuals or roles can implement system
  modifications. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via OpenTofu and secure software
  deployments using signed Zarf packages enforce these access controls
  systematically, providing automated validation and auditing of permissions
  during the deployment process. Additionally, the policy engine Pepr
  proactively blocks unauthorized configuration changes. Collectively, these
  integrated mechanisms enforce strong logical access restrictions, fully
  satisfying this control.
