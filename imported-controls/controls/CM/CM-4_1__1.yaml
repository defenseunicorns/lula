control-acronym: CM-4(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization analyzes changes to the information system in a separate test
  environment before implementation in an operational environment, looking for
  security impacts due to flaws, weaknesses, incompatibility, or intentional
  malice.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Separate test environment in this context means an environment that is
  physically or logically isolated and distinct from the operational
  environment. The separation is sufficient to ensure that activities in the
  test environment do not impact activities in the operational environment, and
  information in the operational environment is not inadvertently transmitted to
  the test environment. Separate environments can be achieved by physical or
  logical means. If physically separate test environments are not used,
  organizations determine the strength of mechanism required when implementing
  logical separation (e.g., separation achieved through virtual machines).

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  security impact analysis for changes to the information system; configuration
  management plan; security impact analysis documentation; analysis tools and
  associated outputs information system design documentation; information system
  architecture and configuration documentation; change control records;
  information system audit records; documentation evidence of separate test and
  operational environments; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  conducting security impact analysis; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for security impact analysis;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing security impact analysis
  of changes].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents within their process for
  analyzing changes to the information system, methods for identifying security
  impacts due to flaws, weaknesses, incompatibility, or intentional malice. The
  organization implements the documented process and must maintain a record of
  analysis.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documented methods for identifying security impacts due to flaws,
  weaknesses, incompatibility, or intentional malice
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process and record of analysis to ensure
  the organization being inspected/assessed, when analyzing changes to the
  information system, looks for security impacts due to flaws, weaknesses,
  incompatibility, or intentional malice.
inherited: Local
remote-inheritance-instance: '-'
test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The UDS technology stack
  provides all the information needed to analyze changes, but the responsibility
  for conducting the analysis of changes to the information system in a separate
  test environment, looking for security impacts due to flaws, weaknesses,
  incompatibility, or intentional malice, lies with the organization.)
