  Description:

  The organization retains [Assignment: organization-defined previous versions
  of baseline configurations of the information system] to support rollback.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Retaining previous versions of baseline configurations to support rollback may
  include, for example, hardware, software, firmware, configuration files, and
  configuration records.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  the baseline configuration of the information system; configuration management
  plan; information system architecture and configuration documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation; copies
  of previous baseline configuration versions; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing baseline
  configurations].

  DoD has defined the previous versions as the previous approved baseline
  configuration of IS components for a minimum of 3 month.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically Compliant
assessment-procedures: The organization being inspected/assessed is
  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the previous versions as the previous approved baseline
  configuration of IS components for a minimum of 3 month.
