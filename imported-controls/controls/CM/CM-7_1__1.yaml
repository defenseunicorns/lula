control-acronym: CM-7(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Reviews the information system [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency] to identify unnecessary and/or nonsecure functions, ports,
  protocols, and services; and

  (b) Disables [Assignment: organization-defined functions, ports, protocols,
  and services within the information system deemed to be unnecessary and/or
  nonsecure].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The organization can either make a determination of the relative security of
  the function, port, protocol, and/or service or base the security decision on
  the assessment of other entities. Bluetooth, FTP, and peer-to-peer networking
  are examples of less than secure protocols. Related controls: AC-18, CM-7,
  IA-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  least functionality in the information system; configuration management plan;
  security plan; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; security configuration
  checklists; documented reviews of functions, ports, protocols, and/or
  services; change control records; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  reviewing functions, ports, protocols, and services on the information system;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for reviewing/disabling nonsecure
  functions, ports, protocols, and/or services; automated mechanisms
  implementing review and disabling of nonsecure functions, ports, protocols,
  and/or services].

cci-definition: '000384: The organization reviews the information system per
  organization defined frequency to identify unnecessary and nonsecure
  functions, ports, protocols, and services.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to review the information system every 30 days to identify unnecessary and
  nonsecure functions, ports, protocols, and services. The organization must
  maintain an audit trail of the reviews. DoD has defined the frequency as every
  30 days.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Approved ports, protocols, and/or services list

  2.) Audit trail of ports, protocols, and/or services scan and/or review
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process and audit trail of reviews to
  ensure the organization being inspected/assessed reviews the information
  system every 30 days to identify unnecessary and nonsecure functions, ports,
  protocols, and services. DoD has defined the frequency as every 30 days.
