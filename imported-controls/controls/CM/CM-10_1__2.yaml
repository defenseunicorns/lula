  Description:

  The organization establishes the following restrictions on the use of open
  source software: [Assignment: organization-defined restrictions].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Open source software refers to software that is available in source code form.
  Certain software rights normally reserved for copyright holders are routinely
  provided under software license agreements that permit individuals to study,
  change, and improve the software. From a security perspective, the major
  advantage of open source software is that it provides organizations with the
  ability to examine the source code. However, there are also various licensing
  issues associated with open source software including, for example, the
  constraints on derivative use of such software.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  restrictions on use of open source software; configuration management plan;
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  establishing and enforcing restrictions on use of open source software;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational process for restricting the use of open
  source software; automated mechanisms implementing restrictions on the use of
  open source software].
