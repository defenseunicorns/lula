control-acronym: CM-5(5)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Limits privileges to change information system components and
  system-related information within a production or operational environment; and

  (b) Reviews and reevaluates privileges [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  In many organizations, information systems support multiple core
  missions/business functions. Limiting privileges to change information system
  components with respect to operational systems is necessary because changes to
  a particular information system component may have far-reaching effects on
  mission/business processes supported by the system where the component
  resides. The complex, many-to-many relationships between systems and
  mission/business processes are in some cases, unknown to developers. Related
  control: AC-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  access restrictions for changes to the information system; configuration
  management plan; security plan; information system design documentation;
  information system architecture and configuration documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; user privilege
  reviews; user privilege recertifications; change control records; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing access restrictions
  to change; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing access
  restrictions for change].
