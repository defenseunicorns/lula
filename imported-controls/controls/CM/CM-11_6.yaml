control-acronym: CM-11
control-information: 'Description:

  The organization:

  a. Establishes [Assignment: organization-defined policies] governing the
  installation of software by users;

  b. Enforces software installation policies through [Assignment:
  organization-defined methods]; and

  c. Monitors policy compliance at [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  If provided the necessary privileges, users have the ability to install
  software in organizational information systems. To maintain control over the
  types of software installed, organizations identify permitted and prohibited
  actions regarding software installation. Permitted software installations may
  include, for example, updates and security patches to existing software and
  downloading applications from organization-approved âapp stores.â
  Prohibited software installations may include, for example, software with
  unknown or suspect pedigrees or software that organizations consider
  potentially malicious. The policies organizations select governing
  user-installed software may be organization-developed or provided by some
  external entity. Policy enforcement methods include procedural methods (e.g.,
  periodic examination of user accounts), automated methods (e.g., configuration
  settings implemented on organizational information systems), or both. Related
  controls: AC-3, CM-2, CM-3, CM-5, CM-6, CM-7, PL-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  user installed software; configuration management plan; security plan;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; list of rules governing user installed
  software; information system monitoring records; information system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records; continuous monitoring strategy].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  governing user-installed software; organizational personnel operating, using,
  and/or maintaining the information system; organizational personnel monitoring
  compliance with user-installed software policy; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes governing user-installed software
  on the information system; automated mechanisms enforcing rules/methods for
  governing the installation of software by users; automated mechanisms
  monitoring policy compliance].'

cci-definition: '001809: The organization monitors software installation policy
  compliance per organization-defined frequency.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed must monitor software installation
  policy compliance at least monthly. The organization must maintain audit
  trails of monitoring activity. DoD has defined the frequency as at least
  monthly.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated configuration management plan
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the audit trails of monitoring activities to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed monitors software installation policy
  compliance at least monthly. DoD has defined the frequency as at least
  monthly.

compliance-status: Compliant
test-results: UDS supports continuous, automated monitoring for compliance with
  software installation policies through integrated security and monitoring
  components. Centralized logging and auditing via Vector and Loki, complemented
  by visualization and alerting through Grafana, provide the means to perform
  ongoing reviews and monitoring at any organizationally defined frequency.
