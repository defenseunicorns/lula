control-acronym: CM-4(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization analyzes changes to the information system in a separate test
  environment before implementation in an operational environment, looking for
  security impacts due to flaws, weaknesses, incompatibility, or intentional
  malice.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Separate test environment in this context means an environment that is
  physically or logically isolated and distinct from the operational
  environment. The separation is sufficient to ensure that activities in the
  test environment do not impact activities in the operational environment, and
  information in the operational environment is not inadvertently transmitted to
  the test environment. Separate environments can be achieved by physical or
  logical means. If physically separate test environments are not used,
  organizations determine the strength of mechanism required when implementing
  logical separation (e.g., separation achieved through virtual machines).

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  security impact analysis for changes to the information system; configuration
  management plan; security impact analysis documentation; analysis tools and
  associated outputs information system design documentation; information system
  architecture and configuration documentation; change control records;
  information system audit records; documentation evidence of separate test and
  operational environments; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  conducting security impact analysis; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for security impact analysis;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing security impact analysis
  of changes].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and employs a policy to
  analyze changes to the information system in a separate test environment
  before installation in an operational environment, looking for security
  impacts due to flaws, weaknesses, incompatibility, or intentional malice. The
  organization must maintain records of analysis of changes to the information
  system.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated policy to analyze changes to the information system in a
  separate test environment before installation in an operational environment,
  looks for security impacts due to flaws, weaknesses, incompatibility, or
  intentional malice.

  2.) Records of analysis
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented policy for analyzing changes as well as
  records of analysis to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  analyzes changes to the information system in a separate test environment
  before installation in an operational environment, looking for security
  impacts due to flaws, weaknesses, incompatibility, or intentional malice.

test-results: UDS fully supports organizational analysis of changes within
  dedicated test environments prior to implementation in operational systems.
  Leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with OpenTofu and secure deployments
  using signed Zarf packages, UDS enables consistent and repeatable
  configuration testing in isolated, controlled environments that mirror
  production systems.
