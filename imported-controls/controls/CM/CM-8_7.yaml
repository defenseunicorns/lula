control-acronym: CM-8
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Develops and documents an inventory of information system components that:

  1. Accurately reflects the current information system;

  2. Includes all components within the authorization boundary of the
  information system;

  3. Is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting;
  and

  4. Includes [Assignment: organization-defined information deemed necessary to
  achieve effective information system component accountability]; and

  b. Reviews and updates the information system component inventory [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].

  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations may choose to implement centralized information system component
  inventories that include components from all organizational information
  systems. In such situations, organizations ensure that the resulting
  inventories include system-specific information required for proper component
  accountability (e.g., information system association, information system
  owner). Information deemed necessary for effective accountability of
  information system components includes, for example, hardware inventory
  specifications, software license information, software version numbers,
  component owners, and for networked components or devices, machine names and
  network addresses. Inventory specifications include, for example,
  manufacturer, device type, model, serial number, and physical location.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  information system component inventory; configuration management plan;
  security plan; information system inventory records; inventory reviews and
  update records; other relevant documents or records].

  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  information system component inventory; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system/network administrators].

  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for developing and documenting an
  inventory of information system components; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing the information system component inventory].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to review and update the information system component inventory at a minimum,
  annually.


  The organization must maintain an audit trail of review and update activity.


  DoD has defined the frequency as at a minimum, annually.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan (SSP)
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented process for reviews and updates as well as the audit trail of
  reviews and updates to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  reviews and updates the information system component inventory at a minimum,
  annually.

  DoD has defined the frequency as at a minimum, annually.
