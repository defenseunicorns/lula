control-acronym: CM-5(5)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Limits privileges to change information system components and
  system-related information within a production or operational environment; and

  (b) Reviews and reevaluates privileges [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  In many organizations, information systems support multiple core
  missions/business functions. Limiting privileges to change information system
  components with respect to operational systems is necessary because changes to
  a particular information system component may have far-reaching effects on
  mission/business processes supported by the system where the component
  resides. The complex, many-to-many relationships between systems and
  mission/business processes are in some cases, unknown to developers. Related
  control: AC-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  access restrictions for changes to the information system; configuration
  management plan; security plan; information system design documentation;
  information system architecture and configuration documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; user privilege
  reviews; user privilege recertifications; change control records; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing access restrictions
  to change; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing access
  restrictions for change].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to limit privileges to change system-related information within a production
  or operational environment.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation that defines a process to limit privileges to change
  system-related information within a production or operational environment
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed limits privileges to change system-related information
  within a production or operational environment.

remote-inheritance-instance: '-'
compliance-status: Compliant
test-results: UDS strictly limits privileges for making changes to
  system-related information within production and operational environments
  through a robust combination of identity management, role-based access
  control, and automated policy enforcement. Specifically, access and privilege
  assignments are centrally managed through Keycloak and enforced by
  AuthService, allowing only authorized personnel with designated administrative
  roles to modify system configurations or operational components. Pepr acts as
  the policy engine to enforce deployment and operational constraints within
  Kubernetes, preventing unauthorized configuration changes or deployments.
