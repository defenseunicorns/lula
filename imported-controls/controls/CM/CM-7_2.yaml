control-acronym: CM-7
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Configures the information system to provide only essential capabilities;
  and

  b. Prohibits or restricts the use of the following functions, ports,
  protocols, and/or services: [Assignment: organization-defined prohibited or
  restricted functions, ports, protocols, and/or services].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information systems can provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some
  of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to
  support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions).
  Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from
  single information system components, but doing so increases risk over
  limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible,
  organizations limit component functionality to a single function per device
  (e.g., email servers or web servers, but not both). Organizations review
  functions and services provided by information systems or individual
  components of information systems, to determine which functions and services
  are candidates for elimination (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, Instant
  Messaging, auto-execute, and file sharing). Organizations consider disabling
  unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols (e.g., Universal
  Serial Bus, File Transfer Protocol, and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) on
  information systems to prevent unauthorized connection of devices,
  unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling. Organizations
  can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention
  systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based intrusion
  detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions,
  ports, protocols, and services. Related controls: AC-6, CM-2, RA-5, SA-5,
  SC-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; configuration
  management plan; procedures addressing least functionality in the information
  system; security plan; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; security
  configuration checklists; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes prohibiting or restricting
  functions, ports, protocols, and/or services; automated mechanisms
  implementing restrictions or prohibition of functions, ports, protocols,
  and/or services].

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically Compliant
assessment-procedures: The organization being inspected/assessed is
  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the information system prohibited or restricted
  functions, ports, protocols, and/or services as IAW DoDI 8551.01.
