  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Establishes and documents configuration settings for information technology
  products employed within the information system using [Assignment:
  organization-defined security configuration checklists] that reflect the most
  restrictive mode consistent with operational requirements; 

  b. Implements the configuration settings; 

  c. Identifies, documents, and approves any deviations from established
  configuration settings for [Assignment: organization-defined information
  system components] based on [Assignment: organization-defined operational
  requirements]; and

  d. Monitors and controls changes to the configuration settings in accordance
  with organizational policies and procedures.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in
  hardware, software, or firmware components of the information system that
  affect the security posture and/or functionality of the system. Information
  technology products for which security-related configuration settings can be
  defined include, for example, mainframe computers, servers (e.g., database,
  electronic mail, authentication, web, proxy, file, domain name), workstations,
  input/output devices (e.g., scanners, copiers, and printers), network
  components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and data switches,
  wireless access points, network appliances, sensors), operating systems,
  middleware, and applications. Security-related parameters are those parameters
  impacting the security state of information systems including the parameters
  required to satisfy other security control requirements. Security-related
  parameters include, for example: (i) registry settings; (ii) account, file,
  directory permission settings; and (iii) settings for functions, ports,
  protocols, services, and remote connections. Organizations establish
  organization-wide configuration settings and subsequently derive specific
  settings for information systems. The established settings become part of the
  systems configuration baseline.

  Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration
  checklists, lockdown and hardening guides, security reference guides, security
  technical implementation guides) provide recognized, standardized, and
  established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for
  specific information technology platforms/products and instructions for
  configuring those information system components to meet operational
  requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety of
  organizations including, for example, information technology product
  developers, manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal
  agencies, and other organizations in the public and private sectors. Common
  secure configurations include the United States Government Configuration
  Baseline (USGCB) which affects the implementation of CM-6 and other controls
  such as AC-19 and CM-7. The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) and
  the defined standards within the protocol (e.g., Common Configuration
  Enumeration) provide an effective method to uniquely identify, track, and
  control configuration settings. OMB establishes federal policy on
  configuration requirements for federal information systems. Related controls:
  AC-19, CM-2, CM-3, CM-7, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  configuration settings for the information system; configuration management
  plan; security plan; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; security
  configuration checklists; evidence supporting approved deviations from
  established configuration settings; change control records; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing configuration
  settings; automated mechanisms that implement, monitor, and/or control
  information system configuration settings; automated mechanisms that identify
  and/or document deviations from established configuration settings].

  DoD security configuration or implementation guidance (e.g. STIGs, SRGs, NSA
  configuration guides, CTOs, DTMs etc.) meet the DoD requirement for ensuring
  security configuration checklists reflect the most restrictive mode consistent
  with operational requirements.

  DoD Components are automatically compliant with this CCI because they are
  covered by the DoD level security configuration or implementation guidance
  (e.g. STIGs, SRGs, NSA configuration guides, CTOs, DTMs etc.).
