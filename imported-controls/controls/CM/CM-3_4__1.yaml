control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization requires an information security representative to be a
  member of the [Assignment: organization-defined configuration change control
  element].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information security representatives can include, for example, senior agency
  information security officers, information system security officers, or
  information system security managers. Representation by personnel with
  information security expertise is important because changes to information
  system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of which may be
  security-relevant. Detecting such changes early in the process can help avoid
  unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security
  state of organizational information systems. The configuration change control
  element in this control enhancement reflects the change control elements
  defined by organizations in CM-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  information system configuration change control; configuration management
  plan; security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration change
  control responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for configuration change
  control].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed requires an information security
  representative to be a member of the configuration control board. DoD has
  defined the configuration change control element as the configuration control
  board.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Membership list of the CCB, which identifies an information security
  representative as a member
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the membership list of the organization's configuration
  control board to ensure an information security representative is a member of
  the organization's configuration control board.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The UDS technology stack
  provides tools to assist with configuration management, but the requirement
  for an information security representative to be a member of the
  organization-defined configuration change control element, such as a
  Configuration Control Board (CCB), is the responsibility of organization.)
