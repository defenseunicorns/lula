control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system prevents program execution in accordance with
  [Selection (one or more): [Assignment: organization-defined policies regarding
  software program usage and restrictions]; rules authorizing the terms and
  conditions of software program usage].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related controls: CM-8, PM-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  least functionality in the information system; configuration management plan;
  security plan; information system design documentation; specifications for
  preventing software program execution; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; change control records; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes preventing program execution on
  the information system; organizational processes for software program usage
  and restrictions; automated mechanisms preventing program execution on the
  information system; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  software program usage and restrictions].

cci: 1592
cci-definition: '001592: The organization defines the rules authorizing the
  terms and conditions of software program usage on the information system.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents their rules
  for approval of software program usage. For network capable software programs,
  the organization being inspected/assessed complies with DoDI 8551.01.

  DoD has determined that the rules authorizing the terms and conditions of
  software program usage on the information system are not appropriate to define
  at the Enterprise level.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Approved software list

  2.) Rules for approval of software program usage
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  rules as well as the software list to ensure that all network capable software
  programs are DoDI 8551.01 compliant and that the rules authorizing the use of
  all other programs are defined.

  DoD has determined that the rules authorizing the terms and conditions of
  software program usage on the information system are not appropriate to define
  at the Enterprise level.
