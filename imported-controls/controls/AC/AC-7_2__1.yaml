control-acronym: AC-7(2)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system purges/wipes information from [Assignment:
  organization-defined mobile devices] based on [Assignment:
  organization-defined purging/wiping requirements/techniques] after
  [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive, unsuccessful device
  logon attempts.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement applies only to mobile devices for which a logon
  occurs (e.g., personal digital assistants, smart phones, tablets). The logon
  is to the mobile device, not to any one account on the device. Therefore,
  successful logons to any accounts on mobile devices reset the unsuccessful
  logon count to zero. Organizations define information to be purged/wiped
  carefully in order to avoid over purging/wiping which may result in devices
  becoming unusable. Purging/wiping may be unnecessary if the information on the
  device is protected with sufficiently strong encryption mechanisms. Related
  controls: AC-19, MP-5, MP-6, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing
  unsuccessful login attempts on mobile devices; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; list of mobile devices to be purged/wiped after
  organization-defined consecutive, unsuccessful device logon attempts; list of
  purging/wiping requirements or techniques for mobile devices; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing access control policy
  for unsuccessful device logon attempts].

cci-definition: '002239: The organization defines the mobile devices that are to
  be purged/wiped by the information system after an organization-defined number
  of consecutive, unsuccessful device logon attempts.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the mobile
  devices that are to be purged/wiped by the information system after an
  organization-defined number of consecutive, unsuccessful device logon
  attempts. Mobile devices may be defined in terms of manufacturer and model
  name. DoD has determined the mobile devices are not appropriate to define at
  the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation that defines the mobile devices that are to
  be purged/wiped by the information system after an organization-defined number
  of consecutive, unsuccessful device logon attempts.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented mobile devices to ensure the organization
  being inspected/assessed defines the mobile devices that are to be
  purged/wiped by the information system after an organization-defined number of
  consecutive, unsuccessful device logon attempts. DoD has determined the mobile
  devices are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS Technology Stack. (UDS does not manage,
  control, or directly interface with mobile endpoint devices (e.g.,
  smartphones, tablets) or their associated device management functions, such as
  enforcing device lockout or wiping data after unsuccessful logon attempts.
  Mobile device management (MDM) controls, including device wipe after
  consecutive failed logins, typically require specialized endpoint management
  solutions external to the UDS.)
