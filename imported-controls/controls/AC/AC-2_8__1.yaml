control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system creates [Assignment: organization-defined information
  system accounts] dynamically.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Dynamic approaches for creating information system accounts (e.g., as
  implemented within service-oriented architectures) rely on establishing
  accounts (identities) at run time for entities that were previously unknown.
  Organizations plan for dynamic creation of information system accounts by
  establishing trust relationships and mechanisms with the appropriate
  authorities to validate related authorizations and privileges. Related
  control: AC-16.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system-generated list of
  information system accounts; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing account management
  functions].

cci-definition: '002138: The organization defines the information system
  accounts that can be dynamically created.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the
  information system accounts that can be dynamically created. DoD has
  determined the information system accounts are not appropriate to define at
  the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation which defines the information system
  accounts that can be dynamically created.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented information system accounts to ensure they
  have been defined. DoD has determined the information system accounts are not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

test-results: Dynamically created accounts through Keycloak, leverage its
  capabilities to generate short-lived or ephemeral credentials in line with
  non-human account best practices for Kubernetes and containerized
  environments. This process is further governed by Pepr, which enforces
  compliance requirements (e.g., restricting permissions or defining specific
  conditions for account creation) at the Kubernetes level. Within the service
  mesh, Istio ensures secure traffic management for any dynamically provisioned
  identities, while AuthService handles the authorization flow in tandem with
  Keycloak. Relevant telemetry from Prometheus, Metrics Server, Grafana, as well
  as logs collected via Vector and aggregated by Loki, provide continuous
  oversight of account usage and support rapid detection of anomalies.
