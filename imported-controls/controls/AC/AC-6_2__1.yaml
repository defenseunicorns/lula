control-acronym: AC-6(2)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization requires that users of information system accounts, or roles,
  with access to [Assignment: organization-defined security functions or
  security-relevant information], use non-privileged accounts or roles, when
  accessing nonsecurity functions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement limits exposure when operating from within privileged
  accounts or roles. The inclusion of roles addresses situations where
  organizations implement access control policies such as role-based access
  control and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in
  the change of access authorizations for both the user and all processes acting
  on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged
  and non-privileged account. Related control: PL-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing least
  privilege; list of system-generated security functions or security-relevant
  information assigned to information system accounts or roles; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  defining least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing least privilege
  functions].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to require that users of information system accounts or roles, with access to
  any privileged security functions or security-relevant information, use
  non-privileged accounts, or roles, when accessing nonsecurity functions. DoD
  has defined the security functions and security-relevant information as any
  privileged security functions or security-relevant information.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated access control policy

  2.) Signed and dated system security plan (SSP)

  3.) Provide signed and dated documentation that defines the process to require
  that users of information system accounts or roles, with access to any
  privileged security functions or security-relevant information, use
  non-privileged accounts, or roles, when accessing non-security functions.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed requires that users of information system accounts or
  roles, with access to any privileged security functions or security-relevant
  information, use non-privileged accounts, or roles, when accessing nonsecurity
  functions. DoD has defined the security functions and security-relevant
  information as any privileged security functions or security-relevant
  information.

test-results: 'In UDS, administrators typically have a dedicated admin account
  in Keycloak (with admin roles) separate from any normal user account they
  might use for day-to-day usage of applications. The stack doesnât enforce
  this separation on its own, but it supports it by allowing multiple accounts
  per person or multiple roles that can be toggled. For example, an admin might
  have an unprivileged account for general use and a privileged account for
  administration UDSâs access controls can ensure the admin only accesses
  critical functions with the proper account. While the implementation (having
  separate accounts) is a policy decision, UDS fully accommodates it by
  segregating permissions by account and role, thereby aligning with the intent
  of limiting use of privileged credentials to when they are needed.'
