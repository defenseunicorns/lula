control-acronym: AC-7
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system:

  a. Enforces a limit of [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive
  invalid logon attempts by a user during a [Assignment: organization-defined
  time period]; and

  b. Automatically [Selection: locks the account/node for an [Assignment:
  organization-defined time period]; locks the account/node until released by an
  administrator; delays next logon prompt according to [Assignment:
  organization-defined delay algorithm]] when the maximum number of unsuccessful
  attempts is exceeded.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies regardless of whether the logon occurs via a local or
  network connection. Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic
  lockouts initiated by information systems are usually temporary and
  automatically release after a predetermined time period established by
  organizations. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may choose to
  employ different algorithms for different information system components based
  on the capabilities of those components. Responses to unsuccessful logon
  attempts may be implemented at both the operating system and the application
  levels. Related controls: AC-2, AC-9, AC-14, IA-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing
  unsuccessful logon attempts; security plan; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system developers; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing access control policy
  for unsuccessful logon attempts].

  DoD has defined the time period as until released by an administrator.

  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the time period as until released by an administrator.
