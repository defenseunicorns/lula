  Description:

  The information system creates [Assignment: organization-defined information
  system accounts] dynamically.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Dynamic approaches for creating information system accounts (e.g., as
  implemented within service-oriented architectures) rely on establishing
  accounts (identities) at run time for entities that were previously unknown.
  Organizations plan for dynamic creation of information system accounts by
  establishing trust relationships and mechanisms with the appropriate
  authorities to validate related authorizations and privileges. Related
  control: AC-16.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system-generated list of
  information system accounts; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing account management
  functions].

cci-definition: '002139: The information system creates organization-defined
  information system accounts dynamically.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  dynamically create information system accounts defined in AC-2 (8), CCI 2138.
  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 2139.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation which defines the process for creating
  information system account dynamically.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to dynamically create
  information system accounts defined in AC-2 (8), CCI 2138. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization
  conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that
  the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the information
  system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI
  2139.

test-results: Dynamically created accounts through Keycloak, leverage its
  capabilities to generate short-lived or ephemeral credentials in line with
  non-human account best practices for Kubernetes and containerized
  environments. This process is further governed by Pepr, which enforces
  compliance requirements (e.g., restricting permissions or defining specific
  conditions for account creation) at the Kubernetes level. Within the service
  mesh, Istio ensures secure traffic management for any dynamically provisioned
  identities, while AuthService handles the authorization flow in tandem with
  Keycloak. Relevant telemetry from Prometheus, Metrics Server, Grafana, as well
  as logs collected via Vector and aggregated by Loki, provide continuous
  oversight of account usage and support rapid detection of anomalies.
