  Description:

  The organization restricts privileged accounts on the information system to
  [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically described as
  system administrator for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating
  systems. Restricting privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles
  prevents day-to-day users from having access to privileged
  information/functions. Organizations may differentiate in the application of
  this control enhancement between allowed privileges for local accounts and for
  domain accounts provided organizations retain the ability to control
  information system configurations for key security parameters and as otherwise
  necessary to sufficiently mitigate risk. Related control: CM-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing least
  privilege; list of system-generated privileged accounts; list of system
  administration personnel; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  defining least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing least privilege
  functions].

  The organization being inspected/assessed implements a process to only provide
  privileged accounts on the information system to personnel or roles defined in
  AC-6 (5), CCI 2226.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated access control policy

  2.) Signed and dated system security plan (SSP)

  3.) Copy of privileged user agreement

  4.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines a sampling of information system access authorizations to
  ensure the organization being inspected/assessed implements a process to only
  provide privileged accounts on the information system to personnel or roles
  defined in AC-6 (5), CCI 2226.

test-results: UDS provides robust technical capabilities to restrict privileged
  accounts through its centralized identity management solution (Keycloak) and
  Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Privileged roles such as system
  administrators, security managers, or auditors can be explicitly defined and
  assigned granular permissions within Keycloak and Kubernetes, ensuring
  privileged access is strictly controlled.
