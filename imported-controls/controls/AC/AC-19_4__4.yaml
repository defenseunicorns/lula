  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Prohibits the use of unclassified mobile devices in facilities containing
  information systems processing, storing, or transmitting classified
  information unless specifically permitted by the authorizing official; and

  (b) Enforces the following restrictions on individuals permitted by the
  authorizing official to use unclassified mobile devices in facilities
  containing information systems processing, storing, or transmitting classified
  information:

  (1) Connection of unclassified mobile devices to classified information
  systems is prohibited;

  (2) Connection of unclassified mobile devices to unclassified information
  systems requires approval from the authorizing official;

  (3) Use of internal or external modems or wireless interfaces within the
  unclassified mobile devices is prohibited; and

  (4) Unclassified mobile devices and the information stored on those devices
  are subject to random reviews and inspections by [Assignment:
  organization-defined security officials], and if classified information is
  found, the incident handling policy is followed.

  (c) Restricts the connection of classified mobile devices to classified
  information systems in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined
  security policies].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related controls: CA-6, IR-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; incident handling policy;
  procedures addressing access control for mobile devices; information system
  design documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; evidentiary documentation for random inspections and reviews of
  mobile devices; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel responsible for random
  reviews/inspections of mobile devices; organizational personnel using mobile
  devices in facilities containing information systems processing, storing, or
  transmitting classified information; organizational personnel with incident
  response responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms prohibiting the use of internal or
  external modems or wireless interfaces with mobile devices].

  modems or wireless interfaces within unclassified mobile devices in facilities
  containing information systems processing, storing, or transmitting classified
  information.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to prohibit use of internal or external modems or wireless interfaces within
  unclassified mobile devices in facilities containing information systems
  processing, storing, or transmitting classified information.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan (SSP) and/or standard operating
  procedures (SOP) that describes how the site prohibits use of internal or
  external modems or wireless interfaces within unclassified mobile devices in
  facilities containing information systems processing, storing, or transmitting
  classified information.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed prohibits use of internal or external modems or wireless
  interfaces within unclassified mobile devices in facilities containing
  information systems processing, storing, or transmitting classified
  information.
