control-acronym: AC-6(8)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system prevents [Assignment: organization-defined software]
  from executing at higher privilege levels than users executing the software.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  In certain situations, software applications/programs need to execute with
  elevated privileges to perform required functions. However, if the privileges
  required for execution are at a higher level than the privileges assigned to
  organizational users invoking such applications/programs, those users are
  indirectly provided with greater privileges than assigned by organizations.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing least
  privilege; list of software that should not execute at higher privilege levels
  than users executing software; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  defining least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing least privilege
  functions for software execution].

  DoD has defined the software as any software except software explicitly

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically compliant
assessment-procedures: The organization being inspected/assessed is
  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the software as any software except software explicitly
  documented.
