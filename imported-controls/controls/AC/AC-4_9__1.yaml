  Description:

  The information system enforces the use of human reviews for [Assignment:
  organization-defined information flows] under the following conditions:
  [Assignment: organization-defined conditions].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations define security policy filters for all situations where
  automated flow control decisions are possible. When a fully automated flow
  control decision is not possible, then a human review may be employed in lieu
  of, or as a complement to, automated security policy filtering. Human reviews
  may also be employed as deemed necessary by organizations.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; information flow control
  policies; procedures addressing information flow enforcement; information
  system design documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; records of human reviews regarding information
  flows; list of conditions requiring human reviews for information flows;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with information flow enforcement responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms enforcing the use of human reviews].

  which the information system will enforce the use of human reviews under

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the
  information flows for which the information system will enforce the use of
  human reviews under organization-defined conditions. DoD has determined the
  information flows are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation that defines the information flows for
  which the information system will enforce the use of human reviews under
  organization-defined conditions.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented information flows to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed defines the information flows for which
  the information system will enforce the use of human reviews under
  organization-defined conditions. DoD has determined the information flows are
  not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

remote-inheritance-instance: '-'
test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack and most likely not
  applicable to environment. (Most organization do not deem human reviews of
  automated flow control decisions.)
