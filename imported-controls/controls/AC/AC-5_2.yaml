control-acronym: AC-5
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Separates [Assignment: organization-defined duties of individuals];

  b. Documents separation of duties of individuals; and

  c. Defines information system access authorizations to support separation of
  duties.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized
  privileges and helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without
  collusion. Separation of duties includes, for example: (i) dividing mission
  functions and information system support functions among different individuals
  and/or roles; (ii) conducting information system support functions with
  different individuals (e.g., system management, programming, configuration
  management, quality assurance and testing, and network security); and (iii)
  ensuring security personnel administering access control functions do not also
  administer audit functions. Related controls: AC-3, AC-6, PE-3, PE-4, PS-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing divisions
  of responsibility and separation of duties; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; list of divisions of responsibility and
  separation of duties; information system access authorizations; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  defining appropriate divisions of responsibility and separation of duties;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing separation of duties
  policy].

cci-definition: '002219: The organization defines the duties of individuals that

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the duties of
  individuals that are to be separated. DoD has determined the duties are not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated access control policy

  2.) Job description documentation

  3.) Signed and dated documentation that lists the duties of individuals that
  are to be separated
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented duties to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed defines the duties of individuals that are to be separated.
  DoD has determined the duties are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise
  level.

test-results: UDS supports strong enforcement of separation of duties through
  comprehensive Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC). Keycloak provides centralized
  identity management, enabling administrators to clearly define and assign
  distinct roles (e.g., system administrator versus auditor) to prevent
  unrestricted control by any single individual. Kubernetes RBAC complements
  this by further isolating responsibilities, allowing precise segregation of
  duties such as application deployment, infrastructure management, and security
  configuration among distinct users and service accounts. Additionally, Istio
  Service Mesh gateways and authorization policies can be configured to strictly
  separate administrative management functions from general user or operational
  traffic. Collectively, these technical mechanisms enable robust enforcement of
  duty separation, ensuring critical functions require collaboration or are
  restricted to specifically authorized roles.
