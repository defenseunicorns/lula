control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization [Selection: restricts; prohibits] the use of
  organization-controlled portable storage devices by authorized individuals on
  external information systems.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Limits on the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices in
  external information systems include, for example, complete prohibition of the
  use of such devices or restrictions on how the devices may be used and under
  what conditions the devices may be used.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing the use of
  external information systems; security plan; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; information system connection or
  processing agreements; account management documents; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  restricting or prohibiting use of organization-controlled storage devices on
  external information systems; system/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing restrictions on use of
  portable storage devices].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to restrict or policy to prohibit the use of organization-controlled portable
  storage devices by authorized individuals on external information systems.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security (SSP)

  2.) Signed and dated MOU/MOA with any external information systems
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process or policy to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed restricts or prohibits the use of
  organization-controlled portable storage devices by authorized individuals on
  external information systems.

  using UDS from personal or external devices, or terms of use for external
  system connections, must be handled by policy. UDS does not inherently enforce
  device-specific rules beyond standard network access control. The expectation
  is that the hosting environmentâs policies prevent unauthorized external
  system use.)'
