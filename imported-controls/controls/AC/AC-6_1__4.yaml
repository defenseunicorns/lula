control-acronym: AC-6(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization explicitly authorizes access to [Assignment:
  organization-defined security functions (deployed in hardware, software, and
  firmware) and security-relevant information].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Security functions include, for example, establishing system accounts,
  configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting
  events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters.
  Security-relevant information includes, for example, filtering rules for
  routers/firewalls, cryptographic key management information, configuration
  parameters for security services, and access control lists. Explicitly
  authorized personnel include, for example, security administrators, system and
  network administrators, system security officers, system maintenance
  personnel, system programmers, and other privileged users. Related controls:
  AC-17, AC-18, AC-19.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing least
  privilege; list of security functions (deployed in hardware, software, and
  firmware) and security-relevant information for which access must be
  explicitly authorized; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  defining least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing least privilege
  functions].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to explicitly authorize access to all security-relevant information not
  publicly available. Explicit authorization can be in the form of an acceptable
  use policy signed by the user at the time of access being granted. DoD has
  defined the security-relevant information as all security-relevant information
  not publicly available.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated access control policy

  2.) Signed and dated system security plan (SSP)

  3.) Signed and dated documentation that defines the process to explicitly
  authorize access to all security-relevant information not publicly available
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed explicitly authorizes access to all security-relevant
  information not publicly available. DoD has defined the security-relevant
  information as all security-relevant information not publicly available.

test-results: 'The UDS stack enforces this by requiring that any change to
  permissions (like adding a user to an admin role in Keycloak or granting a
  cluster role in Kubernetes) be performed by an account that already has
  administrative rights. This means privileged functions â e.g., managing
  security settings, creating accounts, modifying critical configurations â
  are inaccessible to general users. The stackâs design (central admin console
  for Keycloak, controlled cluster config via IaC) ensures that granting or
  adjusting privileges is itself a restricted action.'
