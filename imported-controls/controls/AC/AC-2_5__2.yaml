  organization-defined time-period of expected inactivity or description of when

  Related control: SC-23.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; security plan; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  security violation reports; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; users that must comply with inactivity
  logout policy].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents in the user policies that
  users are required to log out at the end of the users standard work period
  unless otherwise defined in formal organizational policy and IAW conditions
  defined in AC-2 (5) CCI 2133. DoD has defined the time period as at the end of
  the users standard work period unless otherwise defined in formal
  organizational policy.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation that defines the other organization-defined
  requirement when users are supposed to log out

  2.) Audit trail
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the user policies to ensure that users are required to
  log out at the end of the users standard work period unless otherwise defined
  in formal organizational policy and IAW conditions defined in AC-2 (5) CCI
  2133. DoD has defined the time period as at the end of the users standard work

test-results: 'Keycloak fully supports session timeouts through configurable
  settings that manage the lifecycle of sessions. It allows you to set an SSO
  session idle timeout, which determines how long a session can remain inactive
  before being automatically terminated, as well as an SSO session max timeout,
  which imposes an absolute limit on the session''s duration regardless of
  activity. Additionally, for offline sessionsâsuch as those used with
  "remember me" functionality separate configurations exist to manage both
  idle timeouts and maximum lifespans. These settings are accessible and
  adjustable through the Keycloak admin console under the realm''s token
  settings, enabling you to tailor session management to meet specific security
  and user experience requirements.'
