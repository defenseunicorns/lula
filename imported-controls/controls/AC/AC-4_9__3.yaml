control-acronym: AC-4(9)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system enforces the use of human reviews for [Assignment:
  organization-defined information flows] under the following conditions:
  [Assignment: organization-defined conditions].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations define security policy filters for all situations where
  automated flow control decisions are possible. When a fully automated flow
  control decision is not possible, then a human review may be employed in lieu
  of, or as a complement to, automated security policy filtering. Human reviews
  may also be employed as deemed necessary by organizations.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; information flow control
  policies; procedures addressing information flow enforcement; information
  system design documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; records of human reviews regarding information
  flows; list of conditions requiring human reviews for information flows;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with information flow enforcement responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms enforcing the use of human reviews].

cci-definition: '002198: The information system enforces the use of human
  reviews for organization-defined information flows under organization-defined
  conditions.'
implementation-guidance: The organization being inspected/assessed configures
  the information system to enforce the use of human reviews for information
  flows defined in AC-4 (9), CCI 2196 under conditions defined in AC-4 (9), CCI
  2197. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs,
  the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG
  guidance that pertains to CCI 2198.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to enforce the use of
  human reviews for information flows defined in AC-4 (9), CCI 2196 under
  conditions defined in AC-4 (9), CCI 2197. For information system components
  that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 2198.
