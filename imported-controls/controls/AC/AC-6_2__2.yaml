control-acronym: AC-6(2)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization requires that users of information system accounts, or roles,
  with access to [Assignment: organization-defined security functions or
  security-relevant information], use non-privileged accounts or roles, when
  accessing nonsecurity functions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement limits exposure when operating from within privileged
  accounts or roles. The inclusion of roles addresses situations where
  organizations implement access control policies such as role-based access
  control and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in
  the change of access authorizations for both the user and all processes acting
  on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged
  and non-privileged account. Related control: PL-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing least
  privilege; list of system-generated security functions or security-relevant
  information assigned to information system accounts or roles; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  defining least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing least privilege
  functions].

  DoD has defined the security functions and security-relevant information as
  any privileged security functions or security-relevant information.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically compliant
assessment-procedures: The organization being inspected/assessed is
  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the security functions and security-relevant
  information as any privileged security functions or security-relevant
  information.
