  Description:

  The information system implements the following dynamic privilege management
  capabilities: [Assignment: organization-defined list of dynamic privilege
  management capabilities].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  In contrast to conventional access control approaches which employ static
  information system accounts and predefined sets of user privileges, dynamic
  access control approaches (e.g., service-oriented architectures) rely on run
  time access control decisions facilitated by dynamic privilege management.
  While user identities may remain relatively constant over time, user
  privileges may change more frequently based on ongoing mission/business
  requirements and operational needs of organizations. Dynamic privilege
  management can include, for example, the immediate revocation of privileges
  from users, as opposed to requiring that users terminate and restart their
  sessions to reflect any changes in privileges. Dynamic privilege management
  can also refer to mechanisms that change the privileges of users based on
  dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. This type of
  privilege management includes, for example, automatic adjustments of
  privileges if users are operating out of their normal work times, or if
  information systems are under duress or in emergency maintenance situations.
  This control enhancement also includes the ancillary effects of privilege
  changes, for example, the potential changes to encryption keys used for
  communications. Dynamic privilege management can support requirements for
  information system resiliency. Related control: AC-16.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system-generated list of
  dynamic privilege management capabilities; information system audit records;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Information system implementing dynamic privilege
  management capabilities].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  implement the list of dynamic privilege management capabilities defined in
  AC-2 (6), CCI 2134. For information system components that have applicable
  STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the
  STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 2135.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation defines the process for implementing the
  organization-defined list of dynamic privilege management capabilities.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to implement the list of
  dynamic privilege management capabilities defined in AC-2 (6), CCI 2134. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 2135.

test-results: 'Evidence of dynamic privilege management capabilities being
  implemented would be found in several areas depending on the type configured.
  In session management and token revocation, the Admin Console under Sessions
  would show active sessions with options for revocation or forced
  re-authentication, while the Admin REST API
  (/auth/admin/realms/{realm}/sessions) could provide further control over
  session updates. Revocation policies
  (/auth/admin/realms/{realm}/clients/{client_id}/revocation) would indicate
  whether privilege changes apply automatically. Under Authorization Services &
  Dynamic Policies, the Admin Consoleâs Authorization section would contain
  policies that dynamically adjust user privileges based on factors such as time
  of access or request context. In token introspection and real-time evaluation,
  the Admin REST API
  (/auth/realms/{realm}/protocol/openid-connect/token/introspect) could confirm
  whether token permissions are dynamically updated, and checking user
  attribute-based policies would help determine if tokens contain dynamic
  claims. Event listeners and custom extensions in the Admin Consoleâs Events
  section could reveal logs related to privilege updates, while custom event
  listeners if implemented would be found in standalone.xml or keycloak.conf. In
  conditional authentication and step-up policies, the Authentication Flows
  section in the Admin Console would show if privilege adjustments occur based
  on contextual risk factors.'
