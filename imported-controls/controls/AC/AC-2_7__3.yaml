  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Establishes and administers privileged user accounts in accordance with a
  role-based access scheme that organizes allowed information system access and
  privileges into roles;

  (b) Monitors privileged role assignments; and

  (c) Takes [Assignment: organization-defined actions] when privileged role
  assignments are no longer appropriate.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals that
  allow those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that
  ordinary users are not authorized to perform. These privileged roles include,
  for example, key management, account management, network and system
  administration, database administration, and web administration.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; information
  system-generated list of privileged user accounts and associated role; records
  of actions taken when privileged role assignments are no longer appropriate;
  information system audit records; audit tracking and monitoring reports;
  information system monitoring records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing account management
  functions; automated mechanisms monitoring privileged role assignments].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed implements a process to monitor
  privileged role assignments. The organization must maintain an audit trail of
  monitoring.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System Security Plan (SSP), referencing section which
  defines the process for monitoring and reviewing privileged role assignments.

  2.) Audit trail of monitoring.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the audit trail of monitoring to ensure the organization
  being inspected/assessed monitors privileged role assignments.

test-results: Keycloak monitors privileged role assignments through its built-in
  event listeners and audit logging mechanisms. When a privileged role is
  assigned, Keycloak generates an admin event that includes details such as the
  realm, client, user, and assigned role. These events are stored in the
  database and can be sent to external logging systems via the Event Listener
  SPI, which supports integrations with Loki, syslog, or custom audit handlers.
  By configuring Loki as an external logging backend, Keycloak can stream role
  assignment events in real-time, enabling administrators to query, visualize,
  and set up alerts for high-privilege role changes using Grafana.
  Administrators can configure policies using fine-grained authorization with
  Keycloak's Authorization Services to enforce role assignment approvals,
  implement review workflows, or trigger alerts for high-privilege role changes.
