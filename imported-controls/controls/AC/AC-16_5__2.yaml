control-acronym: AC-16(5)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system displays security attributes in human-readable form on
  each object that the system transmits to output devices to identify
  [Assignment: organization-identified special dissemination, handling, or
  distribution instructions] using [Assignment: organization-identified
  human-readable, standard naming conventions].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information system outputs include, for example, pages, screens, or
  equivalent. Information system output devices include, for example, printers
  and video displays on computer workstations, notebook computers, and personal
  digital assistants.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing display of
  security attributes in human-readable form; special dissemination, handling,
  or distribution instructions; types of human-readable, standard naming
  conventions; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; information system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: System output devices displaying security attributes in
  human-readable form on each object].

  DoD has defined the instructions as for instructions relating to
  classification, special dissemination, handling, or distribution instructions
  IAW DODI 5200.1R; for SCI and SAP, IAW Controlled Access Program Coordination
  Office (CAPCO) register. For all other instructions, not appropriate to define
  at the Enterprise level. The organization being inspected/assessed defines and
  documents special dissemination, handling, or distribution instructions not
  relating to classification, for identifying security attributes on output.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation that identifies special dissemination,
  handling, or distribution instructions for identifying security attributes on
  output.
assessment-procedures: DoD has defined the instructions as for instructions
  relating to classification, special dissemination, handling, or distribution
  instructions IAW DODI 5200.1R; for SCI and SAP, IAW Controlled Access Program
  Coordination Office (CAPCO) register. For all other instructions, not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level. The organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment obtains and examines the documented instructions not
  relating to classification to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  identifies special dissemination, handling, or distribution instructions for
  identifying security attributes on output.

test-results: 'Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS inherently supports
  the association and management of security attributes for stored, processed,
  and transmitted information through integrated infrastructure capabilities.
  However, explicitly displaying security attributes in human-readable form such
  as special dissemination, handling, or distribution instructionsâon output
  devices is typically managed at the application or client endpoint layer,
  rather than within the UDS platform itself.)'
