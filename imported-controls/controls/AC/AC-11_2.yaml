control-acronym: AC-11
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system:

  a. Prevents further access to the system by initiating a session lock after
  [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of inactivity or upon receiving
  a request from a user; and

  b. Retains the session lock until the user reestablishes access using
  established identification and authentication procedures.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Session locks are temporary actions taken when users stop work and move away
  from the immediate vicinity of information systems but do not want to log out
  because of the temporary nature of their absences. Session locks are
  implemented where session activities can be determined. This is typically at
  the operating system level, but can also be at the application level. Session
  locks are not an acceptable substitute for logging out of information systems,
  for example, if organizations require users to log out at the end of workdays.
  Related control: AC-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing session
  lock; procedures addressing identification and authentication; information
  system design documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing access control policy
  for session lock].
