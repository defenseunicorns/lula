control-acronym: AC-22
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Designates individuals authorized to post information onto a publicly
  accessible information system;

  b. Trains authorized individuals to ensure that publicly accessible
  information does not contain nonpublic information;

  c. Reviews the proposed content of information prior to posting onto the
  publicly accessible information system to ensure that nonpublic information is
  not included; and

  d. Reviews the content on the publicly accessible information system for
  nonpublic information [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and removes
  such information, if discovered.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  In accordance with federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
  regulations, standards, and/or guidance, the general public is not authorized
  access to nonpublic information (e.g., information protected under the Privacy
  Act and proprietary information). This control addresses information systems
  that are controlled by the organization and accessible to the general public,
  typically without identification or authentication. The posting of information
  on non-organization information systems is covered by organizational policy.
  Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, AT-2, AT-3, AU-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing publicly
  accessible content; list of users authorized to post publicly accessible
  content on organizational information systems; training materials and/or
  records; records of publicly accessible information reviews; records of
  response to nonpublic information on public websites; system audit logs;
  security awareness training records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  managing publicly accessible information posted on organizational information
  systems; organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing management of publicly
  accessible content].
