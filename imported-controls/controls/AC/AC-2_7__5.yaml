  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Establishes and administers privileged user accounts in accordance with a
  role-based access scheme that organizes allowed information system access and
  privileges into roles;

  (b) Monitors privileged role assignments; and

  (c) Takes [Assignment: organization-defined actions] when privileged role
  assignments are no longer appropriate.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals that
  allow those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that
  ordinary users are not authorized to perform. These privileged roles include,
  for example, key management, account management, network and system
  administration, database administration, and web administration.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; information
  system-generated list of privileged user accounts and associated role; records
  of actions taken when privileged role assignments are no longer appropriate;
  information system audit records; audit tracking and monitoring reports;
  information system monitoring records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing account management
  functions; automated mechanisms monitoring privileged role assignments].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to disable (or revoke) the privileged user account when privileged role
  assignments are no longer appropriate. The organization must maintain an audit
  trail of the actions taken. DoD has defined the actions as disables (or
  revokes) privileged user account.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation of a process for disabling/revoking
  privileged user accounts.

  2.) Audit trail of disabling/revoking privileged user accounts.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented process as well as the audit trail of actions taken to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed disables (or revokes) the privileged
  user account when privileged role assignments are no longer appropriate.

  DoD has defined the actions as disables (or revokes) privileged user account.

compliance-status: Compliant
test-results: 'Keycloak can implement a systematic procedure for disabling or
  revoking privileged user accounts by leveraging its built-in role-based access
  control (RBAC) and auditing capabilities. Administrators can regularly review
  privileged roles and, when the assignments are no longer appropriate, remove
  or disable the associated account through the Keycloak Admin Console or API.
  By disabling an account (or removing the role assignment) rather than simply
  deleting it, organizations preserve the accountâs historical data for audit
  or investigative purposes, satisfying DoD requirements. Every administrative
  action in Keycloak, such as disabling accounts or revoking roles, can be
  logged through its auditing and event features, ensuring an audit trail is
  maintained. This log data includes the timestamp of the action, the
  administrator or service principal responsible, and the nature of the change,
  providing the necessary evidence for compliance and governance reviews.'
