control-acronym: AC-11
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system:

  a. Prevents further access to the system by initiating a session lock after
  [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of inactivity or upon receiving
  a request from a user; and

  b. Retains the session lock until the user reestablishes access using
  established identification and authentication procedures.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Session locks are temporary actions taken when users stop work and move away
  from the immediate vicinity of information systems but do not want to log out
  because of the temporary nature of their absences. Session locks are
  implemented where session activities can be determined. This is typically at
  the operating system level, but can also be at the application level. Session
  locks are not an acceptable substitute for logging out of information systems,
  for example, if organizations require users to log out at the end of workdays.
  Related control: AC-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing session
  lock; procedures addressing identification and authentication; information
  system design documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing access control policy
  for session lock].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  provide the capability for users to directly initiate session lock mechanisms.
  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 58.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks

  2.) Documentation that shows the system is configured to provide the
  capability for users to directly initiate session lock mechanisms
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to provide the capability
  for users to directly initiate session lock mechanisms. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 58.

test-results: Session lock (e.g., auto-locking an interactive session after
  inactivity) in a web context translates to session timeouts. Keycloak tokens
  and sessions have configurable timeouts for inactivity and maximum session
  lifespan. For example, if a user is logged into an application via UDS and is
  idle, their session token can expire after a set idle period, forcing
  re-authentication.
