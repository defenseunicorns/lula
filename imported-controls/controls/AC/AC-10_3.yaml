control-acronym: AC-10
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system limits the number of concurrent sessions for each
  [Assignment: organization-defined account and/or account type] to [Assignment:
  organization-defined number].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations may define the maximum number of concurrent sessions for
  information system accounts globally, by account type (e.g., privileged user,
  non-privileged user, domain, specific application), by account, or a
  combination. For example, organizations may limit the number of concurrent
  sessions for system administrators or individuals working in particularly
  sensitive domains or mission-critical applications. This control addresses
  concurrent sessions for information system accounts and does not address
  concurrent sessions by single users via multiple system accounts.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing concurrent
  session control; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing access control policy
  for concurrent session control].

  level. DoD has defined the account types and/or accounts as all account types
  and/or accounts.
