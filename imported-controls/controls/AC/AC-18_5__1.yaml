control-acronym: AC-18(5)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization selects radio antennas and calibrates transmission power
  levels to reduce the probability that usable signals can be received outside
  of organization-controlled boundaries.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Actions that may be taken by organizations to limit unauthorized use of
  wireless communications outside of organization-controlled boundaries include,
  for example: (i) reducing the power of wireless transmissions so that the
  transmissions are less likely to emit a signal that can be used by adversaries
  outside of the physical perimeters of organizations; (ii) employing measures
  such as TEMPEST to control wireless emanations; and (iii) using
  directional/beam forming antennas that reduce the likelihood that unintended
  receivers will be able to intercept signals. Prior to taking such actions,
  organizations can conduct periodic wireless surveys to understand the radio
  frequency profile of organizational information systems as well as other
  systems that may be operating in the area. Related control: PE-19.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing wireless
  implementation and usage (including restrictions); information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Wireless access capability protecting usable signals from
  unauthorized access outside organization-controlled boundaries].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to select radio antennas and calibrate transmission power levels to reduce the
  probability that usable signals can be received outside of
  organization-controlled boundaries.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated access control policy and radio antenna installation
  guide that describes how the site selects radio antennas and calibrates
  transmission power levels to reduce the probability that usable signals can be
  received outside of organization-controlled boundaries.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documentation from radio antenna installation to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed selects radio antennas
  and calibrates transmission power levels to reduce the probability that usable
  signals can be received outside of organization-controlled boundaries.
inherited: Local
remote-inheritance-instance: '-'
test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS does not inherently
  control the use of wireless networking. Any wireless access control would be
  handled by the underlying network infrastructure, not by UDS itself i.e.
  wireless network adapters and bluetooth would be enabled/disabled at the
  operating system.)
