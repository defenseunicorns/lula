control-acronym: AC-4(4)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system prevents encrypted information from bypassing
  content-checking mechanisms by [Selection (one or more): decrypting the
  information; blocking the flow of the encrypted information; terminating
  communications sessions attempting to pass encrypted information; [Assignment:
  organization-defined procedure or method]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related control: SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; information flow control
  policies; procedures addressing information flow enforcement; information
  system design documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing information flow
  enforcement policy].

cci-definition: '000028: The information system prevents encrypted information
  from bypassing content-checking mechanisms by employing organization-defined
  procedures or methods.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  prevent encrypted information from bypassing content-checking mechanisms by
  employing procedures or methods defined in AC-4 (4), CCI 2193. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  28.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation that ensures that the system is configured
  to prevent encrypted information from bypassing content-checking mechanisms,
  as defined in CCI 2193.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to prevent encrypted
  information from bypassing content-checking mechanisms by employing procedures
  or methods defined in AC-4 (4), CCI 2193. For information system components
  that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 28.
