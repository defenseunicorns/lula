control-acronym: AC-17(3)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system routes all remote accesses through [Assignment:
  organization-defined number] managed network access control points.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Limiting the number of access control points for remote accesses reduces the
  attack surface for organizations. Organizations consider the Trusted Internet
  Connections (TIC) initiative requirements for external network connections.
  Related control: SC-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing remote
  access to the information system; information system design documentation;
  list of all managed network access control points; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; information system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms routing all remote accesses through
  managed network access control points].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  route all remote accesses through the number of managed network access control
  points defined in AC-17 (3), CCI 2315. For information system components that
  have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 69.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks

  2.) Signed and dated network flow chart, network diagram, hardware inventory
  sheet and/or other document that will list all remote access points.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to route all remote
  accesses through the number of managed network access control points defined
  in AC-17 (3), CCI 2315. For information system components that have applicable
  STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates
  the components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 69.
