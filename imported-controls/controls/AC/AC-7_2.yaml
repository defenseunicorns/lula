control-acronym: AC-7
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system:

  a. Enforces a limit of [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive
  invalid logon attempts by a user during a [Assignment: organization-defined
  time period]; and

  b. Automatically [Selection: locks the account/node for an [Assignment:
  organization-defined time period]; locks the account/node until released by an
  administrator; delays next logon prompt according to [Assignment:
  organization-defined delay algorithm]] when the maximum number of unsuccessful
  attempts is exceeded.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies regardless of whether the logon occurs via a local or
  network connection. Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic
  lockouts initiated by information systems are usually temporary and
  automatically release after a predetermined time period established by
  organizations. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may choose to
  employ different algorithms for different information system components based
  on the capabilities of those components. Responses to unsuccessful logon
  attempts may be implemented at both the operating system and the application
  levels. Related controls: AC-2, AC-9, AC-14, IA-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing
  unsuccessful logon attempts; security plan; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system developers; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing access control policy
  for unsuccessful logon attempts].

  organization-defined limit of consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user
  during the organization-defined time period.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  limit invalid logon attempts by a user to three attempts during a 15 minute
  time period. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG
  guidance that pertains to CCI 44. DoD has defined the maximum number as three.
  DoD has defined the time period as 15 minutes.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated access control policy

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks

  3.) Documentation that shows the system is configured to limit invalid logon
  attempts by a user to three attempts during a 15 minute time period.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to limit invalid logon
  attempts by a user to three attempts during a 15 minute time period. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 44. DoD has defined the maximum number as three. DoD has defined the
  time period as 15 minutes.

test-results: 'UDS addresses unsuccessful login attempt controls via
  Keycloakâs brute force protection features. Keycloak can automatically lock
  an account or temporarily disable login for a username after a configurable
  number of failed login attemptsâ. By enabling this in the Keycloak realm
  settings, if an attacker (or user) enters an incorrect password repeatedly,
  Keycloak will trigger a temporary lockout or even require administrator
  intervention after the threshold is exceededâ. This mechanism ensures that
  repeated failed login attempts are thwarted and accounts are not vulnerable to
  brute-force guessing attacks. The duration of lockout and thresholds are
  configurable to meet organizational policy. Thus, the stack meets the intent
  by providing a built-in technical control to automatically record unsuccessful
  login attempts and take action (lockout) when a defined limit is reached.'
