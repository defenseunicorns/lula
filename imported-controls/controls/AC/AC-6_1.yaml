control-acronym: AC-6
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs the principle of least privilege, allowing only
  authorized accesses for users (or processes acting on behalf of users) which
  are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with organizational
  missions and business functions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations employ least privilege for specific duties and information
  systems. The principle of least privilege is also applied to information
  system processes, ensuring that the processes operate at privilege levels no
  higher than necessary to accomplish required organizational missions/business
  functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles,
  and information system accounts as necessary, to achieve least privilege.
  Organizations also apply least privilege to the development, implementation,
  and operation of organizational information systems. Related controls: AC-2,
  AC-3, AC-5, CM-6, CM-7, PL-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing least
  privilege; list of assigned access authorizations (user privileges);
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  defining least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing least privilege
  functions].

  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements the concept
  of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for users (and processes
  acting on behalf of users) which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in
  accordance with organizational missions and business functions.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated access control policy

  2.) Signed and dated documentation that defines the concept of least
  privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for users (and processes acting
  on behalf of users) which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in
  accordance with organizational missions and business functions

  3.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented processes to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed implements the concept of least privilege, allowing
  only authorized accesses for users (and processes acting on behalf of users)
  which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with
  organizational missions and business functions.

test-results: "UDS strongly supports the principle of least privilege. Keycloak
  enforces least privilege access through role-based access control (RBAC),
  supporting predefined account types (General User, Admin, Viewer, etc.) and
  hierarchical security grouping. By default, components and accounts in the
  stack have minimal rights: for example, new Keycloak users have no roles until
  assigned, and Kubernetes service accounts have no permissions unless bound to
  a role. Administrators explicitly grant only the necessary privileges via
  roles and permissions. Kubernetes RBAC is used to ensure accounts (and even
  applications) only get the minimal permissions needed to functionâ.
  Additionally, container workloads can be restricted to least privilege at the
  OS level (running as non-root users, minimal file system privileges) which is
  encouraged and can be enforced by policy (via Pepr or admission controllers
  requiring securityContext settings). The AuthService/Keycloak integration also
  means applications don't each have elevated privileges for authentication;
  instead, they delegate to Keycloak, further limiting where sensitive
  credentials are used. Every layer cluster, service mesh, and application uses
  roles and policies to ensure no entity has more access than absolutely
  required, effectively implementing least privilege."
