  Description:

  The information system automatically audits account creation, modification,
  enabling, disabling, and removal actions, and notifies [Assignment:
  organization-defined personnel or roles].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related controls: AU-2, AU-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; notifications/alerts of
  account creation, modification, enabling, disabling, and removal actions;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing account management
  functions].

cci-definition: '002132: The information system notifies organization-defined
  personnel or roles for account enabling actions.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  notify the system administrator and ISSO for account enabling actions. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 2132. DoD has defined the personnel or roles as the
  system administrator and ISSO.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Audit trail of account enabling actions.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to notify the system
  administrator and ISSO for account enabling actions. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 2132. DoD has defined the
  personnel or roles as the system administrator and ISSO.

test-results: 'Keycloak provides all account lifecycle events â account
  creation, modification, enabling/disabling, and deletions are recorded as
  admin eventsâ. These audit records are forwarded to UDSâs centralized
  logging (Loki), preserving a history of account actions. Notifications to
  personnel can be configured. Keycloak supports event listeners if required
  (e.g., sending an email to administrators when an account is created or
  deleted)â. With these capabilities, UDS meets the intent by auditing account
  changes and (optionally) alerting administrators of those changes.'
