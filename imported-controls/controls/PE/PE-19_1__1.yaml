control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization ensures that information system components, associated data
  communications, and networks are protected in accordance with national
  emissions and TEMPEST policies and procedures based on the security category
  or classification of the information.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing information leakage that comply with national emissions
  and TEMPEST policies and procedures; information system component design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  information system environmental controls; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Information system components for compliance with national
  emissions and TEMPEST policies and procedures].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will obtain a TEMPEST countermeasure
  review and implement the required countermeasures in order to protect the
  information system from information leakage due to electromagnetic signals
  emanations.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documented TEMPEST countermeasure review results
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the TEMPEST countermeasures review and inspects the
  information system to ensure those countermeasures have been implemented.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Physical access controls,
  monitoring, device protection, etc., must be managed in the data center, cloud
  facility, or on-premise environment and are not functions of UDS. UDS assumes
  the physical environment is secured per organizational policy.)
