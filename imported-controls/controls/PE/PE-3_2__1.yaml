control-acronym: PE-3(2)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization performs security checks [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency] at the physical boundary of the facility or information system for
  unauthorized exfiltration of information or removal of information system
  components.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations determine the extent, frequency, and/or randomness of security
  checks to adequately mitigate risk associated with exfiltration. Related
  controls: AC-4, SC-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing physical access control; physical access control logs or
  records; records of security checks; security audit reports; security
  inspection reports; facility layout documentation; information system entry
  and exit points; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with physical access control
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for physical access control to
  the facility and/or information system; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing physical access control for the facility or information system;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing security checks for
  unauthorized exfiltration of information].

cci-definition: '000929: Perform security checks in accordance with
  organization-defined frequency at the physical boundary of the facility or
  system for unauthorized exfiltration of information or removal of information
  system components.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements procedures
  to perform security checks at the physical boundary of the facility or
  information system at a minimum, annually. The organization must maintain an
  audit trail of security checks at the physical boundary. DoD has defined the
  frequency as at a minimum, annually.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documented procedures for security checks

  2.) Audit trails of security checks
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented procedures as well as the audit trail of security checks at the
  physical boundary to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed performs
  security checks at the physical boundary of the facility or information system
  at a minimum, annually.

  DoD has defined the frequency as at a minimum, annually.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Physical access controls,
  monitoring, device protection, etc., must be managed in the data center, cloud
  facility, or on-premise environment and are not functions of UDS. UDS assumes
  the physical environment is secured per organizational policy.)
