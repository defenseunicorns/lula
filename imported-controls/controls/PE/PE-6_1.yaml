control-acronym: PE-6
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Monitors physical access to the facility where the information system
  resides to detect and respond to physical security incidents;

  b. Reviews physical access logs [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]
  and upon occurrence of [Assignment: organization-defined events or potential
  indications of events]; and

  c. Coordinates results of reviews and investigations with the organizational
  incident response capability.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizational incident response capabilities include investigations of and
  responses to detected physical security incidents. Security incidents include,
  for example, apparent security violations or suspicious physical access
  activities. Suspicious physical access activities include, for example: (i)
  accesses outside of normal work hours; (ii) repeated accesses to areas not
  normally accessed; (iii) accesses for unusual lengths of time; and (iv)
  out-of-sequence accesses. Related controls: CA-7, IR-4, IR-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing physical access monitoring; security plan; physical
  access logs or records; physical access monitoring records; physical access
  log reviews; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with physical access
  monitoring responsibilities; organizational personnel with incident response
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for monitoring physical access;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing physical access
  monitoring; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing reviewing of
  physical access logs].

  facility where the information system resides to detect and respond to
  physical security incidents.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will implement monitoring procedures
  to ensure physical access intrusion alarms and surveillance equipment are
  actively monitored to detect and respond to all physical access security
  incidents.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Facility access control policy and procedures, including a section on
  monitoring and response to physical access security incidents

  2.) AAR for any physical access security incidents
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the inspected organization's monitoring procedures
  addressing physical access monitoring. Organizational personnel with physical
  access monitoring responsibilities are to be interviewed. The objective of the
  reviews and interviews is to validate the organization is actively monitoring
  its physical access intrusion alarms and surveillance equipment to detect and
  respond to all physical access security incidents.
