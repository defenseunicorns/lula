control-acronym: PE-10
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Provides the capability of shutting off power to the information system or
  individual system components in emergency situations;

  b. Places emergency shutoff switches or devices in [Assignment:
  organization-defined location by information system or system component] to
  facilitate safe and easy access for personnel; and

  c. Protects emergency power shutoff capability from unauthorized activation.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies primarily to facilities containing concentrations of
  information system resources including, for example, data centers, server
  rooms, and mainframe computer rooms. Related control: PE-15.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing power source emergency shutoff; security plan; emergency
  shutoff controls or switches; locations housing emergency shutoff switches and
  devices; security safeguards protecting emergency power shutoff capability
  from unauthorized activation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  emergency power shutoff capability (both implementing and using the
  capability); organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  emergency power shutoff].

implementation-guidance: >-
  This control does not apply to individual workstations, laptops, printers,
  etc. This control only applies to facilities containing concentrations of
  information system resources (e.g., datacenters, server rooms, mainframe
  computer rooms). The organization being inspected/assessed will establish and
  document the capability to shut off the power to facilities or areas within
  facilities containing concentrations of information system resources (e.g.,
  datacenters, server rooms, mainframe computer rooms) in emergency situations.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation of the capability to shut off the power to facilities or
  areas within facilities containing concentrations of information system
  resources
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines documentation of the capability to shut off the power to
  facilities or areas within facilities containing concentrations of information
  system resources (e.g., datacenters, server rooms, mainframe computer rooms)
  in emergency situations. The purpose is to validate the organization has
  provided the capability of shutting off power in emergency situations.
