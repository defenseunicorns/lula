control-acronym: PE-4
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization controls physical access to [Assignment: organization-defined
  information system distribution and transmission lines] within organizational
  facilities using [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Physical security safeguards applied to information system distribution and
  transmission lines help to prevent accidental damage, disruption, and physical
  tampering. In addition, physical safeguards may be necessary to help prevent
  eavesdropping or in transit modification of unencrypted transmissions.
  Security safeguards to control physical access to system distribution and
  transmission lines include, for example: (i) locked wiring closets; (ii)
  disconnected or locked spare jacks; and/or (iii) protection of cabling by
  conduit or cable trays. Related controls: MP-2, MP-4, PE-2, PE-3, PE-5, SC-7,
  SC-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing access control for transmission medium; information
  system design documentation; facility communications and wiring diagrams; list
  of physical security safeguards applied to information system distribution and
  transmission lines; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with physical access control
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for access control to
  distribution and transmission lines; automated mechanisms/security safeguards
  supporting and/or implementing access control to distribution and transmission
  lines].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP
  Moderate Baseline, Rev 4

cci: 2930
cci-definition: '002930: The organization defines information system
  distribution and transmission lines within organizational facilities to
  control physical access using organization-defined security safeguards.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents information
  system distribution and transmission lines within organizational facilities to
  control physical access using organization-defined security safeguards. If
  transmission lines carry classified information, a protected distribution
  system (PDS) must be used to transmit unencrypted classified information
  through an area of lesser classification or control. For additional
  information, see NSTISSI No. 7003. DoD has determined the information system
  distribution and transmission lines are not appropriate to define at the
  Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  2.) Facility access policy and procedures
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented information system distribution and
  transmission lines to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed defines
  information system distribution and transmission lines within organizational
  facilities to control physical access using organization-defined security
  safeguards. DoD has determined the information system distribution and
  transmission lines are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
