control-acronym: PE-9
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization protects power equipment and power cabling for the
  information system from damage and destruction.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations determine the types of protection necessary for power equipment
  and cabling employed at different locations both internal and external to
  organizational facilities and environments of operation. This includes, for
  example, generators and power cabling outside of buildings, internal cabling
  and uninterruptable power sources within an office or data center, and power
  sources for self-contained entities such as vehicles and satellites. Related
  control: PE-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing power equipment/cabling protection; facilities housing
  power equipment/cabling; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  protecting power equipment/cabling; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  protection of power equipment/cabling].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP
  Moderate Baseline, Rev 4

  The organization being inspected/assessed provides a list of protective
  measures in place to prevent damage and/or destruction of power equipment and
  power cabling for their information system environment, IAW CP-2 (1), CCI 469.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) List of protective measures to prevent damage to the system
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the list of protective measures. Physical inspection of
  power equipment and power cabling will be done to ensure identified protective
  measures are in place.
