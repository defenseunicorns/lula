control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization requires the developer of the information system, system
  component, or information system service to identify early in the system
  development life cycle, the functions, ports, protocols, and services intended
  for organizational use.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services early in the
  system development life cycle (e.g., during the initial requirements
  definition and design phases) allows organizations to influence the design of
  the information system, information system component, or information system
  service. This early involvement in the life cycle helps organizations to avoid
  or minimize the use of functions, ports, protocols, or services that pose
  unnecessarily high risks and understand the trade-offs involved in blocking
  specific ports, protocols, or services (or when requiring information system
  service providers to do so). Early identification of functions, ports,
  protocols, and services avoids costly retrofitting of security controls after
  the information system, system component, or information system service has
  been implemented. SA-9 describes requirements for external information system
  services with organizations identifying which functions, ports, protocols, and
  services are provided from external sources. Related controls: CM-7, SA-9.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing the integration of information security requirements, descriptions,
  and criteria into the acquisition process; information system design
  documentation; information system documentation including functions, ports,
  protocols, and services intended for organizational use; acquisition contracts
  for information systems or services; acquisition documentation; solicitation
  documentation; service-level agreements; organizational security requirements,
  descriptions, and criteria for developers of information systems, system
  components, and information system services; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with acquisition/contracting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibility for determining
  information system security requirements; system/network administrators;
  organizational personnel operating, using, and/or maintaining the information
  system; information system developers; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents within
  contracts/agreements, the requirement that the developer of the information
  system, system component, or information system service identify early in the
  system development life cycle, the functions, ports, protocols, and services
  intended for organizational use.


  Ports identified shall be assessed and planned for in light of DISA's PPSM
  requirements.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP).

  2.) System development life cycle (SDLC) documentation identifies functions,
  ports, protocols and services intended for use.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the contracts/agreements to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed requires that the developer of the information system,
  system component, or information system service identify early in the system
  development life cycle, the functions, ports, protocols, and services intended
  for organizational use.
