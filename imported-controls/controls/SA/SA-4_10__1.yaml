control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs only information technology products on the FIPS
  201-approved products list for Personal Identity Verification (PIV) capability
  implemented within organizational information systems.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related controls: IA-2; IA-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing the integration of information security requirements, descriptions,
  and criteria into the acquisition process; solicitation documentation;
  acquisition documentation; acquisition contracts for the information system,
  system component, or information system service; service-level agreements;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with acquisition/contracting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibility for determining
  information system security requirements; organizational personnel with
  responsibility for ensuring only FIPS 201-approved products are implemented;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for selecting and employing FIPS
  201-approved products].

  systems.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed employs DoD approved PKI tokens for
  identity verification.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP) must document Personal Identify Verification
  (PIV) capability being implemented for organization information systems.

  2.) Documented confirmation of FIPS 201-approved products list.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure DoD approved PKI tokens are
  implemented for identity verification.
