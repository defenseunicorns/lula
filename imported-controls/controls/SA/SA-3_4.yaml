  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Manages the information system using [Assignment: organization-defined
  system development life cycle] that incorporates information security
  considerations;

  b. Defines and documents information security roles and responsibilities
  throughout the system development life cycle;

  c. Identifies individuals having information security roles and
  responsibilities; and

  d. Integrates the organizational information security risk management process
  into system development life cycle activities.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A well-defined system development life cycle provides the foundation for the
  successful development, implementation, and operation of organizational
  information systems. To apply the required security controls within the system
  development life cycle requires a basic understanding of information security,
  threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical
  missions/business functions. The security engineering principles in SA-8
  cannot be properly applied if individuals that design, code, and test
  information systems and system components (including information technology
  products) do not understand security. Therefore, organizations include
  qualified personnel, for example, chief information security officers,
  security architects, security engineers, and information system security
  officers in system development life cycle activities to ensure that security
  requirements are incorporated into organizational information systems. It is
  equally important that developers include individuals on the development team
  that possess the requisite security expertise and skills to ensure that needed
  security capabilities are effectively integrated into the information system.
  Security awareness and training programs can help ensure that individuals
  having key security roles and responsibilities have the appropriate
  experience, skills, and expertise to conduct assigned system development life
  cycle activities. The effective integration of security requirements into
  enterprise architecture also helps to ensure that important security
  considerations are addressed early in the system development life cycle and
  that those considerations are directly related to the organizational
  mission/business processes. This process also facilitates the integration of
  the information security architecture into the enterprise architecture,
  consistent with organizational risk management and information security
  strategies. Related controls: AT-3, PM-7, SA-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing the integration of information security into the system development
  life cycle process; information system development life cycle documentation;
  information security risk management strategy/program documentation; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  and system life cycle development responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with information security risk management responsibilities; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for defining and documenting the
  SDLC; organizational processes for identifying SDLC roles and
  responsibilities; organizational process for integrating information security
  risk management into the SDLC; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing the SDLC].

  information system security roles and responsibilities.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed identifies and documents individuals
  having information system security roles and responsibilities.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP).

  2.) System development life cycle (SDLC) documentation defines security roles
  and responsibilities.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented individuals having information system
  security roles and responsibilities to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed identifies individuals having information system security
  roles and responsibilities.

  following secure SDLC by Defense Unicorns; when the organization develops
  custom apps to run on UDS, they should follow their own secure SDLC
  requirements.)
