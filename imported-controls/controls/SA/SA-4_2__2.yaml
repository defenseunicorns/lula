control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization requires the developer of the information system, system
  component, or information system service to provide design and implementation
  information for the security controls to be employed that includes: [Selection
  (one or more): security-relevant external system interfaces; high-level
  design; low-level design; source code or hardware schematics; [Assignment:
  organization-defined design/implementation information]] at [Assignment:
  organization-defined level of detail].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations may require different levels of detail in design and
  implementation documentation for security controls employed in organizational
  information systems, system components, or information system services based
  on mission/business requirements, requirements for trustworthiness/resiliency,
  and requirements for analysis and testing. Information systems can be
  partitioned into multiple subsystems. Each subsystem within the system can
  contain one or more modules. The high-level design for the system is expressed
  in terms of multiple subsystems and the interfaces between subsystems
  providing security-relevant functionality. The low-level design for the system
  is expressed in terms of modules with particular emphasis on software and
  firmware (but not excluding hardware) and the interfaces between modules
  providing security-relevant functionality. Source code and hardware schematics
  are typically referred to as the implementation representation of the
  information system. Related control: SA-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing the integration of information security requirements, descriptions,
  and criteria into the acquisition process; solicitation documents; acquisition
  documentation; acquisition contracts for the information system, system
  components, or information system services; design and implementation
  information for security controls employed in the information system, system
  component, or information system service; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with acquisition/contracting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibility for determining
  information system security requirements; information system developer or
  service provider; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for determining level of detail
  for system design and security controls; organizational processes for
  developing acquisition contracts; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing development of system design details].

cci-definition: '003102: The organization requires the developer of the
  information system, system component, or information system service to provide
  implementation information for the security controls to be employed that

  low-level design, source code and/or hardware schematics organization-defined

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents in
  contracts/agreements, the implementation information for the security controls
  that the developer will employ in the information system to include
  security-relevant external system interfaces, high-level design, low-level
  design, source code and/or hardware schematics and/or implementation
  information defined in SA-4 (2), CCI 3104 at the level of detail defined in
  SA-4 (2), CCI 3106.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP).

  2.) System development life cycle (SDLC) documentation includes implementation
  information by the system developer.

  3.) Security control documentation includes security-relevant external system
  interfaces, high-level design, low-level design, source code, hardware
  schematics and organization defined design/information level of detail.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the contracts/agreements to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed requires the developer of the information system, system
  component, or information system service to provide implementation information
  for the security controls to be employed that includes security-relevant
  external system interfaces, high-level design, low-level design, source code
  and/or hardware schematics and/or implementation information defined in SA-4
  (2), CCI 3104 at the level of detail defined in SA-4 (2), CCI 3106.
