control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Employs only government off-the-shelf (GOTS) or commercial off-the-shelf
  (COTS) information assurance (IA) and IA-enabled information technology
  products that compose an NSA-approved solution to protect classified
  information when the networks used to transmit the information are at a lower
  classification level than the information being transmitted; and

  (b) Ensures that these products have been evaluated and/or validated by NSA or
  in accordance with NSA-approved procedures.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  COTS IA or IA-enabled information technology products used to protect
  classified information by cryptographic means may be required to use
  NSA-approved key management. Related controls: SC-8, SC-12, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing the integration of information security requirements, descriptions,
  and criteria into the acquisition process; solicitation documents; acquisition
  documentation; acquisition contracts for the information system, system
  component, or information system service; security configurations to be
  implemented by developer of the information system, system component, or
  information system service; service-level agreements; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with acquisition/contracting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibility for determining
  information system security requirements; organizational personnel responsible
  for ensuring information assurance products are NSA-approved and are evaluated
  and/or validated products in accordance with NSA-approved procedures;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for selecting and employing
  evaluated and/or validated information assurance products and services that
  compose an NSA-approved solution to protect classified information].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed must identify and use NSA-approved
  encryption technologies to protect classified information when the networks or
  transmission medium used to transmit the information are at a lower
  classification level than the information being transmitted.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP).

  2.) System development life cycle (SDLC) documentation includes information as
  it relates to GOTS or COTS.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines and verifies identified encryption technologies in use by the
  organization being inspected/assessed are NSA-approved.
