control-acronym: SA-2
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Determines information security requirements for the information system or
  information system service in mission/business process planning;

  b. Determines, documents, and allocates the resources required to protect the
  information system or information system service as part of its capital
  planning and investment control process; and

  c. Establishes a discrete line item for information security in organizational
  programming and budgeting documentation.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Resource allocation for information security includes funding for the initial
  information system or information system service acquisition and funding for
  the sustainment of the system/service. Related controls: PM-3, PM-11.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing the allocation of resources to information security requirements;
  procedures addressing capital planning and investment control; organizational
  programming and budgeting documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with capital planning,
  investment control, organizational programming and budgeting responsibilities;
  organizational personnel responsible for determining information security
  requirements for information systems/services; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for determining information
  security requirements; organizational processes for capital planning,
  programming, and budgeting; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing organizational capital planning, programming, and budgeting].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed identifies and establishes an
  individual line item for cybersecurity requirements to protect the information
  system as part of the planning, programming, and budget process (PPBE).

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Planning, programming and budget process (PPBE) documentation has a
  discrete individual line item for cybersecurity requirements.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the planning, programming, and budget documentation to
  ensure the organization being inspected/assessed has identified and
  established an individual line item for cybersecurity requirements to protect
  the information system.
