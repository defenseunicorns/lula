control-acronym: IA-4(4)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization manages individual identifiers by uniquely identifying each
  individual as [Assignment: organization-defined characteristic identifying
  individual status].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Characteristics identifying the status of individuals include, for example,
  contractors and foreign nationals. Identifying the status of individuals by
  specific characteristics provides additional information about the people with
  whom organizational personnel are communicating. For example, it might be
  useful for a government employee to know that one of the individuals on an
  email message is a contractor. Related control: AT-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing identifier management; procedures addressing account management;
  list of characteristics identifying individual status; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with identifier management
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  identifier management].

  DoD has defined the characteristics as contractor or government employee and
  by nationality. User identifiers will follow the same format as DoD user
  e-mail addresses (john.smith.ctr@army.mil or john.smith.uk@army.mil); - DoD
  user e-mail display names (e.g., John Smith, Contractor
  <john.smith.ctr@army.mil> or John Smith, United Kingdom
  <john.smith.uk@army.mil>); and - automated signature blocks (e.g., John Smith,
  Contractor, J-6K, Joint Staff or John Doe, Australia, LNO, Combatant Command).
  Contractors who are also foreign nationals are identified as both, e.g.,
  john.smith.ctr.uk@army.mil

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically Compliant
assessment-procedures: The organization being inspected/assessed is
  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the characteristics as contractor or government
  employee and by nationality. User identifiers will follow the same format as
  DoD user e-mail addresses (john.smith.ctr@army.mil or john.smith.uk@army.mil);
  - DoD user e-mail display names (e.g., John Smith, Contractor
  <john.smith.ctr@army.mil> or John Smith, United Kingdom
  <john.smith.uk@army.mil>); and - automated signature blocks (e.g., John Smith,
  Contractor, J-6K, Joint Staff or John Doe, Australia, LNO, Combatant Command).
  Contractors who are also foreign nationals are identified as both, e.g.,
  john.smith.ctr.uk@army.mil
