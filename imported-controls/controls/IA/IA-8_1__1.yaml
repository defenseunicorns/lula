  Description:

  The information system accepts and electronically verifies Personal Identity
  Verification (PIV) credentials from other federal agencies.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement applies to logical access control systems (LACS) and
  physical access control systems (PACS). Personal Identity Verification (PIV)
  credentials are those credentials issued by federal agencies that conform to
  FIPS Publication 201 and supporting guidance documents. OMB Memorandum 11-11
  requires federal agencies to continue implementing the requirements specified
  in HSPD-12 to enable agency-wide use of PIV credentials. Related controls:
  AU-2, PE-3, SA-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing user identification and authentication; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; PIV verification records;
  evidence of PIV credentials; PIV credential authorizations; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  operations responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers;
  organizational personnel with account management responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  identification and authentication capability; automated mechanisms that accept
  and verify PIV credentials].

  The information system performing hardware token-based authentication must be
  configured to accept DoD-approved external PKI PIV credentials to authenticate
  federal agency users in accordance with DoDI 8520.02 and DoDI 8520.03. The
  information system must be configured to accept only certificates at approved
  assurance levels, as represented by the Certificate Policy Object Identifiers
  (OIDs) asserted in the certificate. The current list of DoD-approved external
  PKIs and acceptable Object Identifiers (OIDs) for each approved external PKI
  is available at http://iase.disa.mil/pki-pke/interoperability. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  2009.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP documenting configuration of the information
  system performing hardware token-based authentication to accept DoD-approved
  external PKI PIV credentials to authenticate federal agency users in
  accordance with DoDI 8520.02 and DoDI 8520.03.

  2.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP documenting the configuration of the information
  system to accept only certificates at approved assurance levels, as
  represented by the Certificate Policy Object Identifiers (OIDs) asserted in
  the certificate.

  3.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed has configured the information system to accept
  DoD-approved external PKI PIV credentials in accordance with DoDI 8520.02 and
  DoDI 8520.03. The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines
  the information system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system to accept only DoD-approved external PKI PIV
  credentials that assert an approved Certificate Policy OID and reject
  credentials issued off of DoD-approved external PKIs that do not assert an
  approved OID. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the
  components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 2009.
