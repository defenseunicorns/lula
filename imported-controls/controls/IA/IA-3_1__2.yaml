control-acronym: IA-3(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system authenticates [Assignment: organization-defined
  specific devices and/or types of devices] before establishing [Selection (one
  or more): local; remote; network] connection using bidirectional
  authentication that is cryptographically based.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A local connection is any connection with a device communicating without the
  use of a network. A network connection is any connection with a device that
  communicates through a network (e.g., local area or wide area network,
  Internet). A remote connection is any connection with a device communicating
  through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Bidirectional authentication
  provides stronger safeguards to validate the identity of other devices for
  connections that are of greater risk (e.g., remote connections). Related
  controls: SC-8, SC-12, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing device identification and authentication; information system design
  documentation; list of devices requiring unique identification and
  authentication; device connection reports; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with operational
  responsibilities for device identification and authentication; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system/network
  administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing device
  authentication capability; cryptographically based bidirectional
  authentication mechanisms].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  use cryptographically based bidirectional authentication. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  1967.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation for use of cryptographically based
  bidirectional authentication.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examine a sampling of the network infrastructure device configurations to
  ensure devices connecting to the infrastructure use cryptographically based
  bidirectional authentication. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 1967.

test-results: 'Device authentication is handled in UDS through mutual TLS and
  certificate-based trust between components. Each server/node in the Kubernetes
  cluster has its own credentials (certificates for the kubelet, etc.) and each
  service in the service mesh has a certificate identity (issued by Istioâs
  Citadel). These certificates are used to authenticate machines and services to
  each other. For example, when Service A connects to Service B within the mesh,
  it presents its certificate and Bâs sidecar verifies it only if itâs a
  valid known service cert will communication proceed. This means that devices
  and applications are being authenticated at the network layer without user
  involvement.'
