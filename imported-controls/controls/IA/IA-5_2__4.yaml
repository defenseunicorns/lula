  Description:

  The information system, for PKI-based authentication

  (a) Validates certifications by constructing and verifying a certification
  path to an accepted trust anchor including checking certificate status
  information;

  (b) Enforces authorized access to the corresponding private key;

  (c) Maps the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group;
  and

  (d) Implements a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and
  validation in case of inability to access revocation information via the
  network.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Status information for certification paths includes, for example, certificate
  revocation lists or certificate status protocol responses. For PIV cards,
  validation of certifications involves the construction and verification of a
  certification path to the Common Policy Root trust anchor including
  certificate policy processing. Related control: IA-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  addressing authenticator management; security plan; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; PKI certification validation records; PKI certification
  revocation lists; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with PKI-based,
  authenticator management responsibilities; organizational personnel with

  implements a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and
  validation in case of inability to access revocation information via the
  network.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The information system must be configured to locally cache revocation data to
  support path discovery and validation in case of inability to access
  revocation information via the network. The information system may meet this
  requirement by locally caching certificate revocation lists (CRLs), Online
  Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responses, or a combination thereof. Cached
  revocation data must include revocation information from all PKIs serving
  known or anticipated users of the information system. Cached data must be
  refreshed with a frequency shorter than the life of the data (e.g. if a CRL is
  valid for 7 days, a new CRL must be retrieved and cached more frequently than
  every 7 days) to ensure that cached data is valid and not expired. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 1991.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP configuring the information system to locally
  cache revocation data to support path discovery and validation in case of
  inability to access revocation information via the network.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: 'The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed has configured the information system to locally cache
  revocation data (CRLs and/or OCSP responses) to support path discovery and
  validation in case of inability to access revocation information via the
  network. The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the
  information system to ensure that revocation data is cached for all PKIs
  serving known or anticipated users of the information system. The organization
  conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information system to ensure
  the organization being inspected/assessed has configured a process for the
  information system to refresh cached revocation data prior to the dataâs
  expiration. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the
  components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 1991.'

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS through its
  integrated identity management solution (Keycloak), supports PKI-based
  authentication using DoD-approved certificates (e.g., CAC/PIV) and inherently
  provides capabilities for certificate revocation checking via Certificate
  Revocation Lists (CRLs) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). However,
  Keycloak by default relies primarily on live network-based checks (e.g., OCSP
  responders or CRLs via external URLs) and does not natively maintain an
  internal local cache of revocation data. To fully meet this control, the
  deploying organization should explicitly configure local caching mechanisms or
  implement intermediate caching proxies that periodically retrieve and locally
  store CRL data. Although technically achievable within UDS deployments via
  external configuration (such as proxying OCSP responders or local CRL caches),
  explicit local caching and periodic refresh of revocation data must be
  established by the organization as part of the deployment architecture.)
