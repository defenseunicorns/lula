control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization manages individual identifiers by uniquely identifying each
  individual as [Assignment: organization-defined characteristic identifying
  individual status].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Characteristics identifying the status of individuals include, for example,
  contractors and foreign nationals. Identifying the status of individuals by
  specific characteristics provides additional information about the people with
  whom organizational personnel are communicating. For example, it might be
  useful for a government employee to know that one of the individuals on an
  email message is a contractor. Related control: AT-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing identifier management; procedures addressing account management;
  list of characteristics identifying individual status; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with identifier management
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  identifier management].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to manage individual identifiers by uniquely identifying each individual as
  contractor or government employee and by nationality. User identifiers will
  follow the same format as DoD user e-mail addresses (john.smith.ctr@army.mil
  or john.smith.uk@army.mil); - DoD user e-mail display names (e.g., John Smith,
  Contractor <john.smith.ctr@army.mil> or John Smith, United Kingdom
  <john.smith.uk@army.mil>); and - automated signature blocks (e.g., John Smith,
  Contractor, J-6K, Joint Staff or John Doe, Australia, LNO, Combatant Command).
  Contractors who are also foreign nationals are identified as both, e.g.,
  john.smith.ctr.uk@army.mil. DoD has defined the characteristics as contractor
  or government employee and by nationality. User identifiers will follow the
  same format as DoD user e-mail addresses (john.smith.ctr@army.mil or
  john.smith.uk@army.mil); - DoD user e-mail display names (e.g., John Smith,
  Contractor <john.smith.ctr@army.mil> or John Smith, United Kingdom
  <john.smith.uk@army.mil>); and - automated signature blocks (e.g., John Smith,
  Contractor, J-6K, Joint Staff or John Doe, Australia, LNO, Combatant Command).
  Contractors who are also foreign nationals are identified as both, e.g.,
  john.smith.ctr.uk@army.mil. Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP documenting the process for management of
  individual identifiers by uniquely identifying each individual as contractor
  or government employee and by nationality.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed manages individual identifiers by uniquely identifying each
  individual as contractor or government employee and by nationality. User
  identifiers will follow the same format as DoD user e-mail addresses
  (john.smith.ctr@army.mil or john.smith.uk@army.mil); - DoD user e-mail display
  names (e.g., John Smith, Contractor <john.smith.ctr@army.mil> or John Smith,
  United Kingdom <john.smith.uk@army.mil>); and - automated signature blocks
  (e.g., John Smith, Contractor, J-6K, Joint Staff or John Doe, Australia, LNO,
  Combatant Command). Contractors who are also foreign nationals are identified
  as both, e.g., john.smith.ctr.uk@army.mil. DoD has defined the characteristics
  as contractor or government employee and by nationality. User identifiers will
  follow the same format as DoD user e-mail addresses (john.smith.ctr@army.mil
  or john.smith.uk@army.mil); - DoD user e-mail display names (e.g., John Smith,
  Contractor <john.smith.ctr@army.mil> or John Smith, United Kingdom
  <john.smith.uk@army.mil>); and - automated signature blocks (e.g., John Smith,
  Contractor, J-6K, Joint Staff or John Doe, Australia, LNO, Combatant Command).
  Contractors who are also foreign nationals are identified as both, e.g.,
  john.smith.ctr.uk@army.mil.

test-results: UDS fully supports managing individual identifiers through its
  integrated identity management solution, Keycloak, ensuring each user is
  uniquely identified according to defined organizational characteristics
  (government employee or contractor, including nationality). Keycloak's
  flexible username and account schema can strictly follow DoD-defined naming
  conventions and formats (e.g., per implementation guidance;
  john.smith.ctr@army.mil, john.smith.uk@army.mil, or combined identifiers such
  as john.smith.ctr.uk@army.mil). Display names within Keycloak and integrated
  applications are similarly configurable to reflect appropriate organizational
  conventions, clearly identifying users as contractors, government employees,
  or foreign nationals.
