  Description:

  The information system implements multifactor authentication for remote access
  to privileged and non-privileged accounts such that one of the factors is
  provided by a device separate from the system gaining access and the device
  meets [Assignment: organization-defined strength of mechanism requirements].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  For remote access to privileged/non-privileged accounts, the purpose of
  requiring a device that is separate from the information system gaining access
  for one of the factors during multifactor authentication is to reduce the
  likelihood of compromising authentication credentials stored on the system.
  For example, adversaries deploying malicious code on organizational
  information systems can potentially compromise such credentials resident on
  the system and subsequently impersonate authorized users. Related control:
  AC-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing user identification and authentication; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; list of privileged and
  non-privileged information system accounts; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  operations responsibilities; organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  identification and authentication capability].

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically Compliant
assessment-procedures: The organization being inspected/assessed is
  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. For the strength of mechanism requirements DoD has defined requirements
