control-acronym: IA-5(4)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs automated tools to determine if password
  authenticators are sufficiently strong to satisfy [Assignment:
  organization-defined requirements].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement focuses on the creation of strong passwords and the
  characteristics of such passwords (e.g., complexity) prior to use, the
  enforcement of which is carried out by organizational information systems in
  IA-5 (1). Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, RA-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing authenticator management; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  automated tools for evaluating password authenticators; password strength
  assessment results; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with authenticator
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  password-based authenticator management capability; automated tools for
  determining password strength].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed implements automated tools to check
  passwords strength per the complexity requirements defined in IA-5 (1) Part A.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP implementing automated tools to check password
  strength per the complexity requirements defined in IA-5 (1) Part A.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the automated tools and inspects the configuration of the automated
  tools to ensure that they are implemented to check password strength per the
  complexity requirements defined in IA-5 (1) Part A.

test-results: UDS provides built-in password strength enforcement through its
  centralized identity management solution, Keycloak. Keycloak allows
  administrators to define detailed, configurable password complexity policies,
  including minimum length, required special characters, numeric characters,
  uppercase, and lowercase letters.
