  Description:

  The organization manages information system authenticators by:

  a. Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity
  of the individual, group, role, or device receiving the authenticator;

  b. Establishing initial authenticator content for authenticators defined by
  the organization;

  c. Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for
  their intended use;

  d. Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial
  authenticator distribution, for lost/compromised or damaged authenticators,
  and for revoking authenticators;

  e. Changing default content of authenticators prior to information system
  installation;

  f. Establishing minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions and reuse conditions
  for authenticators;

  g. Changing/refreshing authenticators [Assignment: organization-defined time
  period by authenticator type];

  h. Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and
  modification;

  i. Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific
  security safeguards to protect authenticators; and

  j. Changing authenticators for group/role accounts when membership to those
  accounts changes.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Individual authenticators include, for example, passwords, tokens, biometrics,
  PKI certificates, and key cards. Initial authenticator content is the actual
  content (e.g., the initial password) as opposed to requirements about
  authenticator content (e.g., minimum password length). In many cases,
  developers ship information system components with factory default
  authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and
  configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well known, easily
  discoverable, and present a significant security risk. The requirement to
  protect individual authenticators may be implemented via control PL-4 or PS-6
  for authenticators in the possession of individuals and by controls AC-3,
  AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators stored within organizational information
  systems (e.g., passwords stored in hashed or encrypted formats, files
  containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with administrator
  privileges). Information systems support individual authenticator management
  by organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator
  characteristics including, for example, minimum password length, password
  composition, validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and
  number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric
  authentication. Specific actions that can be taken to safeguard authenticators
  include, for example, maintaining possession of individual authenticators, not
  loaning or sharing individual authenticators with others, and reporting lost,
  stolen, or compromised authenticators immediately. Authenticator management
  includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators for
  temporary access such as that required for remote maintenance. Device
  authenticators include, for example, certificates and passwords. Related

  SC-13, SC-17, SC-28.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing authenticator management; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation; list
  of information system authenticator types; change control records associated
  with managing information system authenticators; information system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with authenticator
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  authenticator management capability].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents procedures for
  setting initial authenticator content.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Key Management Policy

  2.) Signed and dated Account Creation SOP for procedures setting initial
  authenticator content
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented procedures for setting initial
  authenticator content to ensure they have been defined.

test-results: UDS manages initial authenticator content securely and effectively
  through its identity management solution, Keycloak. When authenticators such
  as passwords, tokens, or multifactor authentication (MFA) credentials are
  initially provisioned, Keycloak ensures they adhere to strong, configurable
  security standards defined by organizational policy (e.g., minimum complexity,
  randomly generated initial passwords, cryptographically secure token
  generation). Additionally, Keycloak allows administrators to enforce immediate
  authenticator changes upon first login, ensuring secure distribution and
  handling of initial credentials. These technical capabilities fully support
  organizational policies for establishing secure initial authenticator content.
