control-acronym: IA-3(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system authenticates [Assignment: organization-defined
  specific devices and/or types of devices] before establishing [Selection (one
  or more): local; remote; network] connection using bidirectional
  authentication that is cryptographically based.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A local connection is any connection with a device communicating without the
  use of a network. A network connection is any connection with a device that
  communicates through a network (e.g., local area or wide area network,
  Internet). A remote connection is any connection with a device communicating
  through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Bidirectional authentication
  provides stronger safeguards to validate the identity of other devices for
  connections that are of greater risk (e.g., remote connections). Related
  controls: SC-8, SC-12, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing device identification and authentication; information system design
  documentation; list of devices requiring unique identification and
  authentication; device connection reports; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with operational
  responsibilities for device identification and authentication; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system/network
  administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing device
  authentication capability; cryptographically based bidirectional
  authentication mechanisms].
