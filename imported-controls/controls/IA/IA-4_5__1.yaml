  Description:

  The information system dynamically manages identifiers.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  In contrast to conventional approaches to identification which presume static
  accounts for preregistered users, many distributed information systems
  including, for example, service-oriented architectures, rely on establishing
  identifiers at run time for entities that were previously unknown. In these
  situations, organizations anticipate and provision for the dynamic
  establishment of identifiers. Preestablished trust relationships and
  mechanisms with appropriate authorities to validate identities and related
  credentials are essential. Related control: AC-16.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing identifier management; procedures addressing account management;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with identifier management
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  dynamic identifier management].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  dynamically manage identifiers. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 1976.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) SOP/TTP referencing dynamically managed identifiers.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to dynamically manage
  identifiers. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the
  components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 1976.

test-results: In UDS, identifier management is dynamically automated and
  integrated across multiple components. Keycloak dynamically creates and
  manages unique user and service identifiers as accounts are provisioned, while
  Kubernetes through its service accounts and RBAC mechanisms automatically
  assigns unique identifiers to each microservice during deployment via
  Infrastructure as Code (OpenTofu). Istio further supports this dynamic
  identity framework by issuing and regularly rotating SPIFFE IDs for secure
  mutual TLS between services. Pepr policies ensure that any scaling or
  configuration changes trigger updates to these identifiers, and comprehensive
  audit logs maintained by Loki and Prometheus provide traceability and
  compliance. This coordinated, automated approach ensures that identifiers
  remain current, unique, and correctly mapped to authentication and
  authorization attributes throughout the UDS environment.
