control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system, for hardware token-based authentication, employs
  mechanisms that satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined token quality
  requirements].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Hardware token-based authentication typically refers to the use of PKI-based
  tokens, such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card.
  Organizations define specific requirements for tokens, such as working with a
  particular PKI.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing authenticator management; security plan; information system design
  documentation; automated mechanisms employing hardware token-based
  authentication for the information system; list of token quality requirements;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with authenticator
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  hardware token-based authenticator management capability].
