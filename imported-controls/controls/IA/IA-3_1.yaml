control-acronym: IA-3
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates [Assignment:
  organization-defined specific and/or types of devices] before establishing a
  [Selection (one or more): local; remote; network] connection.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizational devices requiring unique device-to-device identification and
  authentication may be defined by type, by device, or by a combination of
  type/device. Information systems typically use either shared known information
  (e.g., Media Access Control [MAC] or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
  Protocol [TCP/IP] addresses) for device identification or organizational
  authentication solutions (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible Authentication
  Protocol [EAP], Radius server with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS]
  authentication, Kerberos) to identify/authenticate devices on local and/or
  wide area networks. Organizations determine the required strength of
  authentication mechanisms by the security categories of information systems.
  Because of the challenges of applying this control on large scale,
  organizations are encouraged to only apply the control to those limited number
  (and type) of devices that truly need to support this capability. Related
  controls: AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, CA-3, IA-4, IA-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing device identification and authentication; information system design
  documentation; list of devices requiring unique identification and
  authentication; device connection reports; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with operational
  responsibilities for device identification and authentication; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system/network
  administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing device
  identification and authentication capability].
