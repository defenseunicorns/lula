  Description:

  The information system implements multifactor authentication for network
  access to privileged accounts.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related control: AC-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing user identification and authentication; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; list of information system
  accounts; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  operations responsibilities; organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  multifactor authentication capability].

cci: 765
cci-definition: '000765: Implement multifactor authentication for network access
  to privileged accounts.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  implement multifactor authentication for network access to privileged
  accounts. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG
  guidance that pertains to CCI 765.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Access Control Policy

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to implement multifactor
  authentication for network access to privileged accounts. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization
  conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that
  the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the information
  system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 765.

test-results: 'Keycloak supports MFA (such as OTP, mobile push, or U2F keys),
  and administrators can enforce that any user with admin roles must use MFA to
  login. Itâs straightforward to configure a realm such that realm
  administrators or any user in a privileged group must perform an extra
  authentication step (for example, Keycloak can be set up to require a one-time
  password from an authenticator app after password entry for admins). Given
  that privileged users (like cluster admins, Keycloak admins) would
  authenticate via Keycloak as well with a CAC, this meets the requirement that
  these accounts use MFA for network access.'
