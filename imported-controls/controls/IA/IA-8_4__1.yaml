control-acronym: IA-8(4)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system conforms to FICAM-issued profiles.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement addresses open identity management standards. To
  ensure that these standards are viable, robust, reliable, sustainable (e.g.,
  available in commercial information technology products), and interoperable as
  documented, the United States Government assesses and scopes identity
  management standards and technology implementations against applicable federal
  legislation, directives, policies, and requirements. The result is
  FICAM-issued implementation profiles of approved protocols (e.g., FICAM
  authentication protocols such as SAML 2.0 and OpenID 2.0, as well as other
  protocols such as the FICAM Backend Attribute Exchange). Related control:
  SA-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; system and
  services acquisition policy; procedures addressing user identification and
  authentication; procedures addressing the integration of security requirements
  into the acquisition process; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; list of FICAM-issued profiles and
  associated, approved protocols; acquisition documentation; acquisition
  contracts for information system procurements or services; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  operations responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers;
  organizational personnel with account management responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  identification and authentication capability; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing conformance with FICAM-issued profiles].

cci-definition: '002014: The information system conforms to FICAM-issued profiles.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  conform to Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM)-issued
  profiles. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG
  guidance that pertains to CCI 2014. FICAM Guidance is available at
  http://www.idmanagement.gov.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP documentation demonstrating that the information
  system is configured to conform to Federal Identity, Credential, and Access
  Management (FICAM)-issued profiles

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to conform to
  FICAM-issued profiles. For information system components that have applicable
  STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates
  the components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 2014.

test-results: 'Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS employs the Keycloak
  identity management component, which supports authentication integration with
  FICAM-approved identity and credentialing solutions, including DoD-approved
  PKI (such as CAC and PIV) and other FICAM-approved external credential
  providers. Keycloak itself provides the necessary technical
  capabilitiesâsuch as certificate-based authentication, validation, and
  federation with approved identity providers to meet FICAM compliance
  requirements. However, explicit verification and formal documentation of
  Keycloak as a FICAM-approved component, or integrating it explicitly with
  approved FICAM-compliant identity services, remain organizational
  responsibilities.)'
