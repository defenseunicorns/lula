  Description:

  The information system accepts and electronically verifies Personal Identity
  Verification (PIV) credentials from other federal agencies.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement applies to logical access control systems (LACS) and
  physical access control systems (PACS). Personal Identity Verification (PIV)
  credentials are those credentials issued by federal agencies that conform to
  FIPS Publication 201 and supporting guidance documents. OMB Memorandum 11-11
  requires federal agencies to continue implementing the requirements specified
  in HSPD-12 to enable agency-wide use of PIV credentials. Related controls:
  AU-2, PE-3, SA-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing user identification and authentication; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; PIV verification records;
  evidence of PIV credentials; PIV credential authorizations; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  operations responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers;
  organizational personnel with account management responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  identification and authentication capability; automated mechanisms that accept
  and verify PIV credentials].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The information system performing hardware token-based authentication must be
  configured to validate DoD-approved external PKI PIV credentials to
  authenticate federal agency users in accordance with RFC 5280. The information
  system must be configured to perform a revocation check as part of the
  certificate validation process. Revocation checking may be performed using
  certificate revocation lists (CRLs) published by the issuing PKI or Online
  Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) services. For information system components
  that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed
  must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 2010.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP documentation configuring the information system
  to validate DoD-approved external PKI PIV credentials in accordance with RFC
  5280.

  2.) Provide SOP/TTP documentation configuring the information system to
  perform a revocation check as part of the certificate validation process.

  3.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed has configured the information system to validate
  DoD-approved external PKI PIV credentials in accordance with RFC 5280. The
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system to perform a revocation check as part of the certificate
  validation process. For information system components that have applicable
  STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates
  the components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 2010.
