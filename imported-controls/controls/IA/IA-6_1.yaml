control-acronym: IA-6
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system obscures feedback of authentication information during
  the authentication process to protect the information from possible
  exploitation/use by unauthorized individuals.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The feedback from information systems does not provide information that would
  allow unauthorized individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For
  some types of information systems or system components, for example,
  desktops/notebooks with relatively large monitors, the threat (often referred
  to as shoulder surfing) may be significant. For other types of systems or
  components, for example, mobile devices with 2-4 inch screens, this threat may
  be less significant, and may need to be balanced against the increased
  likelihood of typographic input errors due to the small keyboards. Therefore,
  the means for obscuring the authenticator feedback is selected accordingly.
  Obscuring the feedback of authentication information includes, for example,
  displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input devices, or
  displaying feedback for a very limited time before fully obscuring it. Related
  control: PE-18.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing authenticator feedback; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the
  obscuring of feedback of authentication information during authentication].

  authentication information during the authentication process to protect the
  information from possible exploitation/use by unauthorized individuals.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  obscure feedback of authentication information during the authentication
  process to protect the information from possible exploitation/use by
  unauthorized individuals. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 206.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP for creating a test account to confirm
  information system obscures feedback of authentication information during the
  authentication process.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to obscure feedback of
  authentication information during the authentication process to protect the
  information from possible exploitation/use by unauthorized individuals. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 206.

test-results: 'UDS does not reveal sensitive info during login (like not telling
  which part of the credential was wrong). Keycloakâs behavior by default is
  to present generic error messages such as âInvalid username or passwordâ
  on a failed login, which does not specifically indicate if the username exists
  or not. This prevents an attacker from enumerating valid usernames. Also, when
  MFA is involved, Keycloak errors are careful not to divulge unnecessary
  detail. The UDS stackâs UIs do not expose password characters (they mask
  input) and do not echo back any secret info.'
