control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system implements multifactor authentication for network
  access to non-privileged accounts.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing user identification and authentication; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; list of information system
  accounts; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  operations responsibilities; organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  multifactor authentication capability].

cci: 766
cci-definition: '000766: Implement multifactor authentication for network access
  to non-privileged accounts.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  implement multifactor authentication for network access to non-privileged
  accounts. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG
  guidance that pertains to CCI 766.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Access Control Policy

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to implement multifactor
  authentication for network access to non-privileged accounts. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization
  conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that
  the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the information
  system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 766.

test-results: Consistent with IA-2(1).1, UDS enforces mandatory multifactor
  authentication (MFA) for all non-privileged user accounts accessing the
  network. UDS leverages Keycloak to require MFA, supporting secure,
  DoD-approved mechanisms such as Common Access Card (CAC) or Personal Identity
  Verification (PIV) cards paired with a PIN. Additionally, Keycloak offers
  flexible MFA options including One-Time Passwords (OTP), mobile push
  notifications, and Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) hardware tokens, ensuring
  comprehensive MFA coverage aligned with organizational policies and security
  requirements.
