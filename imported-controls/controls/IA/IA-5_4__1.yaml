control-acronym: IA-5(4)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs automated tools to determine if password
  authenticators are sufficiently strong to satisfy [Assignment:
  organization-defined requirements].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement focuses on the creation of strong passwords and the
  characteristics of such passwords (e.g., complexity) prior to use, the
  enforcement of which is carried out by organizational information systems in
  IA-5 (1). Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, RA-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing authenticator management; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  automated tools for evaluating password authenticators; password strength
  assessment results; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with authenticator
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  password-based authenticator management capability; automated tools for
  determining password strength].

  DoD has defined the requirements as the complexity as identified in IA-5 (1)
  Part A.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically Compliant
assessment-procedures: The organization being inspected/assessed is
  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the requirements as the complexity as identified in
  IA-5 (1) Part A.
