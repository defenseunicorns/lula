  Description:

  The organization provides training to its personnel on [Assignment:
  organization-defined indicators of malicious code] to recognize suspicious
  communications and anomalous behavior in organizational information systems.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A well-trained workforce provides another organizational safeguard that can be
  employed as part of a defense-in-depth strategy to protect organizations
  against malicious code coming in to organizations via email or the web
  applications. Personnel are trained to look for indications of potentially
  suspicious email (e.g., receiving an unexpected email, receiving an email
  containing strange or poor grammar, or receiving an email from an unfamiliar
  sender but who appears to be from a known sponsor or contractor). Personnel
  are also trained on how to respond to such suspicious email or web
  communications (e.g., not opening attachments, not clicking on embedded web
  links, and checking the source of email addresses). For this process to work
  effectively, all organizational personnel are trained and made aware of what
  constitutes suspicious communications. Training personnel on how to recognize
  anomalous behaviors in organizational information systems can potentially
  provide early warning for the presence of malicious code. Recognition of such
  anomalous behavior by organizational personnel can supplement automated
  malicious code detection and protection tools and systems employed by
  organizations.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  addressing security training implementation; security training curriculum;
  security training materials; security plan; training records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  role-based security training; organizational personnel that participate in
  security awareness training].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents indicators of
  malicious code to recognize suspicious communications and anomalous behavior
  in organizational information systems. DoD has determined the indicators are
  not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation that defines indicators of malicious code to recognize
  suspicious communications and anomalous behavior in organizational information
  systems.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented indicators to ensure the organization
  being inspected/assessed defines indicators of malicious code to recognize
  suspicious communications and anomalous behavior in organizational information
  systems. DoD has determined the indicators are not appropriate to define at
  the Enterprise level.
