  Description:

  The organization employs vulnerability scanning procedures that can identify
  the breadth and depth of coverage (i.e., information system components scanned
  and vulnerabilities checked).


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Procedures addressing vulnerability scanning; security
  plan; security assessment report; vulnerability scanning tools and associated
  configuration documentation; vulnerability scanning results; patch and
  vulnerability management records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with vulnerability scanning
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with vulnerability scan analysis
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for vulnerability scanning;
  automated mechanisms/tools supporting and/or implementing vulnerability
  scanning].

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP).

  2.) Reference to system security plan (SSP) section pertaining to
  vulnerability scanning procedure to define the scope and coverage.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the software list or vulnerability scanning procedures to
  ensure the organization being inspected/assessed employs the DoD Enterprise
  scanning tool.

test-results: UDS provides details of the vulnerability scanning coverage by
  identifying which packages are affected while also identifying with packages
  deployed in the cluster do not have contain CVE data. If a package does not
  contain CVE data the user is alerted with a notification banner informing the
  risk that there may be additional vulnerabilities on this system that are not
  documented in the report. This ensures that the UDS environment has
  appropriate coverage.
