control-acronym: RA-5(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs vulnerability scanning tools that include the
  capability to readily update the information system vulnerabilities to be
  scanned.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The vulnerabilities to be scanned need to be readily updated as new
  vulnerabilities are discovered, announced, and scanning methods developed.
  This updating process helps to ensure that potential vulnerabilities in the
  information system are identified and addressed as quickly as possible.
  Related controls: SI-3, SI-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Procedures addressing vulnerability scanning; security
  plan; security assessment report; vulnerability scanning tools and associated
  configuration documentation; vulnerability scanning results; patch and
  vulnerability management records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with vulnerability scanning
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for vulnerability scanning;
  automated mechanisms/tools supporting and/or implementing vulnerability
  scanning].

  vulnerabilities to be scanned.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will employ scanning tools that
  maintain currency with industry standard information system vulnerabilities to
  ensure that scanning activities are conducted with the most up to date list of
  known vulnerabilities to include USCYBERCOM issued IAVMs.

  DoD has provided an enterprise scanning tool that fully meets this
  requirement. Organizations that choose not to use the enterprise scanning tool
  must identify which scanning tool they are using and ensure that it meets
  these requirements.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation that scanning tool being used can be updated.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment will:

  1. If the inspected organization is using the DoD provided enterprise scanning
  tool, compliance with this control is complete.

  2. Validate the identified tool in use by the inspected organization is able
  to maintain current up to date information system vulnerability data.
