control-acronym: RA-5(5)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system implements privileged access authorization to
  [Assignment: organization-identified information system components] for
  selected [Assignment: organization-defined vulnerability scanning activities].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  In certain situations, the nature of the vulnerability scanning may be more
  intrusive or the information system component that is the subject of the
  scanning may contain highly sensitive information. Privileged access
  authorization to selected system components facilitates more thorough
  vulnerability scanning and also protects the sensitive nature of such
  scanning.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Risk assessment policy; procedures addressing
  vulnerability scanning; security plan; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; list of information system components for vulnerability
  scanning; personnel access authorization list; authorization credentials;
  access authorization records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with vulnerability scanning
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel
  responsible for access control to the information system; organizational
  personnel responsible for configuration management of the information system;
  system developers; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for vulnerability scanning;
  organizational processes for access control; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing access control; automated mechanisms/tools supporting
  and/or implementing vulnerability scanning].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  implement privileged access authorization to all information systems and
  infrastructure components for selected vulnerability scanning activities
  defined in RA-5 (5), CCI 2906. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 1067. DoD has defined
  the information system components as all information systems and
  infrastructure components.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP).

  2.) Reference to system security plan (SSP) section pertaining to the roles
  and responsibilities of vulnerability scanning.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to implement privileged
  access authorization to all information systems and infrastructure components
  for selected vulnerability scanning activities defined in RA-5 (5), CCI 2906.
  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 1067. DoD has defined the information system components as all
  information systems and infrastructure components.

compliance-status: Compliant
test-results: UDS ensures that all vulnerability scanning software that requires
  privileged access to information system components is done following least
  privilege and done in a controlled manner through a specific role. For example
  if an authenticated scan is required a non-human service account will be used
  to complete the task.
