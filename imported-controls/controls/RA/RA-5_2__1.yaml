control-acronym: RA-5(2)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization updates the information system vulnerabilities scanned
  [Selection (one or more): [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; prior
  to a new scan; when new vulnerabilities are identified and reported].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related controls: SI-3, SI-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Procedures addressing vulnerability scanning; security
  plan; security assessment report; vulnerability scanning tools and associated
  configuration documentation; vulnerability scanning results; patch and
  vulnerability management records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with vulnerability scanning
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with vulnerability scan analysis
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for vulnerability scanning;
  automated mechanisms/tools supporting and/or implementing vulnerability
  scanning].

cci-definition: '001063: The organization updates the information system
  vulnerabilities scanned on an organization-defined frequency, prior to a new
  scan and/or when new vulnerabilities are identified and reported.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will update the list of information
  system vulnerabilities scanned for prior to running scans. The organization
  must maintain a record of scans including the list of vulnerabilities scanned
  for. DoD has defined the frequency as prior to running scans.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation that scanning tool being used is up to date.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the record of scans to ensure the latest most up to date
  scanning policies are present.
