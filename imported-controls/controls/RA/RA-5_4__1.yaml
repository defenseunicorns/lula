control-acronym: RA-5(4)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization determines what information about the information system is
  discoverable by adversaries and subsequently takes [Assignment:
  organization-defined corrective actions].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Discoverable information includes information that adversaries could obtain
  without directly compromising or breaching the information system, for
  example, by collecting information the system is exposing or by conducting
  extensive searches of the web. Corrective actions can include, for example,
  notifying appropriate organizational personnel, removing designated
  information, or changing the information system to make designated information
  less relevant or attractive to adversaries. Related control: AU-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Procedures addressing vulnerability scanning; security
  assessment report; penetration test results; vulnerability scanning results;
  risk assessment report; records of corrective actions taken; incident response
  records; audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with vulnerability scanning
  and/or penetration testing responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  vulnerability scan analysis responsibilities; organizational personnel
  responsible for risk response; organizational personnel responsible for
  incident management and response; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for vulnerability scanning;
  organizational processes for risk response; organizational processes for
  incident management and response; automated mechanisms/tools supporting and/or
  implementing vulnerability scanning; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing risk response; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing incident management and response].

implementation-guidance: >-
  If the organization being inspected/assessed is conducting vulnerability scans
  IAW base control RA-5, they are compliant with this CCI.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP).

  2.) Reference to system security plan (SSP) section pertaining to procedure to
  discover what information may have been compromised in the event of a breach.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  will review results of validation of base control RA-5, if the inspected
  organization is compliant with the requirements of RA-5, they are compliant
  with this CCI.
