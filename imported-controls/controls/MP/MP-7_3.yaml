control-acronym: MP-7
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization [Selection: restricts; prohibits] the use of [Assignment:
  organization-defined types of information system media] on [Assignment:
  organization-defined information systems or system components] using
  [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital
  media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable
  hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks.
  Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. This control
  also applies to mobile devices with information storage capability (e.g.,
  smart phones, tablets, E-readers). In contrast to MP-2, which restricts user
  access to media, this control restricts the use of certain types of media on
  information systems, for example, restricting/prohibiting the use of flash
  drives or external hard disk drives. Organizations can employ technical and
  nontechnical safeguards (e.g., policies, procedures, rules of behavior) to
  restrict the use of information system media. Organizations may restrict the
  use of portable storage devices, for example, by using physical cages on
  workstations to prohibit access to certain external ports, or
  disabling/removing the ability to insert, read or write to such devices.
  Organizations may also limit the use of portable storage devices to only
  approved devices including, for example, devices provided by the organization,
  devices provided by other approved organizations, and devices that are not
  personally owned. Finally, organizations may restrict the use of portable
  storage devices based on the type of device, for example, prohibiting the use
  of writeable, portable storage devices, and implementing this restriction by
  disabling or removing the capability to write to such devices. Related
  controls: AC-19, PL-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system media protection policy; system use
  policy; procedures addressing media usage restrictions; security plan; rules
  of behavior; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  media use responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for media use; automated
  mechanisms restricting or prohibiting use of information system media on
  information systems or system components].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP
  Moderate Baseline, Rev 4

cci-definition: '002583: The organization defines the security safeguards to use
  for restricting or prohibiting the use of organization-defined types of
  information system media on organization-defined information systems or system
  components.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the security
  safeguards to use for restricting or prohibiting the use of
  organization-defined types of information system media on organization-defined
  information systems or system components. DoD has determined the security
  safeguards are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP or TTP, referencing section that defines security
  safeguards
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented security safeguards to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed defines the security safeguards to use
  for restricting or prohibiting the use of organization-defined types of
  information system media on organization-defined information systems or system
  components. DoD has determined the security safeguards are not appropriate to
  define at the Enterprise level.
