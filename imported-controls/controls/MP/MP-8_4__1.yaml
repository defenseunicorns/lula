control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization downgrades information system media containing classified
  information prior to release to individuals without required access
  authorizations in accordance with NSA standards and policies.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Downgrading of classified information uses approved sanitization tools,
  techniques, and procedures to transfer information confirmed to be
  unclassified from classified information systems to unclassified media.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system media protection policy; access
  authorization policy; procedures addressing downgrading of media containing
  classified information; procedures addressing handling of classified
  information; NSA standards and policies regarding protection of classified
  information; media downgrading records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  media downgrading responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for media downgrading; automated
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing media downgrading].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed implements a process to downgrade
  information system media containing classified information prior to release to
  individuals without required access authorizations in accordance with NSA
  standards and policies. The organization must maintain a record of release of
  media containing classified information and a record of information system
  media downgrade.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP or TTP addressing the release of information system
  media to individuals without required access authorizations
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the record of release of media containing classified
  information as well as records of information system media downgrade to ensure
  the organization being inspected/assessed implements a process to downgrade
  information system media containing classified information prior to release to
  individuals without required access authorizations in accordance with NSA
  standards and policies.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (A system media
  downgrading process will typically be specific to the hardware which UDS is
  installed on or external media policy and procedures for the organization. See
  the hardware manufacturers volatility of memory report.)
