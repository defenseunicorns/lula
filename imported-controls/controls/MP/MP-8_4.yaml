control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Establishes [Assignment: organization-defined information system media
  downgrading process] that includes employing downgrading mechanisms with
  [Assignment: organization-defined strength and integrity];

  b. Ensures that the information system media downgrading process is
  commensurate with the security category and/or classification level of the
  information to be removed and the access authorizations of the potential
  recipients of the downgraded information;

  c. Identifies [Assignment: organization-defined information system media
  requiring downgrading]; and

  d. Downgrades the identified information system media using the established
  process.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies to all information system media, digital and non-digital,
  subject to release outside of the organization, whether or not the media is
  considered removable. The downgrading process, when applied to system media,
  removes information from the media, typically by security category or
  classification level, such that the information cannot be retrieved or
  reconstructed. Downgrading of media includes redacting information to enable
  wider release and distribution. Downgrading of media also ensures that empty
  space on the media (e.g., slack space within files) is devoid of information.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system media protection policy; procedures
  addressing media downgrading; system categorization documentation; list of
  media requiring downgrading; records of media downgrading; audit records;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  media downgrading responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for media downgrading; automated
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing media downgrading].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines, identifies, and documents
  the information system media requiring downgrading. DoD has determined the
  information system media is not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP or TTP, referencing section that identifies and
  defines the information system media requiring downgrading
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented information system media to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed defines and identifies the information
  system media requiring downgrading. DoD has determined the information system
  media is not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (A system media
  downgrading process will typically be specific to the hardware which UDS is
  installed on or external media policy and procedures for the organization. See
  the hardware manufacturers volatility of memory report.)
