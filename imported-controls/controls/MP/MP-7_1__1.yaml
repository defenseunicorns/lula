control-acronym: MP-7(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization prohibits the use of portable storage devices in
  organizational information systems when such devices have no identifiable
  owner.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Requiring identifiable owners (e.g., individuals, organizations, or projects)
  for portable storage devices reduces the risk of using such technologies by
  allowing organizations to assign responsibility and accountability for
  addressing known vulnerabilities in the devices (e.g., malicious code
  insertion). Related control: PL-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system media protection policy; system use
  policy; procedures addressing media usage restrictions; security plan; rules
  of behavior; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  media use responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for media use; automated
  mechanisms prohibiting use of media on information systems or system
  components].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP
  Moderate Baseline, Rev 4

cci-definition: '002585: The organization prohibits the use of portable storage
  devices in organization information systems when such devices have no
  identifiable owner.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed does not use portable storage
  devices in organization information systems when such devices have no
  identifiable owner.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP or TTP, referencing section which prohibits portable
  storage for devices with no identifiable owner
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines a sampling of portable storage devices used in the information system
  to ensure that the devices have an identifiable owner.
