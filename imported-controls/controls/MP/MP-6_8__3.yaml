control-acronym: MP-6(8)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization provides the capability to purge/wipe information from
  [Assignment: organization-defined information systems, system components, or
  devices] either remotely or under the following conditions: [Assignment:
  organization-defined conditions].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement protects data/information on organizational
  information systems, system components, or devices (e.g., mobile devices) if
  such systems, components, or devices are obtained by unauthorized individuals.
  Remote purge/wipe commands require strong authentication to mitigate the risk
  of unauthorized individuals purging/wiping the system/component/device. The
  purge/wipe function can be implemented in a variety of ways including, for
  example, by overwriting data/information multiple times or by destroying the
  key necessary to decrypt encrypted data.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system media protection policy; procedures
  addressing media sanitization and disposal; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; media sanitization records; audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  media sanitization responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for purging/wiping media;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing purge/wipe capabilities].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to purge /wipe information from information systems, system components, or
  devices defined in MP-6 (8), CCI 2575 either remotely or under conditions
  defined in MP-6 (8), CCI 2576.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP or TTP enabling the purging/wiping of
  organization-defined information systems
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed provides the capability to purge /wipe information from
  information systems, system components, or devices defined in MP-6 (8), CCI
  2575 either remotely or under conditions defined in MP-6 (8), CCI 2576.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS does not have a
  remote or secure wipe function and would require the device to be wiped by
  third party tool integrated with UDS.)
