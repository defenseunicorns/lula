  Description:

  The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined operations security
  safeguards] to protect key organizational information throughout the system
  development life cycle.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Operations security (OPSEC) is a systematic process by which potential
  adversaries can be denied information about the capabilities and intentions of
  organizations by identifying, controlling, and protecting generally
  unclassified information that specifically relates to the planning and
  execution of sensitive organizational activities. The OPSEC process involves
  five steps: (i) identification of critical information (e.g., the security
  categorization process); (ii) analysis of threats; (iii) analysis of
  vulnerabilities; (iv) assessment of risks; and (v) the application of
  appropriate countermeasures. OPSEC safeguards are applied to both
  organizational information systems and the environments in which those systems
  operate. OPSEC safeguards help to protect the confidentiality of key
  information including, for example, limiting the sharing of information with
  suppliers and potential suppliers of information system components,
  information technology products and services, and with other
  non-organizational elements and individuals. Information critical to
  mission/business success includes, for example, user identities, element uses,
  suppliers, supply chain processes, functional and security requirements,
  system design specifications, testing protocols, and security control
  implementation details. Related controls: RA-2, RA-5, SA-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing operations security; security plan; list of operations security
  safeguards; security control assessments; risk assessments; threat and
  vulnerability assessments; plans of action and milestones; system development
  life cycle documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  information system developers/integrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for protecting organizational
  information throughout the SDLC; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing safeguards to protect organizational information throughout the
  SDLC].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed implements operations security
  safeguards defined in SC-38, CCI 2528 to protect key organizational
  information throughout the system development life cycle. The organization
  must maintain an audit trail of security safeguard implementation.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).

  2.) Concept of Operations (CONOP).

  3.) System security plan (SSP) (reference "security" section).
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the audit trail of security safeguard implementation to
  ensure the organization being inspected/assessed employs operations security
  safeguards defined in SC-38, CCI 2528 to protect key organizational
  information throughout the system development life cycle.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (These controls pertain to
  organizational policies, procedures, and processes implemented throughout the
  system development life cycle (SDLC), rather than specific technical
  safeguards provided by the UDS platform itself. While UDS facilitates secure
  development through secure components and best practices (such as IaC, secure
  deployment with Zarf, and integrated security tools like NeuVector), defining
  and employing operational security (OPSEC) safeguards during the development
  lifecycle (e.g., personnel procedures, secure coding practices, information
  handling policies) remains an organizational responsibility. UDS provides a
  secure deployment and operational foundation, but actual OPSEC safeguards must
  be defined, implemented, and documented at the organizational policy and
  procedural level outside the UDS core platform.
