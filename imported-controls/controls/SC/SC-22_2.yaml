control-acronym: SC-22
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information systems that collectively provide name/address resolution
  service for an organization are fault-tolerant and implement internal/external
  role separation.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information systems that provide name and address resolution services include,
  for example, domain name system (DNS) servers. To eliminate single points of
  failure and to enhance redundancy, organizations employ at least two
  authoritative domain name system servers, one configured as the primary server
  and the other configured as the secondary server. Additionally, organizations
  typically deploy the servers in two geographically separated network
  subnetworks (i.e., not located in the same physical facility). For role
  separation, DNS servers with internal roles only process name and address
  resolution requests from within organizations (i.e., from internal clients).
  DNS servers with external roles only process name and address resolution
  information requests from clients external to organizations (i.e., on external
  networks including the Internet). Organizations specify clients that can
  access authoritative DNS servers in particular roles (e.g., by address ranges,
  explicit lists). Related controls: SC-2, SC-20, SC-21, SC-24.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing architecture and provisioning for name/address resolution service;
  access control policy and procedures; information system design documentation;
  assessment results from independent, testing organizations; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; information system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with responsibilities for managing DNS].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  name/address resolution service for fault tolerance and role separation].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed implements a name service resolution
  architecture where recursive and authoritative server software is not
  installed on the same information system. The organization must document the
  architecture in the site security plan. For information system components that
  have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 1183.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System Security Plan (SSP).

  2.) Network Diagram.

  3.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks pertaining to CCI 1183.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  reviews the sites implementation documentation of the name resolution servers
  and verifies authoritative and recursive services are not hosted on the same
  information system. For information system components that have applicable
  STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates
  the components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 1183.
