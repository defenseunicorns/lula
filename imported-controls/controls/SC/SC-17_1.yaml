control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization issues public key certificates under an [Assignment:
  organization-defined certificate policy] or obtains public key certificates
  from an approved service provider.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  For all certificates, organizations manage information system trust stores to
  ensure only approved trust anchors are in the trust stores. This control
  addresses both certificates with visibility external to organizational
  information systems and certificates related to the internal operations of
  systems, for example, application-specific time services. Related control:
  SC-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing public key infrastructure certificates; public key certificate
  policy or policies; public key issuing process; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with responsibilities for issuing public key certificates; service providers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the
  management of public key infrastructure certificates].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  issue public key certificates under DoDI 8520.02, "Public Key Infrastructure
  (PKI) and Public Key (PK) Enabling" or obtains public key certificates from an
  approved service provider. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 1159. DoD has defined
  the certificate policy as DoDI 8520.02, "Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and
  Public Key (PK) Enabling."

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1. Signed and dated System Security Plan that verifies and validates that the
  site configures their information system to issue public key certificates
  according to DoDI 8520.02, "Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Public Key
  (PK) Enabling.".
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to issue public key
  certificates under DoDI 8520.02, "Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Public
  Key (PK) Enabling" or obtains public key certificates from an approved service
  provider. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the
  components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 1159. DoD has defined the certificate policy as DoDI
  8520.02, "Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Public Key (PK) Enabling."

test-results: UDS leverages the Istio Service Mesh for internal secure
  communications, which issues and manages short-lived X.509 public key
  certificates internally using its embedded certificate authority (Citadel) for
  mutual TLS (mTLS) between services. By default, this built-in certificate
  management follows industry best practices. The organization might require the
  use of a specific certificate or a DoD-approved external PKI service provider
  but UDS supports integration with external approved PKI providers for issuing
  and validating user certificates.
