control-acronym: SC-7(9)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system:

  (a) Detects and denies outgoing communications traffic posing a threat to
  external information systems; and

  (b) Audits the identity of internal users associated with denied
  communications.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Detecting outgoing communications traffic from internal actions that may pose
  threats to external information systems is sometimes termed extrusion
  detection. Extrusion detection at information system boundaries as part of
  managed interfaces includes the analysis of incoming and outgoing
  communications traffic searching for indications of internal threats to the
  security of external systems. Such threats include, for example, traffic
  indicative of denial of service attacks and traffic containing malicious code.
  Related controls: AU-2, AU-6, SC-38, SC-44, SI-3, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; information system design documentation;
  information system hardware and software; information system architecture;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing boundary protection
  capability; automated mechanisms implementing detection and denial of
  threatening outgoing communications traffic; automated mechanisms implementing
  auditing of outgoing communications traffic].

cci: 2400
cci-definition: '002400: The information system audits the identity of internal
  users associated with denied outgoing communications traffic posing a threat
  to external information systems.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  audit the identity of internal users associated with denied outgoing
  communications traffic posing a threat to external information systems. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 2400.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Organization configuration documentation for the information system to
  audit the identity of internal users associated with denied outgoing
  communications traffic posing a threat to external information systems

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.

  3.) Applicable firewall rule set.

  4.) Applicable firewall logs.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to audit the identity of
  internal users associated with denied outgoing communications traffic posing a
  threat to external information systems. For information system components that
  have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 2400.
