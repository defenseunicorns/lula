control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system maintains the [Selection (one or more):
  confidentiality; integrity] of information during preparation for transmission
  and during reception.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information can be either unintentionally or maliciously disclosed or modified
  during preparation for transmission or during reception including, for
  example, during aggregation, at protocol transformation points, and during
  packing/unpacking. These unauthorized disclosures or modifications compromise
  the confidentiality or integrity of the information. Related control: AU-10.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing transmission confidentiality and integrity; information system
  design documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  transmission confidentiality and/or integrity].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  maintain the confidentiality and integrity of information during reception.
  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 2422. DoD has defined the selection as both
  confidentiality and integrity.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks pertaining to CCI 2422.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to maintain the
  confidentiality and integrity of information during reception. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization
  conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that
  the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the information
  system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI
  2422.

test-results: UDS system employs a multi-layered approach to ensure that
  information remains confidential and unaltered during reception. Data arriving
  through controlled ingress points such as the Istio Ingress Gateway is
  transmitted over TLS-encrypted channels, preventing interception and
  maintaining confidentiality. Upon receipt, cryptographic checks (including
  digital signature validation and checksum verification) confirm the data's
  integrity, ensuring it has not been tampered with in transit. Keycloak and
  AuthService work together to verify the identity of the sender.
