control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system fails securely in the event of an operational failure
  of a boundary protection device.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Fail secure is a condition achieved by employing information system mechanisms
  to ensure that in the event of operational failures of boundary protection
  devices at managed interfaces (e.g., routers, firewalls, guards, and
  application gateways residing on protected subnetworks commonly referred to as
  demilitarized zones), information systems do not enter into unsecure states
  where intended security properties no longer hold. Failures of boundary
  protection devices cannot lead to, or cause information external to the
  devices to enter the devices, nor can failures permit unauthorized information
  releases. Related controls: CP-2, SC-24.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; information system design documentation;
  information system architecture; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing secure
  failure].

  an operational failure of a boundary protection device.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  fail securely in the event of an operational failure of a boundary protection
  device. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs,
  the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG
  guidance that pertains to CCI 1126.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Organization configuration documentation for the information system to
  prevent discovery of specific system components composing a managed interface.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to fail securely in the
  event of an operational failure of a boundary protection device. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 1126.
