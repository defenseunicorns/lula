control-acronym: SC-8
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system protects the [Selection (one or more): confidentiality;
  integrity] of transmitted information.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies to both internal and external networks and all types of
  information system components from which information can be transmitted (e.g.,
  servers, mobile devices, notebook computers, printers, copiers, scanners,
  facsimile machines). Communication paths outside the physical protection of a
  controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and
  modification. Protecting the confidentiality and/or integrity of
  organizational information can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., by
  employing protected distribution systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing
  encryption techniques). Organizations relying on commercial providers offering
  transmission services as commodity services rather than as fully dedicated
  services (i.e., services which can be highly specialized to individual
  customer needs), may find it difficult to obtain the necessary assurances
  regarding the implementation of needed security controls for transmission
  confidentiality/integrity. In such situations, organizations determine what
  types of confidentiality/integrity services are available in standard,
  commercial telecommunication service packages. If it is infeasible or
  impractical to obtain the necessary security controls and assurances of
  control effectiveness through appropriate contracting vehicles, organizations
  implement appropriate compensating security controls or explicitly accept the
  additional risk. Related controls: AC-17, PE-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing transmission confidentiality and integrity; information system
  design documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  transmission confidentiality and/or integrity].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  protect the confidentiality and/or integrity of transmitted information. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 2418.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Current Network diagram.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks pertaining to CCI 2418.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to protect the
  confidentiality and/or integrity of transmitted information. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization
  conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that
  the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the information
  system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI
  2418.

test-results: 'UDS ensures the confidentiality and integrity of all data in
  transit using encryption. Istio mTLS by default encrypts service-to-service
  communication within the clusterâ, meaning internal API calls or data
  exchanges are always over TLS (with modern ciphers), protecting them from
  eavesdropping or tampering. For data entering or leaving the cluster, UDS
  relies on TLS as well. The Istio Ingress gateway is usually configured with
  HTTPS (TLS) for incoming connections from users. Keycloakâs endpoints (for
  authentication) are accessed via HTTPS. If the cluster calls out to an
  external API, the recommendation and typical setup is to use TLS for those
  calls too (and Istio can enforce TLS origination if needed).'
