control-acronym: SC-7(5)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system at managed interfaces denies network communications
  traffic by default and allows network communications traffic by exception
  (i.e., deny all, permit by exception).


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement applies to both inbound and outbound network
  communications traffic. A deny-all, permit-by-exception network communications
  traffic policy ensures that only those connections which are essential and
  approved are allowed.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing traffic management at
  managed interfaces].

cci-definition: '001109: The information system at managed interfaces denies
  network communications traffic by default and allows network communications
  traffic by exception (i.e., deny all, permit by exception).'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  deny network communications traffic at managed interfaces by default and
  allows network communications traffic by exception (i.e., deny all, permit by
  exception). For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG
  guidance that pertains to CCI 1109.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Current Network diagram.

  2.) Applicable firewall rule set.

  3.) Applicable firewall logs.

  4.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to deny network
  communications traffic at managed interfaces by default and allows network
  communications traffic by exception (i.e., deny all, permit by exception). For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 1109.
