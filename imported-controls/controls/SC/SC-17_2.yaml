control-acronym: SC-17
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization issues public key certificates under an [Assignment:
  organization-defined certificate policy] or obtains public key certificates
  from an approved service provider.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  For all certificates, organizations manage information system trust stores to
  ensure only approved trust anchors are in the trust stores. This control
  addresses both certificates with visibility external to organizational
  information systems and certificates related to the internal operations of
  systems, for example, application-specific time services. Related control:
  SC-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing public key infrastructure certificates; public key certificate
  policy or policies; public key issuing process; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with responsibilities for issuing public key certificates; service providers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the
  management of public key infrastructure certificates].
