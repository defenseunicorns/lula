control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to prevent
  unauthorized disclosure and modification of [Assignment: organization-defined
  information] on [Assignment: organization-defined information system
  components].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect the
  confidentiality and integrity of organizational information. The strength of
  mechanism is commensurate with the security category and/or classification of
  the information. This control enhancement applies to significant
  concentrations of digital media in organizational areas designated for media
  storage and also to limited quantities of media generally associated with
  information system components in operational environments (e.g., portable
  storage devices, mobile devices). Organizations have the flexibility to either
  encrypt all information on storage devices (i.e., full disk encryption) or
  encrypt specific data structures (e.g., files, records, or fields).
  Organizations employing cryptographic mechanisms to protect information at
  rest also consider cryptographic key management solutions. Related controls:
  AC-19, SC-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of
  information at rest defined in SC-28 (1), CCI 2473 on any information system
  components storing data defined in SC-28 (1), 2473. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  2476. DoD has defined the information system components as any information
  system components storing data defined in SC-28 (1), 2473.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks pertains to CCI 2476.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to implement
  cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information at
  rest defined in SC-28 (1), CCI 2473 on any information system components
  storing data defined in SC-28 (1), 2473. For information system components
  that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 2476. DoD has defined the
  information system components as any information system components storing
  data defined in SC-28 (1), 2473.

test-results: 'In UDS, cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to secure
  sensitive information at rest on designated system components, preventing
  unauthorized disclosure in line with organization-defined policies. For
  instance, Kubernetes Secrets storing credentials and certificatesâare
  encrypted at rest using etcd encryption and protected with strict RBAC
  controls, while persistent storage volumes can be configured with
  industry-standard encryption algorithms such as AES-256. Velero backups can be
  stored on encrypted media, and Zarfâs packaging process employs
  cryptographic signing to ensure the integrity and authenticity of software
  components. This layered approach, which also extends to log storage and other
  data repositories, leverages approved cryptographic standards to maintain
  confidentiality across the entire UDS environment.'
