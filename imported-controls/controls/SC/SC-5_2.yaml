control-acronym: SC-5
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system protects against or limits the effects of the following
  types of denial of service attacks: [Assignment: organization-defined types of
  denial of service attacks or reference to source for such information] by
  employing [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A variety of technologies exist to limit, or in some cases, eliminate the
  effects of denial of service attacks. For example, boundary protection devices
  can filter certain types of packets to protect information system components
  on internal organizational networks from being directly affected by denial of
  service attacks. Employing increased capacity and bandwidth combined with
  service redundancy may also reduce the susceptibility to denial of service
  attacks. Related controls: SC-6, SC-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing denial of service protection; information system design
  documentation; security plan; list of denial of services attacks requiring
  employment of security safeguards to protect against or limit effects of such
  attacks; list of security safeguards protecting against or limiting the
  effects of denial of service attacks; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with incident response responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms protecting against or limiting the
  effects of denial of service attacks].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  protect against or limits the effects of types of denial of service attacks
  defined in SC-5, CCI 1093 by employing security safeguards defined in SC-5,
  CCI 2386. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG
  guidance that pertains to CCI 2385.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Configuration documentation on how organization configures the information
  system to protect against or limits the effects of types of DoS attacks
  defined in SC-5, CCI 1093 by employing security safeguards defined in SC-5,
  CCI 2386.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to protect against or
  limits the effects of types of denial of service attacks defined in SC-5, CCI
  1093 by employing security safeguards defined in SC-5, CCI 2386. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 2385.
