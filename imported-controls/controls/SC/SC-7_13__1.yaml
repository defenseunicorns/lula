control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization isolates [Assignment: organization-defined information
  security tools, mechanisms, and support components] from other internal
  information system components by implementing physically separate subnetworks
  with managed interfaces to other components of the system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Physically separate subnetworks with managed interfaces are useful, for
  example, in isolating computer network defenses from critical operational
  processing networks to prevent adversaries from discovering the analysis and
  forensics techniques of organizations. Related controls: SA-8, SC-2, SC-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; information system design documentation;
  information system hardware and software; information system architecture;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation; list
  of security tools and support components to be isolated from other internal
  information system components; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  isolation of information security tools, mechanisms, and support components].

  The organization being inspected/assessed designs the information system to
  isolate key information security tools, mechanisms, and support components
  such as, but not limited to PKI, Patching infrastructure, HBSS, CND Tools,
  Special Purpose Gateway, vulnerability tracking systems, honeypots, internet
  access points (IAPs); network element and data center
  administrative/management traffic; Demilitarized Zones (DMZs), Server
  farms/computing centers, centralized audit log servers etc. from other
  internal information system components by implementing physically separate
  subnetworks with managed interfaces to other components of the system. DoD has
  defined the key information security tools, mechanisms, and support components
  as key information security tools, mechanisms, and support components such as,

  1.) Current network topology diagrams.

  2.) Architecture documentation or any other relevant documentation.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines network topology diagrams, architecture documentation, or
  any other documentation identifying component partitioning to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed isolates key information security tools,
  mechanisms, and support components such as, but not limited to PKI, Patching
  infrastructure, HBSS, CND Tools, Special Purpose Gateway, vulnerability
  tracking systems, honeypots, internet access points (IAPs); network element

test-results: 'In UDS, isolation of security tools and support components is
  achieved by deploying them into dedicated environments using separate
  Kubernetes namespaces and, where the underlying infrastructure permits,
  physically separate subnetworks with controlled interfaces. Critical security
  services like Keycloak, NeuVector, and the Istio control plane are isolated
  from general application workloads through strict network segmentation and
  managed access points, ensuring that communications between these components
  and other system elements occur only through predefined, secure channels. This
  approach is enforced via Infrastructure as Code (using OpenTofu and Zarf),
  which codifies and consistently deploys these boundaries, thereby reducing the
  attack surface and safeguarding the integrity of the organizationâs core
  security functions.'
