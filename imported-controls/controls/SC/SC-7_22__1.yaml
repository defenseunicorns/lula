control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system implements separate network addresses (i.e., different
  subnets) to connect to systems in different security domains.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Decomposition of information systems into subnets helps to provide the
  appropriate level of protection for network connections to different security
  domains containing information with different security categories or
  classification levels.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; information system design documentation;
  information system hardware and software; information system architecture;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  separate network addresses/different subnets].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed designs the information system to
  implement separate network addresses (i.e., different subnets) to connect to
  systems in different security domains.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Current network topology diagrams.

  2.) Architecture documentation.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines network topology diagrams, architecture documentation, or
  any other documentation identifying component partitioning to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed implements separate network addresses
  (i.e., different subnets) to connect to systems in different security domains.

test-results: UDS leverages the underlying Kubernetes networking model and the
  Istio service mesh to logically separate connections to different security
  domains by assigning distinct network addresses and subnetworks (via
  Kubernetes namespaces, service CIDR ranges, and network policies). Kubernetes
  Namespaces are assigned distinct logical subnet ranges, effectively segmenting
  workloads associated with different security domains. Istio enforces strong
  boundary controls through its ingress and egress gateways, controlling
  communication flow between namespaces (subnets) and external networks. Istio
  gateways explicitly define which systems can communicate across security
  domains. While UDS inherently implements logical network segmentation at the
  software-defined networking layer (rather than at the traditional physical
  subnet layer), the intent of isolating different security domains via
  separate, clearly defined network addressing is effectively satisfied through
  these combined Kubernetes and Istio mechanisms.
