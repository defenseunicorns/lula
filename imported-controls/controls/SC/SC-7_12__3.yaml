  Description:

  The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined host-based
  boundary protection mechanisms] at [Assignment: organization-defined
  information system components].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Host-based boundary protection mechanisms include, for example, host-based
  firewalls. Information system components employing host-based boundary
  protection mechanisms include, for example, servers, workstations, and mobile
  devices.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; information system design documentation;
  boundary protection hardware and software; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with boundary protection responsibilities; information system users].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing host-based boundary
  protection capabilities].

  The organization being inspected/assessed implements McAfee Host Intrusion
  Prevention (HIPS) on all information system components. DoD has defined the
  host-based boundary protection mechanisms as McAfee Host Intrusion Prevention
  (HIPS). DoD has defined the information system components as all information
  system components.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Organization documentation on the implementation of Host Intrusion
  Prevention (HIPS) on all information system components.

  2.) Sampling of information system components to verify that the site only
  uses McAfee HIPS.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines a sampling of information system components to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed implements McAfee Host Intrusion
  Prevention (HIPS) on all information system components. DoD has defined the
  host-based boundary protection mechanisms as McAfee Host Intrusion Prevention
  (HIPS). DoD has defined the information system components as all information
  system components.

test-results: UDS enforces host-based boundary protection mechanisms through its
  integrated container security solution (NeuVector) and Kubernetes-native
  policy enforcement (Pepr). NeuVector acts as a container-level firewall,
  providing real-time enforcement of network boundaries by blocking unauthorized
  network connections and detecting anomalous behavior within containers. Pepr
  policies further reinforce boundary protection by controlling Kubernetes
  resource definitions and ensuring that configurations align with
  organizational standards, preventing unauthorized or insecure container
  deployments. Additionally, the Istio service mesh ensures secure
  service-to-service communications via mutual TLS (mTLS), establishing strong
  internal boundaries and minimizing unauthorized lateral movement. Together,
  these components implement robust host-based boundary protections
