control-acronym: SC-18(4)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system prevents the automatic execution of mobile code in
  [Assignment: organization-defined software applications] and enforces
  [Assignment: organization-defined actions] prior to executing the code.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Actions enforced before executing mobile code, include, for example, prompting
  users prior to opening electronic mail attachments. Preventing automatic
  execution of mobile code includes, for example, disabling auto execute
  features on information system components employing portable storage devices
  such as Compact Disks (CDs), Digital Video Disks (DVDs), and Universal Serial
  Bus (USB) devices.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing mobile code; mobile code usage restrictions; mobile code
  implementation policy and procedures; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation; list
  of software applications for which automatic execution of mobile code must be
  prohibited; list of actions required before execution of mobile code; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with responsibilities for managing mobile code].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms preventing automatic execution of
  unacceptable mobile code; automated mechanisms enforcing actions to be taken
  prior to the execution of the mobile code].

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically compliant.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed is automatically compliant with this
  CCI because they are covered at the DoD level.
