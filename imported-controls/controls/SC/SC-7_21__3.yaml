control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs boundary protection mechanisms to separate
  [Assignment: organization-defined information system components] supporting
  [Assignment: organization-defined missions and/or business functions].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations can isolate information system components performing different
  missions and/or business functions. Such isolation limits unauthorized
  information flows among system components and also provides the opportunity to
  deploy greater levels of protection for selected components. Separating system
  components with boundary protection mechanisms provides the capability for
  increased protection of individual components and to more effectively control
  information flows between those components. This type of enhanced protection
  limits the potential harm from cyber attacks and errors. The degree of
  separation provided varies depending upon the mechanisms chosen. Boundary
  protection mechanisms include, for example, routers, gateways, and firewalls
  separating system components into physically separate networks or subnetworks,
  cross-domain devices separating subnetworks, virtualization techniques, and
  encrypting information flows among system components using distinct encryption
  keys. Related controls: CA-9, SC-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; information system design documentation;
  information system hardware and software; enterprise architecture
  documentation; information system architecture; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; information system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the
  capability to separate information system components supporting organizational
  missions and/or business functions].

  The organization being inspected/assessed designs the information system to
  employ boundary protection mechanisms to separate information system
  components defined in SC-7 (21), CCI 2413 supporting missions and/or business
  functions defined in SC-7 (21), CCI 2414.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Current network topology diagrams.

  2.) Architecture documentation.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines network topology diagrams, architecture documentation, or
  any other documentation identifying component partitioning to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed employs boundary protection mechanisms
  to separate information system components defined in SC-7 (21), CCI 2413
  supporting missions and/or business functions defined in SC-7 (21), CCI 2414.

test-results: In UDS, boundary protection is achieved through a layered approach
  that separates components by function and mission. Kubernetes namespaces and
  network policies segment workloads so that components such as those handling
  authentication (Keycloak) operate within isolated environments. The Istio
  service mesh enforces strict service-to-service communication through mutual
  TLS and granular access control policies, ensuring that only authorized
  interactions occur between distinct functional areas. The modular deployment
  model using Zarf packages maintains clear separation of system components by
  packaging them with predefined, isolated configurations.
