  Description:

  The information system isolates security functions from nonsecurity functions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The information system isolates security functions from nonsecurity functions
  by means of an isolation boundary (implemented via partitions and domains).
  Such isolation controls access to and protects the integrity of the hardware,
  software, and firmware that perform those security functions. Information
  systems implement code separation (i.e., separation of security functions from
  nonsecurity functions) in a number of ways, including, for example, through
  the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For
  non-kernel code, security function isolation is often achieved through file
  system protections that serve to protect the code on disk, and address space
  protections that protect executing code. Information systems restrict access
  to security functions through the use of access control mechanisms and by
  implementing least privilege capabilities. While the ideal is for all of the
  code within the security function isolation boundary to only contain
  security-relevant code, it is sometimes necessary to include nonsecurity
  functions within the isolation boundary as an exception. Related controls:
  AC-3, AC-6, SA-4, SA-5, SA-8, SA-13, SC-2, SC-7, SC-39.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing security function isolation; list of security functions to be
  isolated from nonsecurity functions; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Separation of security functions from nonsecurity
  functions within the information system].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  isolate security functions from nonsecurity functions. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  1084.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to isolate security
  functions from nonsecurity functions. For information system components that
  have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 1084.

test-results: 'UDS isolates security functions from non-security functions. For
  instance, Keycloak (the authentication service) and NeuVector (the security
  monitoring/enforcement service) are dedicated security components that are
  kept separate from general business applications. Normal users have no direct
  access to modify or interfere with these components; only admins can interact
  with them through controlled interfaces. The clusterâs control plane
  (Kubernetes API, Istio control) is separate from the application workloads.
  This layered design ensures that security mechanisms (like access control
  decisions, encryption, auditing) cannot be bypassed or tampered with by
  less-privileged code. Additionally, UDSâs use of sidecars (Istioâs Envoy
  proxies) means security enforcement runs alongside each service in a dedicated
  process, which is again separate from the appâs process. If an app is
  compromised, the sidecar is still there to enforce network policy. All this
  demonstrates enforcement of security domains and isolation.'
