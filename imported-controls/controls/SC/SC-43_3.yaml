control-acronym: SC-43
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for [Assignment:
  organization-defined information system components] based on the potential to
  cause damage to the information system if used maliciously; and

  b. Authorizes, monitors, and controls the use of such components within the
  information system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information system components include hardware, software, or firmware
  components (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, mobile code, digital copiers,
  printers, scanners, optical devices, wireless technologies, mobile devices).
  Related controls: CM-6, SC-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing usage restrictions; usage restrictions; implementation policy and
  procedures; authorization records; information system monitoring records;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for authorizing, monitoring, and
  controlling use of components with usage restrictions; Automated mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing authorizing, monitoring, and controlling use of
  components with usage restrictions].

  organization-defined information system components which have the potential to
  cause damage to the information system if used maliciously.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to authorize the use of all information system components (through the use of
  an acceptable use agreement) which have the potential to cause damage to the
  information system if used maliciously. The organization must maintain an
  audit trail of authorizations. DoD has defined the information system
  components as all information system components (through the use of an
  acceptable use agreement). Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated service level agreements (SLA).

  2.) Signed and dated user agreement.

  3.) System security plan (SSP) (reference "usage" section).
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process as well as the audit trail of
  authorizations to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed authorizes
  the use of all information system components (through the use of an acceptable
  use agreement) which have the potential to cause damage to the information
  system if used maliciously. DoD has defined the information system components
  as all information system components (through the use of an acceptable use
  agreement).

compliance-status: Compliant
test-results: UDS strictly enforces software usage restrictions and usage of
  approved software components. Through the use of Zarf packages and
  Infrastructure as Code (OpenTofu), only vetted and explicitly defined
  components are included and deployed. Unauthorized or unapproved software
  cannot run on the platform due to enforcement mechanisms provided by Pepr
  policy engine and container-level security with NeuVector, which continuously
  scans for unauthorized images or software components. NeuVector will identify
  and block any malicious or unauthorized images, preventing execution of
  components outside the defined security boundary. These measures ensure strict
  adherence to organizational software usage policies, effectively mitigating
  risk from components or software not authorized by the organization,
