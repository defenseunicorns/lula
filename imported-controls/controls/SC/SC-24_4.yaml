control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system fails to a [Assignment: organization-defined
  known-state] for [Assignment: organization-defined types of failures]
  preserving [Assignment: organization-defined system state information] in
  failure.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Failure in a known state addresses security concerns in accordance with the
  mission/business needs of organizations. Failure in a known secure state helps
  to prevent the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of
  information in the event of failures of organizational information systems or
  system components. Failure in a known safe state helps to prevent systems from
  failing to a state that may cause injury to individuals or destruction to
  property. Preserving information system state information facilitates system
  restart and return to the operational mode of organizations with less
  disruption of mission/business processes. Related controls: CP-2, CP-10,
  CP-12, SC-7, SC-22.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing information system failure to known state; information system
  design documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; list of failures requiring information system to fail in a
  known state; state information to be preserved in system failure; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  fail-in-known state capability; automated mechanisms preserving system state
  information in the event of a system failure].

implementation-guidance: >-
  DoD has defined system state information as information necessary to determine
  cause of failure and to return to operations with least disruption to mission/
  business processes.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically compliant.
assessment-procedures: The organization being inspected/assessed is
  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined system state information as information necessary to
  determine cause of failure and to return to operations with least disruption
  to mission/ business processes.
