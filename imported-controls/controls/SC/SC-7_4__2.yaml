control-acronym: SC-7(4)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Implements a managed interface for each external telecommunication
  service;

  (b) Establishes a traffic flow policy for each managed interface;

  (c) Protects the confidentiality and integrity of the information being
  transmitted across each interface;

  (d) Documents each exception to the traffic flow policy with a supporting
  mission/business need and duration of that need; and

  (e) Reviews exceptions to the traffic flow policy [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] and removes exceptions that are no longer
  supported by an explicit mission/business need.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; traffic
  flow policy; information flow control policy; procedures addressing boundary
  protection; information system security architecture; information system
  design documentation; boundary protection hardware and software; information
  system architecture and configuration documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; records of traffic flow
  policy exceptions; information system audit records; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for documenting and reviewing
  exceptions to the traffic flow policy; organizational processes for removing
  exceptions to the traffic flow policy; automated mechanisms implementing
  boundary protection capability; managed interfaces implementing traffic flow
  policy].

cci-definition: '001103: The organization establishes a traffic flow policy for
  each managed interface for each external telecommunication service.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents a traffic flow
  policy for each managed interface for each external telecommunication service.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated traffic flow policy document for managed interfaces for
  each external telecommunication service.

  2.) Data flow diagram.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented traffic flow policy to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed establishes a traffic flow policy for
  each managed interface for each external telecommunication service.
