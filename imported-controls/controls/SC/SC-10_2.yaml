control-acronym: SC-10
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system terminates the network connection associated with a
  communications session at the end of the session or after [Assignment:
  organization-defined time period] of inactivity.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies to both internal and external networks. Terminating
  network connections associated with communications sessions include, for
  example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating
  system level, or de-allocating networking assignments at the application level
  if multiple application sessions are using a single, operating system-level
  network connection. Time periods of inactivity may be established by
  organizations and include, for example, time periods by type of network access
  or for specific network accesses.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing network disconnect; information system design documentation;
  security plan; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  network disconnect capability].

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically compliant.

  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the time period as 10 minutes in band management and 15
  minutes for user sessions.
