control-acronym: PS-4
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization, upon termination of individual employment:

  a. Disables information system access within [Assignment: organization-defined
  time period];

  b. Terminates/revokes any authenticators/credentials associated with the
  individual;

  c. Conducts exit interviews that include a discussion of [Assignment:
  organization-defined information security topics];

  d. Retrieves all security-related organizational information system-related
  property;

  e. Retains access to organizational information and information systems
  formerly controlled by terminated individual; and

  f. Notifies [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] within
  [Assignment: organization-defined time period].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information system-related property includes, for example, hardware
  authentication tokens, system administration technical manuals, keys,
  identification cards, and building passes. Exit interviews ensure that
  terminated individuals understand the security constraints imposed by being
  former employees and that proper accountability is achieved for information
  system-related property. Security topics of interest at exit interviews can
  include, for example, reminding terminated individuals of nondisclosure
  agreements and potential limitations on future employment. Exit interviews may
  not be possible for some terminated individuals, for example, in cases related
  to job abandonment, illnesses, and nonavailability of supervisors. Exit
  interviews are important for individuals with security clearances. Timely
  execution of termination actions is essential for individuals terminated for
  cause. In certain situations, organizations consider disabling the information
  system accounts of individuals that are being terminated prior to the
  individuals being notified. Related controls: AC-2, IA-4, PE-2, PS-5, PS-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Personnel security policy; procedures addressing
  personnel termination; records of personnel termination actions; list of
  information system accounts; records of terminated or revoked
  authenticators/credentials; records of exit interviews; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with personnel security
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for personnel termination;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing personnel termination
  notifications; automated mechanisms for disabling information system
  access/revoking authenticators].
