control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Screens individuals prior to authorizing access to the information system;
  and

  b. Rescreens individuals according to [Assignment: organization-defined
  conditions requiring rescreening and, where rescreening is so indicated, the
  frequency of such rescreening].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Personnel screening and rescreening activities reflect applicable federal
  laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
  guidance, and specific criteria established for the risk designations of
  assigned positions. Organizations may define different rescreening conditions
  and frequencies for personnel accessing information systems based on types of
  information processed, stored, or transmitted by the systems. Related
  controls: AC-2, IA-4, PE-2, PS-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Personnel security policy; procedures addressing
  personnel screening; records of screened personnel; security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with personnel security
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for personnel screening].

  information system.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Information system access list.

  2.) Sample of authorized users to manning documents.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the information system access list (AC-2) and compares a
  sampling of authorized users to manning documents (PS-2) to ensure access was
  granted appropriately IAW ADP/IT level designation requirements within DoD
  5200.2-R.
