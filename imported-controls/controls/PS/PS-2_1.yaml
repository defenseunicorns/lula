  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Assigns a risk designation to all organizational positions;

  b. Establishes screening criteria for individuals filling those positions; and

  c. Reviews and updates position risk designations [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Position risk designations reflect Office of Personnel Management policy and
  guidance. Risk designations can guide and inform the types of authorizations
  individuals receive when accessing organizational information and information
  systems. Position screening criteria include explicit information security
  role appointment requirements (e.g., training, security clearances). Related
  controls: AT-3, PL-2, PS-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Personnel security policy; procedures addressing
  position categorization; appropriate codes of federal regulations; list of
  risk designations for organizational positions; security plan; records of
  position risk designation reviews and updates; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with personnel security
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for assigning, reviewing, and
  updating position risk designations; organizational processes for establishing
  screening criteria].
