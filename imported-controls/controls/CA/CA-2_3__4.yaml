  Description:

  The organization accepts the results of an assessment of [Assignment:
  organization-defined information system] performed by [Assignment:
  organization-defined external organization] when the assessment meets
  [Assignment: organization-defined requirements].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations may often rely on assessments of specific information systems by
  other (external) organizations. Utilizing such existing assessments (i.e.,
  reusing existing assessment evidence) can significantly decrease the time and
  resources required for organizational assessments by limiting the amount of
  independent assessment activities that organizations need to perform. The
  factors that organizations may consider in determining whether to accept
  assessment results from external organizations can vary. Determinations for
  accepting assessment results can be based on, for example, past assessment
  experiences one organization has had with another organization, the reputation
  that organizations have with regard to assessments, the level of detail of
  supporting assessment documentation provided, or mandates imposed upon
  organizations by federal legislation, policies, or directives.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the
  requirements the assessments for organization-defined information systems from
  organization-defined external organizations must meet. DoD has determined the
  requirements are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Security Assessment Plan defining the requirements for
  the assessments for organizational- defined information systems from
  organization-defined external organizations.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examine the documented requirements to ensure the organization
  being inspected/assessed defines the requirements the assessments for
  organization-defined information systems from organization-defined external
  organizations must meet. DoD has determined the requirements are not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
