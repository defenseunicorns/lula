  Description:

  The organization accepts the results of an assessment of [Assignment:
  organization-defined information system] performed by [Assignment:
  organization-defined external organization] when the assessment meets
  [Assignment: organization-defined requirements].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations may often rely on assessments of specific information systems by
  other (external) organizations. Utilizing such existing assessments (i.e.,
  reusing existing assessment evidence) can significantly decrease the time and
  resources required for organizational assessments by limiting the amount of
  independent assessment activities that organizations need to perform. The
  factors that organizations may consider in determining whether to accept
  assessment results from external organizations can vary. Determinations for
  accepting assessment results can be based on, for example, past assessment
  experiences one organization has had with another organization, the reputation
  that organizations have with regard to assessments, the level of detail of
  supporting assessment documentation provided, or mandates imposed upon
  organizations by federal legislation, policies, or directives.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

cci-definition: '002066: The organization accepts the results of an assessment
  of the organization-defined information system performed by
  organization-defined external organization when the assessment meets
  organization-defined requirements.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed accepts the results of an assessment
  of the information system defined in CA-2 (3), CCI 2067 performed by external
  organization defined in CA-2 (3), CCI 2068 when the assessment meets
  requirements defined in CA-2 (3), CCI 2069. The organization must maintain
  records of acceptance or rejection of external organization assessment
  results.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Audit records to determine acceptance or rejection of external
  organization assessment results to ensure organization accepts the results of
  an assessment of the information system defined in CA-2 (3), CCI 2067
  performed by external organization defined in CA-2 (3), CCI 2068 when the
  assessment meets requirements defined in CA-2 (3), CCI 2069.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines a sampling of records of acceptance or rejection of
  external organization assessment results to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed accepts the results of an assessment of the information
  system defined in CA-2 (3), CCI 2067 performed by external organization
  defined in CA-2 (3), CCI 2068 when the assessment meets requirements defined
  in CA-2 (3), CCI 2069.
