control-acronym: CA-3(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization prohibits the direct connection of an [Assignment:
  organization-defined unclassified, national security system] to an external
  network without the use of [Assignment: organization-defined boundary
  protection device].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations typically do not have control over external networks (e.g., the
  Internet). Approved boundary protection devices (e.g., routers, firewalls)
  mediate communications (i.e., information flows) between unclassified national
  security systems and external networks. This control enhancement is required
  for organizations processing, storing, or transmitting Controlled Unclassified
  Information (CUI).


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing
  information system connections; system and communications protection policy;
  information system interconnection security agreements; security plan;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; security assessment report; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  managing direct connections to external networks; network administrators;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities; personnel
  managing directly connected external networks].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting the management of external
  network connections].

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically Compliant

  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the unclassified, national security systems as all
  unclassified NSS.
