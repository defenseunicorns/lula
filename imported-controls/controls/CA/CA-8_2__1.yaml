  Description:

  The organization employs [Assignment: organization-defined red team exercises]
  to simulate attempts by adversaries to compromise organizational information
  systems in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined rules of
  engagement].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Red team exercises extend the objectives of penetration testing by examining
  the security posture of organizations and their ability to implement effective
  cyber defenses. As such, red team exercises reflect simulated adversarial
  attempts to compromise organizational mission/business functions and provide a
  comprehensive assessment of the security state of information systems and
  organizations. Simulated adversarial attempts to compromise organizational
  missions/business functions and the information systems that support those
  missions/functions may include technology-focused attacks (e.g., interactions
  with hardware, software, or firmware components and/or mission/business
  processes) and social engineering-based attacks (e.g., interactions via email,
  telephone, shoulder surfing, or personal conversations). While penetration
  testing may be largely laboratory-based testing, organizations use red team
  exercises to provide more comprehensive assessments that reflect real-world
  conditions. Red team exercises can be used to improve security awareness and
  training and to assess levels of security control effectiveness.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

cci-definition: '002097: The organization defines red team exercises to simulate
  attempts by adversaries to compromise organizational information systems.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents red team
  exercises to simulate attempts by adversaries to compromise organizational
  information systems. DoD has determined the red team exercises are not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) SOP/TTP documenting red team exercises to simulate attempts by adversaries
  to compromise organizational information systems.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented red team exercises to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed defines red team exercises to simulate
  attempts by adversaries to compromise organizational information systems. DoD
  has determined the red team exercises are not appropriate to define at the
  Enterprise level.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The UDS technology stack
  does not conduct penetration testing or provide tools specifically for
  penetration testing. The responsibility for defining the frequency and
  conducting penetration testing on organization-defined information systems or
  system components lies with the organization. The organization must define and
  document the frequency for conducting penetration testing in accordance with
  their organizational requirements. This includes maintaining a record of
  penetration test results and ensuring that testing is conducted at the defined
  intervals.)
