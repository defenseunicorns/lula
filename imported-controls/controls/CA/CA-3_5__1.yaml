control-acronym: CA-3(5)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs [Selection: allow-all, deny-by-exception; deny-all,
  permit-by-exception] policy for allowing [Assignment: organization-defined
  information systems] to connect to external information systems.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations can constrain information system connectivity to external
  domains (e.g., websites) by employing one of two policies with regard to such
  connectivity: (i) allow-all, deny by exception, also known as blacklisting
  (the weaker of the two policies); or (ii) deny-all, allow by exception, also
  known as whitelisting (the stronger of the two policies). For either policy,
  organizations determine what exceptions, if any, are acceptable. Related
  control: CM-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing
  information system connections; system and communications protection policy;
  information system interconnection agreements; security plan; information
  system design documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; security assessment report; information system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  managing connections to external information systems; network administrators;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing restrictions on external
  system connections].

cci-definition: '002080: The organization employs either an allow-all, deny-by
  exception or deny-all, permit by exception policy for allowing
  organization-defined information systems to connect to external information
  systems.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  employ a deny-all, permit by exception policy for allowing any systems
  requiring external connectivity to connect to external information systems.
  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 2080. DoD has defined the information systems as any
  systems requiring external connectivity.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP documenting the (reference exception to policy
  section) configuration of information systems to employ a deny-all, permit by
  exception policy for allowing any systems requiring external connectivity to
  connect to external information systems.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to employ a deny-all,
  permit by exception policy for allowing any systems requiring external
  connectivity to connect to external information systems. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization
  conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that
  the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the information
  system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI
  2080. DoD has defined the information systems as any systems requiring
  external connectivity.
