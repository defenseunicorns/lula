control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Authorizes connections from the information system to other information
  systems through the use of Interconnection Security Agreements;

  b. Documents, for each interconnection, the interface characteristics,
  security requirements, and the nature of the information communicated; and

  c. Reviews and updates Interconnection Security Agreements [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies to dedicated connections between information systems
  (i.e., system interconnections) and does not apply to transitory,
  user-controlled connections such as email and website browsing. Organizations
  carefully consider the risks that may be introduced when information systems
  are connected to other systems with different security requirements and
  security controls, both within organizations and external to organizations.
  Authorizing officials determine the risk associated with information system
  connections and the appropriate controls employed. If interconnecting systems
  have the same authorizing official, organizations do not need to develop
  Interconnection Security Agreements. Instead, organizations can describe the
  interface characteristics between those interconnecting systems in their
  respective security plans. If interconnecting systems have different
  authorizing officials within the same organization, organizations can either
  develop Interconnection Security Agreements or describe the interface
  characteristics between systems in the security plans for the respective
  systems. Organizations may also incorporate Interconnection Security Agreement
  information into formal contracts, especially for interconnections established
  between federal agencies and nonfederal (i.e., private sector) organizations.
  Risk considerations also include information systems sharing the same
  networks. For certain technologies (e.g., space, unmanned aerial vehicles, and
  medical devices), there may be specialized connections in place during
  preoperational testing. Such connections may require Interconnection Security
  Agreements and be subject to additional security controls. Related controls:
  AC-3, AC-4, AC-20, AU-2, AU-12, AU-16, CA-7, IA-3, SA-9, SC-7, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing
  information system connections; system and communications protection policy;
  information system Interconnection Security Agreements; security plan;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  developing, implementing, or approving information system interconnection
  agreements; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; personnel managing the system(s) to which the
  Interconnection Security Agreement applies].

  Security Agreements on an organization-defined frequency.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed reviews and updates Interconnection
  Security Agreements at least annually. The organization must maintain an audit
  trail of reviews and updates. DoD has defined the frequency as at least
  annually.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Audit trail of reviews and updates to the Interconnection Security
  Agreements
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the audit trail of reviews and updates to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed reviews and updates Interconnection
  Security Agreements at least annually. DoD has defined the frequency as at
  least annually.

test-results: 'Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS can enforce
  technical controls on external system connections (as discussed in AC-20) â
  for example, only allowing connections to approved external services and using
  secure protocols. If UDS needs to connect with another system (like a data
  feed or identity service), those connections can be governed by configuration
  and monitored.. However, the requirement to obtain formal authorization for
  interconnection is an organizational responsibility. The stack itself cannot
  grant or record âinterconnection agreements;â it can only enforce security
  on the connection.)'
