control-acronym: CA-5
control-information: 'Description:

  The organization:

  a. Develops a plan of action and milestones for the information system to
  document the organizationâs planned remedial actions to correct weaknesses
  or deficiencies noted during the assessment of the security controls and to
  reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities in the system; and

  b. Updates existing plan of action and milestones [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] based on the findings from security controls
  assessments, security impact analyses, and continuous monitoring activities.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Plans of action and milestones are key documents in security authorization
  packages and are subject to federal reporting requirements established by OMB.
  Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, CM-4, PM-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security assessment and authorization policy;
  procedures addressing plan of action and milestones; security plan; security
  assessment plan; security assessment report; security assessment evidence;
  plan of action and milestones; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with plan of action and
  milestones development and implementation responsibilities; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms for developing, implementing, and
  maintaining plan of action and milestones].'

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will update the POA&M at least every
  90 days. The updates are to be based upon the assessment of the identified
  vulnerabilities and weaknesses, prioritization of the vulnerabilities and
  weaknesses, progress being made in addressing and resolving the security
  weaknesses and vulnerabilities found in programs and systems, and continuous
  monitoring activities. DoD has defined the frequency as at least every 90
  days.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Security Plan of Action and Milestones document with
  verification of document changes within
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines current POA&M. The objective is to validate the
  organization is providing updates to the POA&M at least every 90 days. Review
  of POA&M without change must be documented (i.e., adding review date to the
  POA&M header information). DoD has defined the frequency as at least every 90
  days.
