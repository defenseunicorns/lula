control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization prohibits the direct connection of an [Assignment:
  organization-defined information system] to a public network.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A public network is any network accessible to the general public including,
  for example, the Internet and organizational extranets with public access.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing
  information system connections; system and communications protection policy;
  information system interconnection security agreements; security plan;
  information system design documentation; ; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; security assessment report; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting the management of public
  network connections].

cci-definition: '002079: The organization defines the information system that is
  prohibited from directly connecting to a public network.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the
  information system that is prohibited from directly connecting to a public
  network. DoD has determined the information system is not appropriate to
  define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP defining the information system that is
  prohibited from directly connecting to a public network
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented information system to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed defines the information system that is
  prohibited from directly connecting to a public network. DoD has determined
  the information system is not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

test-results: 'Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS can enforce
  technical controls on external system connections (as discussed in AC-20) â
  for example, only allowing connections to approved external services and using
  secure protocols. If UDS needs to connect with another system (like a data
  feed or identity service), those connections can be governed by configuration
  and monitored.. However, the requirement to obtain formal authorization for
  interconnection is an organizational responsibility. The stack itself cannot
  grant or record âinterconnection agreements;â it can only enforce security
  on the connection.)'
