  Description:

  The organization employs assessors or assessment teams with [Assignment:
  organization-defined level of independence] to conduct security control
  assessments.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Independent assessors or assessment teams are individuals or groups who
  conduct impartial assessments of organizational information systems.
  Impartiality implies that assessors are free from any perceived or actual
  conflicts of interest with regard to the development, operation, or management
  of the organizational information systems under assessment or to the
  determination of security control effectiveness. To achieve impartiality,
  assessors should not: (i) create a mutual or conflicting interest with the
  organizations where the assessments are being conducted; (ii) assess their own
  work; (iii) act as management or employees of the organizations they are
  serving; or (iv) place themselves in positions of advocacy for the
  organizations acquiring their services. Independent assessments can be
  obtained from elements within organizations or can be contracted to public or
  private sector entities outside of organizations. Authorizing officials
  determine the required level of independence based on the security categories
  of information systems and/or the ultimate risk to organizational operations,
  organizational assets, or individuals. Authorizing officials also determine if
  the level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance that the
  results are sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based decisions. This
  includes determining whether contracted security assessment services have
  sufficient independence, for example, when information system owners are not
  directly involved in contracting processes or cannot unduly influence the
  impartiality of assessors conducting assessments. In special situations, for
  example, when organizations that own the information systems are small or
  organizational structures require that assessments are conducted by
  individuals that are in the developmental, operational, or management chain of
  system owners, independence in assessment processes can be achieved by
  ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by
  independent teams of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy,
  integrity, and reliability of the results. Organizations recognize that
  assessments performed for purposes other than direct support to authorization
  decisions are, when performed by assessors with sufficient independence, more
  likely to be useable for such decisions, thereby reducing the need to repeat
  assessments.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the level of
  independence for assessors or assessment teams to conduct security control
  assessments of organizational information systems. DoD has determined the
  level of independence is not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Security Assessment and Authorization Policy defining the
  level of independence for assessors or assessment teams to conduct security
  control assessments of organizational information systems.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented level of independence to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed defines the level of independence for
  assessors or assessment teams to conduct security control assessments of
  organizational information systems. DoD has determined the level of
  independence is not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
