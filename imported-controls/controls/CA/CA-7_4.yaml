  Description:

  The organization develops a continuous monitoring strategy and implements a
  continuous monitoring program that includes:

  a. Establishment of [Assignment: organization-defined metrics] to be
  monitored; 

  b. Establishment of [Assignment: organization-defined frequencies] for
  monitoring and [Assignment: organization-defined frequencies] for assessments
  supporting such monitoring;

  c. Ongoing security control assessments in accordance with the organizational
  continuous monitoring strategy;

  d. Ongoing security status monitoring of organization-defined metrics in
  accordance with the organizational continuous monitoring strategy;

  e. Correlation and analysis of security-related information generated by
  assessments and monitoring;

  f. Response actions to address results of the analysis of security-related
  information; and

  g. Reporting the security status of organization and the information system to
  [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Continuous monitoring programs facilitate ongoing awareness of threats,
  vulnerabilities, and information security to support organizational risk
  management decisions. The terms continuous and ongoing imply that
  organizations assess/analyze security controls and information
  security-related risks at a frequency sufficient to support organizational
  risk-based decisions. The results of continuous monitoring programs generate
  appropriate risk response actions by organizations. Continuous monitoring
  programs also allow organizations to maintain the security authorizations of
  information systems and common controls over time in highly dynamic
  environments of operation with changing mission/business needs, threats,
  vulnerabilities, and technologies. Having access to security-related
  information on a continuing basis through reports/dashboards gives
  organizational officials the capability to make more effective and timely risk
  management decisions, including ongoing security authorization decisions.
  Automation supports more frequent updates to security authorization packages,
  hardware/software/firmware inventories, and other system information.
  Effectiveness is further enhanced when continuous monitoring outputs are
  formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable, actionable,
  relevant, and timely. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in
  accordance with the security categories of information systems. Related
  controls: CA-2, CA-5, CA-6, CM-3, CM-4, PM-6, PM-9, RA-5, SA-11, SA-12, SI-2,
  SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security assessment and authorization policy;
  procedures addressing continuous monitoring of information system security
  controls; procedures addressing configuration management; security plan;

  monitoring records; configuration management records, security impact
