control-information: 'Description:

  The organization:

  a. Develops a plan of action and milestones for the information system to
  document the organizationâs planned remedial actions to correct weaknesses
  or deficiencies noted during the assessment of the security controls and to
  reduce or eliminate known vulnerabilities in the system; and

  b. Updates existing plan of action and milestones [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] based on the findings from security controls
  assessments, security impact analyses, and continuous monitoring activities.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Plans of action and milestones are key documents in security authorization
  packages and are subject to federal reporting requirements established by OMB.
  Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, CM-4, PM-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security assessment and authorization policy;
  procedures addressing plan of action and milestones; security plan; security
  assessment plan; security assessment report; security assessment evidence;
  plan of action and milestones; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with plan of action and
  milestones development and implementation responsibilities; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms for developing, implementing, and
  maintaining plan of action and milestones].'
