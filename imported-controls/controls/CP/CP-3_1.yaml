  Description:

  The organization provides contingency training to information system users
  consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities:

  a. Within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of assuming a
  contingency role or responsibility;

  b. When required by information system changes; and

  c. [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] thereafter.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Contingency training provided by organizations is linked to the assigned roles
  and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure that the
  appropriate content and level of detail is included in such training. For
  example, regular users may only need to know when and where to report for duty
  during contingency operations and if normal duties are affected; system
  administrators may require additional training on how to set up information
  systems at alternate processing and storage sites; and managers/senior leaders
  may receive more specific training on how to conduct mission-essential
  functions in designated off-site locations and how to establish communications
  with other governmental entities for purposes of coordination on
  contingency-related activities. Training for contingency
  roles/responsibilities reflects the specific continuity requirements in the
  contingency plan. Related controls: AT-2, AT-3, CP-2, IR-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  The organization being inspected/assessed provides initial contingency
  training to personnel with contingency roles and responsibilities IAW CP-2,
  CCI 449 at a maximum, 10 working days of assuming a contingency role or
  responsibility.

  The organization will maintain documentation of the training activity dates,
  location, and personnel for audit trail purposes and future reference (e.g.,
  scheduling refresher training, etc.).

  DoD has defined the time period as at a maximum, 10 working days.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) List of contingency personnel and documentation of initial contingency
  training
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the list of contingency personnel and documentation of
  initial contingency training for the purpose of ensuring that all personnel
  with contingency roles and responsibilities have received initial contingency
  training at a maximum, 10 working days of assuming a contingency role or
  responsibility. DoD has defined the time period as at a maximum, 10 working
  days.
