  Description:

  The organization plans for the resumption of essential missions and business
  functions within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of contingency
  plan activation.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations may choose to carry out the contingency planning activities in
  this control enhancement as part of organizational business continuity
  planning including, for example, as part of business impact analyses. The time
  period for resumption of essential missions/business functions may be
  dependent on the severity/extent of disruptions to the information system and
  its supporting infrastructure. Related control: PE-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
