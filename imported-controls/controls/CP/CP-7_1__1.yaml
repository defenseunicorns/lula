control-acronym: CP-7(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization identifies an alternate processing site that is separated
  from the primary processing site to reduce susceptibility to the same threats.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Threats that affect alternate processing sites are typically defined in
  organizational assessments of risk and include, for example, natural
  disasters, structural failures, hostile cyber attacks, and errors of
  omission/commission. Organizations determine what is considered a sufficient
  degree of separation between primary and alternate processing sites based on
  the types of threats that are of concern. For one particular type of threat
  (i.e., hostile cyber attack), the degree of separation between sites is less
  relevant. Related control: RA-3.


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: CP-7 (1) Guidance:
  The service provider may determine what is considered a sufficient degree of
  separation between the primary and alternate processing sites, based on the
  types of threats that are of concern. For one particular type of threat (i.e.,
  hostile cyber attack), the degree of separation between sites will be less
  relevant.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  alternate processing sites; contingency plan; alternate processing site;
  alternate processing site agreements; primary processing site agreements;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency plan
  alternate processing site responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information system recovery responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP
  Moderate Baseline, Rev 4

  Customers can leverage multi-availability zone infrastructure and cross-region
  replication to address alternate storage site controls if required by their
  organization. Customers choosing to use AWS for primary and alternate
  processing sites should determine if the sites meet their organization's
  geographical separation requirements.


  This control may be inheritable if customers choose an AWS region as an
  alternate storage site. However, if part of any system that is being created
  has components outside of AWS where this control applies, it is not
  inheritable....

cci-definition: '000516: The organization identifies an alternate processing
  site that is separated from the primary processing site to reduce
  susceptibility to the same threats.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed identifies and documents within the
  contingency plan an alternate processing site not susceptible to the same
  threats that exist at the primary processing site. The organization must
  document threats in the risk management strategy IAW PM-9, CCI 000227.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Risk management strategy

  2.) Contingency plan that identifies an alternate processing site that is
  separated from the processing site
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the risk management strategy and the contingency plan to
  ensure the organization identifies an alternate processing site that is
  separated from the primary processing site so as not to be susceptible to the
  same threats identified at the primary site.
