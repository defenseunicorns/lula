control-acronym: CP-8
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization establishes alternate telecommunications services including
  necessary agreements to permit the resumption of [Assignment:
  organization-defined information system operations] for essential missions and
  business functions within [Assignment: organization- defined time period] when
  the primary telecommunications capabilities are unavailable at either the
  primary or alternate processing or storage sites.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies to telecommunications services (data and voice) for
  primary and alternate processing and storage sites. Alternate
  telecommunications services reflect the continuity requirements in contingency
  plans to maintain essential missions/business functions despite the loss of
  primary telecommunications services. Organizations may specify different time
  periods for primary/alternate sites. Alternate telecommunications services
  include, for example, additional organizational or commercial ground-based
  circuits/lines or satellites in lieu of ground-based communications.
  Organizations consider factors such as availability, quality of service, and
  access when entering into alternate telecommunications agreements. Related
  controls: CP-2, CP-6, CP-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  alternate telecommunications services; contingency plan; primary and alternate
  telecommunications service agreements; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency plan
  telecommunications responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  system recovery responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibility for
  acquisitions/contractual agreements].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting telecommunications].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and gains approval for
  alternate telecommunications service agreements that permit the resumption of
  telecommunications services for essential missions IAW DoDI 8100.04. DoD has
  defined the time period as 1 hour (Availability High ) 12 hours (Availability
  Moderate) as defined in the contingency plan.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Continuity of Operations Plan
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the approved alternate telecommunications service
  agreements to ensure they permit the resumption of telecommunications services
  for essential mission IAW DoDI 8100.04. DoD has defined the time period as 1
  hour (Availability High ) 12 hours (Availability Moderate) as defined in the
  contingency plan.
