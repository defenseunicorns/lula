control-acronym: CP-6
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization

  a. Establishes an alternate storage site including necessary agreements to
  permit the storage and retrieval of information system backup information; and

  b. Ensures that the alternate storage site provides information security
  safeguards equivalent to that of the primary site.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Alternate storage sites are sites that are geographically distinct from
  primary storage sites. An alternate storage site maintains duplicate copies of
  information and data in the event that the primary storage site is not
  available. Items covered by alternate storage site agreements include, for
  example, environmental conditions at alternate sites, access rules, physical
  and environmental protection requirements, and coordination of
  delivery/retrieval of backup media. Alternate storage sites reflect the
  requirements in contingency plans so that organizations can maintain essential
  missions/business functions despite disruption, compromise, or failure in
  organizational information systems. Related controls: CP-2, CP-7, CP-9, CP-10,
  MP-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  alternate storage sites; contingency plan; alternate storage site agreements;
  primary storage site agreements; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency plan
  alternate storage site responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information system recovery responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for storing and retrieving
  information system backup information at the alternate storage site; automated
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing storage and retrieval of information
  system backup information at the alternate storage site].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP
  Moderate Baseline, Rev 4

control-implementation-narrative: >-
  Customers can leverage multi-availability zone infrastructure and cross-region
  replication for services that support it to address alternate storage site
  controls if required by their organization.


  This control may be inheritable if customers choose an AWS region as an
  alternate storage site. However, if part of any system that is being created
  has components outside of AWS where this control applies, it is not
  inheritable....

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed establishes an alternate storage
  site and documents relevant information within the contingency plan.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Contingency plan

  2.) Alternate storage site MOU/MOA
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the contingency plan to confirm the organization has
  established an alternate storage site.
