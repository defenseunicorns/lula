  Description:

  The organization provides for the recovery and reconstitution of the
  information system to a known state after a disruption, compromise, or
  failure.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Recovery is executing information system contingency plan activities to
  restore organizational missions/business functions. Reconstitution takes place
  following recovery and includes activities for returning organizational
  information systems to fully operational states. Recovery and reconstitution
  operations reflect mission and business priorities, recovery point/time and
  reconstitution objectives, and established organizational metrics consistent
  with contingency plan requirements. Reconstitution includes the deactivation
  of any interim information system capabilities that may have been needed
  during recovery operations. Reconstitution also includes assessments of fully
  restored information system capabilities, reestablishment of continuous
  monitoring activities, potential information system reauthorizations, and
  activities to prepare the systems against future disruptions, compromises, or
  failures. Recovery/reconstitution capabilities employed by organizations can
  include both automated mechanisms and manual procedures. Related controls:

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  information system backup; contingency plan; information system backup test
  results; contingency plan test results; contingency plan test documentation;
  redundant secondary system for information system backups; location(s) of
  redundant secondary backup system(s); other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency planning,
  recovery, and/or reconstitution responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes implementing information system
  recovery and reconstitution operations; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing information system recovery and reconstitution operations].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed provides automated mechanisms or
  manual procedures, or a combination of the two, for the recovery and
  reconstitution of its information system to a known state after a compromise.
  The organization must identify the selected method in the contingency plan.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated contingency plan, referencing section which identifies
  automated mechanisms or manual procedures for the recovery and reconstitution
  of its information system to a known state after a compromise
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the contingency plan to ensure it identifies the recovery
  and reconstitution method for its information system to a known state after a
  compromise.

test-results: 'In UDS, recovery and reconstitution after a disruption,
  compromise, or failure are achieved through a coordinated, automated process
  that restores the system to a known secure state. This is primarily managed
  using Infrastructure as Code with OpenTofu and Zarf, which ensure that the
  systemâs baseline configuration and deployments are version-controlled and
  can be redeployed consistently. Velero plays a key role by regularly backing
  up Kubernetes resources and persistent data, allowing the system to be
  restored to a recent, known state in the event of data loss or corruption.
  Complementing these measures, monitoring and logging tools such as Prometheus,
  Grafana, and Loki provide real-time visibility to verify that the system state
  aligns with expected security baselines post-recovery. Together, these
  components enable UDS to rapidly recover and reconstitute the information
  system to a secure, operational state following disruptions.'
