control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization implements incident handling capability for insider threats.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  While many organizations address insider threat incidents as an inherent part
  of their organizational incident response capability, this control enhancement
  provides additional emphasis on this type of threat and the need for specific
  incident handling capabilities (as defined within organizations) to provide
  appropriate and timely responses.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident handling; automated mechanisms supporting incident handling;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; incident response plan; security plan;
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident handling
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Incident handling capability for the organization].

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Incident Response Plan, referencing incident handling
  capability for insider threats section

  2.) Incident after action reports
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the incident response plan as well as a sampling of
  incident after action reports to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed implements incident handling capability for insider
  threats.
