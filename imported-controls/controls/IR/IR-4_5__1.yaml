  Description:

  The organization implements a configurable capability to automatically disable
  the information system if [Assignment: organization-defined security
  violations] are detected.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident handling; automated mechanisms supporting incident handling;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; incident response plan; security plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident handling
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Incident handling capability for the organization;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing automatic disabling of the
  information system].

cci: 830
cci-definition: '000830: The organization defines security violations that, if
  detected, initiate a configurable capability to automatically disable the
  information system.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and document a list of
  security violations that upon occurrence initiate an automated action to
  disable or shutdown the information system. Violations may be identified by
  specific activity or by class/type of activity. DoD has determined the
  security violations are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) List of documented security violations
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the list of documented security violations to ensure the
  organization has clearly identified those violations that initiate an
  automated disabling or shut down of the information system. DoD has determined
  the security violations are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
