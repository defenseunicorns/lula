control-acronym: IR-6
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Requires personnel to report suspected security incidents to the
  organizational incident response capability within [Assignment:
  organization-defined time period]; and

  b. Reports security incident information to [Assignment: organization-defined
  authorities].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The intent of this control is to address both specific incident reporting
  requirements within an organization and the formal incident reporting
  requirements for federal agencies and their subordinate organizations.
  Suspected security incidents include, for example, the receipt of suspicious
  email communications that can potentially contain malicious code. The types of
  security incidents reported, the content and timeliness of the reports, and
  the designated reporting authorities reflect applicable federal laws,
  Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance.
  Current federal policy requires that all federal agencies (unless specifically
  exempted from such requirements) report security incidents to the United
  States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) within specified time
  frames designated in the US-CERT Concept of Operations for Federal Cyber
  Security Incident Handling. Related controls: IR-4, IR-5, IR-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident reporting; incident reporting records and documentation; incident
  response plan; security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident reporting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; personnel who have/should have reported incidents; personnel
  (authorities) to whom incident information is to be reported].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for incident reporting; automated
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing incident reporting].

  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to report to the appropriate CIRT/CERT (such as US-CERT, DoD CERT, IC CERT).
  Any security incidents IAW the incident response plan (IR-8). Reporting shall
  be conducted IAW CJCSM 6510.01B.
