control-acronym: IR-4
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization

  a. Implements an incident handling capability for security incidents that
  includes preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and
  recovery;

  b. Coordinates incident handling activities with contingency planning
  activities; and

  c. Incorporates lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into
  incident response procedures, training, and testing/exercises, and implements
  the resulting changes accordingly.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations recognize that incident response capability is dependent on the
  capabilities of organizational information systems and the mission/business
  processes being supported by those systems. Therefore, organizations consider
  incident response as part of the definition, design, and development of
  mission/business processes and information systems. Incident-related
  information can be obtained from a variety of sources including, for example,
  audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring,
  user/administrator reports, and reported supply chain events. Effective
  incident handling capability includes coordination among many organizational
  entities including, for example, mission/business owners, information system
  owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices, physical and personnel
  security offices, legal departments, operations personnel, procurement
  offices, and the risk executive (function). Related controls: AU-6, CM-6,
  CP-2, CP-4, IR-2, IR-3, IR-8, PE-6, SC-5, SC-7, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; contingency planning policy;
  procedures addressing incident handling; incident response plan; contingency
  plan; security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident handling
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with contingency planning
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Incident handling capability for the organization].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] Privacy (Confidentiality Impact Level: Moderate) Overlay: A
  strategic, well-thought-out security incident response program will integrate
  with privacy incident and breach response where appropriate, with the two
  processes being mutually supportive.

  handling activity changes to incident response procedures, training and
  testing/exercise accordingly.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will follow the latest incident
  response plan (IR-8) that has been revised (based on IR-4, CCI-000824) and
  disseminated. Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Incident Response Plan

  2.) After action reports
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines recent changes to the incident response plan (based on
  IR-4, CCI 000824) to verify that they have been disseminated and reviews the
  most recent after action report to ensure that changes have been followed.
