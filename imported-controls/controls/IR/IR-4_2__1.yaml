control-acronym: IR-4(2)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization includes dynamic reconfiguration of [Assignment:
  organization-defined information system components] as part of the incident
  response capability.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Dynamic reconfiguration includes, for example, changes to router rules, access
  control lists, intrusion detection/prevention system parameters, and filter
  rules for firewalls and gateways. Organizations perform dynamic
  reconfiguration of information systems, for example, to stop attacks, to
  misdirect attackers, and to isolate components of systems, thus limiting the
  extent of the damage from breaches or compromises. Organizations include time
  frames for achieving the reconfiguration of information systems in the
  definition of the reconfiguration capability, considering the potential need
  for rapid response in order to effectively address sophisticated cyber
  threats. Related controls: AC-2, AC-4, AC-16, CM-2, CM-3, CM-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident handling; automated mechanisms supporting incident handling; list of
  system components to be dynamically reconfigured as part of incident response
  capability; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; information system audit
  records; incident response plan; security plan; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident handling
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms that support and/or implement dynamic
  reconfiguration of components as part of incident response].

  The organization being inspected/assessed will ensure that their incident
  response plan includes procedures for dynamic reconfiguration of information
  system components defined in IR-4 (2), CCI 2781 as part of the incident
  response capability IAW CM-3.

  Dynamic reconfiguration bypasses the organization's standard CCB process and
  may include, for example, changes to router rules, access control lists,
  intrusion detection/prevention systems, firewalls, etc. Organizations will
  have procedures to examine dynamic reconfiguration changes at the earliest
  opportunity IAW CCB.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Incident Response Plan, referencing dynamic
  reconfiguration section
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the incident response plan and verifies it has procedures
  addressing dynamic reconfiguration of information system components defined in
  IR-4 (2), CCI 2781 as part of the incident response capability IAW CM-3.
