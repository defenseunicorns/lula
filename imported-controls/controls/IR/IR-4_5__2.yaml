  Description:

  The organization implements a configurable capability to automatically disable
  the information system if [Assignment: organization-defined security
  violations] are detected.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident handling; automated mechanisms supporting incident handling;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; incident response plan; security plan;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident handling
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Incident handling capability for the organization;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing automatic disabling of the
  information system].

  security violations are detected.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will clearly identify, document, and
  implement a configurable automated mechanism (or mechanisms) that utilizes the
  list of security violations identified in IR-4 (5), CCI 000830 to disable or
  shutdown the information system. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 831. Recommended
  Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation that identifies and implements a configurable automated
  mechanism (or mechanisms) that utilizes the list of security violations
  identified in IR-4 (5), CCI 000830 to disable or shutdown the information
  system.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure an automated mechanism is configured
  to disable or shutdown the information system based on the identified security
  violations (IR-4 (5), CCI 000830). For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 831.

test-results: 'UDS provides configurable, automated mechanisms to respond to
  detected security violations, though it typically stops short of automatically
  disabling the entire system, which may impact mission availability.
  Specifically, NeuVector can actively monitors containerized workloads for
  security violations or anomalous behavior, automatically quarantining or
  blocking compromised or suspicious containers to limit impact. Additionally,
  policy enforcement via Pepr ensures unauthorized or misconfigured resources
  are denied deployment. While UDS inherently supports automatic and immediate
  security responses such as isolating compromised containers or network
  segments configuring the platform to completely disable system-wide services
  upon detection of certain security violations is an organizational decision,
  dependent on defined security policies, risk tolerances, and operational
  requirements. Such broad action would require explicit policy definition and
  additional procedural integration beyond UDSâs built-in technical
  capabilities.'
