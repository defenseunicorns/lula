control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization correlates incident information and individual incident
  responses to achieve an organization-wide perspective on incident awareness
  and response.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Sometimes the nature of a threat event, for example, a hostile cyber attack,
  is such that it can only be observed by bringing together information from
  different sources including various reports and reporting procedures
  established by organizations.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident handling; incident response plan; security plan; automated mechanisms
  supporting incident and event correlation; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; incident management correlation logs; event management
  correlation logs; security information and event management logs; incident
  management correlation reports; event management correlation reports; security
  information and event management reports; audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident handling
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with whom incident information and
  individual incident responses are to be correlated].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for correlating incident
  information and individual incident responses; automated mechanisms that
  support and or implement correlation of incident response information with
  individual incident responses].

cci-definition: '000829: The organization correlates incident information and
  individual incident responses to achieve an organization-wide perspective on
  incident awareness and response.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines procedures to examine
  incident information gathered and the actual actions taken by both the
  individuals affected and the incident response personnel. These procedures
  shall be defined IAW CJCSM 6510.01B. The end goal is to achieve a top level
  perspective of the effectiveness of the incident response and awareness.
  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Incident response plan

  2.) Minutes from an incident response after action meeting or similar activity
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines proof of the analysis (such as minutes from an incident
  response after action meeting or other similar activity) to ensure that
  incident information is being examined and correlated.
