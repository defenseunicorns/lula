control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization coordinates incident handling capability for insider threats
  across [Assignment: organization-defined components or elements of the
  organization].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Incident handling for insider threat incidents (including preparation,
  detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery) requires close
  coordination among a variety of organizational components or elements to be
  effective. These components or elements include, for example, mission/business
  owners, information system owners, human resources offices, procurement
  offices, personnel/physical security offices, operations personnel, and risk
  executive (function). In addition, organizations may require external support
  from federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident handling; incident response plan; security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident handling
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; organizational personnel/elements with whom incident
  handling capability is to be coordinated].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for coordinating incident
  handling].

cci-definition: '002784: The organization defines components or elements of the
  organization in which incident handling capability for insider threats will be
  coordinated.'
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents components or
  elements of the organization in which incident handling capability for insider
  threats will be coordinated. DoD has determined the components or elements are
  not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation that defines components or elements of the organization in
  which incident handling capability for insider threats will be coordinated.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented components or elements to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed defines components or elements of the
  organization in which incident handling capability for insider threats will be
  coordinated. DoD has determined the components or elements are not appropriate
  to define at the Enterprise level.
