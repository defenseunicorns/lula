  Description:

  The organization employs automated mechanisms to support the incident handling
  process.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Automated mechanisms supporting incident handling processes include, for
  example, online incident management systems.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident handling; automated mechanisms supporting incident handling;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; information system audit records;
  incident response plan; security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident handling
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms that support and/or implement the
  incident handling process].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will document within their incident
  handling plan, procedures to leverage the Joint Incident Management System
  (JIMS). For the DoD, JIMS is the automated mechanism.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Incident Response Plan, referencing automated mechanisms
  section
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the incident handling plan to ensure that there are
  procedures identified to leverage the JIMS.
