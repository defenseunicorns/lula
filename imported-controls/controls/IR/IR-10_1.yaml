  Description:

  The organization establishes an integrated team of forensic/malicious code
  analysts, tool developers, and real-time operations personnel.

  Supplemental Guidance:

  Having an integrated team for incident response facilitates information
  sharing. Such capability allows organizational personnel, including
  developers, implementers, and operators, to leverage the team knowledge of the
  threat in order to implement defensive measures that will enable organizations
  to deter intrusions more effectively. Moreover, it promotes the rapid
  detection of intrusions, development of appropriate mitigations, and the
  deployment of effective defensive measures. For example, when an intrusion is
  detected, the integrated security analysis team can rapidly develop an
  appropriate response for operators to implement, correlate the new incident
  with information on past intrusions, and augment ongoing intelligence
  development. This enables the team to identify adversary TTPs that are linked
  to the operations tempo or to specific missions/business functions, and to
  define responsive actions in a way that does not disrupt the mission/business
  operations. Ideally, information security analysis teams are distributed
  within organizations to make the capability more resilient.

  Added by [r4] Privacy (Confidentiality Impact Level: Moderate) Overlay: The
  integrated information security analysis team will support the organization's
  PII incident response team (as specified in OMB M-07-16) in all aspects of
  response to a security incident involving PII. Related Control: SE-2.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident response planning and security analysis team integration; incident
  response plan; other relevant documents or records].

  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident response and
  information security analysis responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; organizational personnel participating
  on integrated security analysis teams].

  Justification to Select: Added by [r4] Privacy (Confidentiality Impact Level:
  Moderate) Overlay: Instances of loss, theft, or compromise of PII may involve
  an information security related malicious code attack or intrusion. In such
  cases, the Integrated Information Security Analysis Team is the organization's
  subject matter experts best able to support the organization's PII incident
  response team required by OMB M-07-16. In addition to security implementers,
  developers, and operators; this internal team should also comprise of the
  Chief Information Officer, Chief Privacy Officer or Senior Official for
  Privacy among others.

  Regulatory Statutory Reference: Added by [r4] Privacy (Confidentiality Impact
  Level: Moderate) Overlay: OMB M-07-16, Att. 3, B.

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed establishes an integrated team of
  forensic/malicious code analysts, tool developers, and real-time operations
  personnel. The organization appoints team members and defines and documents
  roles and responsibilities for each member.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation that appoints team members for an integrated team of
  forensic/malicious code analysts, tool developers, and real-time operations
  personnel.

  2.) Documentation that defines roles and responsibilities for each member.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines appointments to the integrated team as well as the
  documented roles and responsibilities to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed establishes an integrated team of forensic/malicious code
  analysts, tool developers, and real-time operations personnel.
