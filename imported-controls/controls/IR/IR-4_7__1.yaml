  Description:

  The organization coordinates incident handling capability for insider threats
  across [Assignment: organization-defined components or elements of the
  organization].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Incident handling for insider threat incidents (including preparation,
  detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery) requires close
  coordination among a variety of organizational components or elements to be
  effective. These components or elements include, for example, mission/business
  owners, information system owners, human resources offices, procurement
  offices, personnel/physical security offices, operations personnel, and risk
  executive (function). In addition, organizations may require external support
  from federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident handling; incident response plan; security plan; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident handling
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; organizational personnel/elements with whom incident
  handling capability is to be coordinated].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for coordinating incident
  handling].
