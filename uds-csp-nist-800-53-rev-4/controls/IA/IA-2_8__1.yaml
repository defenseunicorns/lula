  Description:

  The information system implements replay-resistant authentication mechanisms
  for network access to privileged accounts.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to achieve
  successful authentications by replaying previous authentication messages.
  Replay-resistant techniques include, for example, protocols that use nonces or
  challenges such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and time synchronous or
  challenge-response one-time authenticators.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing user identification and authentication; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; list of privileged
  information system accounts; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  operations responsibilities; organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  identification and authentication capability; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing replay resistant authentication mechanisms].

  authentication mechanisms for network access to privileged accounts."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  implement replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for network access to
  privileged accounts. For information system components that have applicable
  STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the
  STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 1941.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Access Control Policy

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to implement
  replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for network access to privileged
  accounts. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the
  components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 1941.

test-results: UDS implements replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for
  network access to privileged accounts through its centralized identity
  management solution, Keycloak. Authentication to privileged accounts leverages
  cryptographically signed JSON Web Tokens (JWT) that include unique,
  timestamped session information, making replay attacks infeasible.
  Additionally, authentication sessions are secured via Transport Layer Security
  (TLS) with mutual TLS (mTLS) provided by the Istio Service Mesh, ensuring
  strong encryption and session integrity. The combination of secure token
  issuance, validation processes, and encrypted communication effectively
  prevents replay attacks, fully meeting the intent of this control requirement.
