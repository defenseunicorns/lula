  Description:

  The information system, for PKI-based authentication

  (a) Validates certifications by constructing and verifying a certification
  path to an accepted trust anchor including checking certificate status
  information;

  (b) Enforces authorized access to the corresponding private key;

  (c) Maps the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group;
  and

  (d) Implements a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and
  validation in case of inability to access revocation information via the
  network.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Status information for certification paths includes, for example, certificate
  revocation lists or certificate status protocol responses. For PIV cards,
  validation of certifications involves the construction and verification of a
  certification path to the Common Policy Root trust anchor including
  certificate policy processing. Related control: IA-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing authenticator management; security plan; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; PKI certification validation records; PKI certification
  revocation lists; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with PKI-based,
  authenticator management responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system
  developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  PKI-based, authenticator management capability].

cci-definition: "000186: The information system, for PKI-based authentication
  enforces authorized access to the corresponding private key."
implementation-guidance: "Information systems must not have access to usersâ
  private keys. The cryptographic container in which the private keys are stored
  (e.g. smart card or software module) implements access controls and
  protections to ensure that only the authorized user can activate the private
  key. DoD users agree to protect their PKI credentials in accordance with the
  DD-2842 agreement that is executed for each credential. They are reminded of
  these responsibilities in annual IA training. The private key identifying the
  information system must be stored in a cryptographic container that is FIPS
  140-2 validated. Only authorized information system operators should have
  access to activation data (e.g. password or PIN) for the private key.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP, referencing section on private key access

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks"
assessment-procedures: "The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the information system does not
  contain any usersâ private keys. The organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment examines the information system to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed has configured the information system to
  store its own private key in a FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic module."

test-results: UDS complies fully with DoD requirements for private key storage
  and access protections through its integrated PKI-based authentication
  mechanisms provided by Keycloak. Users authenticate using DoD-approved
  hardware tokens, such as Common Access Cards (CAC) or Personal Identity
  Verification (PIV) cards, wherein private keys are securely stored in
  cryptographic containers that enforce strict hardware-based access controls.
  These smart cards ensure that private keys never leave the secure hardware
  boundary and cannot be exported or accessed directly by UDS or Keycloak
  systems. Access to these keys is strictly limited to the authorized user, who
  must provide activation data (e.g., PIN) directly into their hardware token.
