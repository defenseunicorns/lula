  addressing authenticator management; registration process for receiving
  information system authenticators; list of authenticators requiring in-person
  registration; list of authenticators requiring trusted third party
  registration; authenticator registration documentation; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with authenticator
  management responsibilities; registration authority; organizational personnel

  The DoD PKI Certificate Policy (CP) defines DoD PKI subscribers (entities
  identified as the subject of PKI certificates) and the authentication
  requirements for issuance of credentials to subscribers. The NSS PKI CP
  defines NSS PKI subscribers and the authentication requirements for issuance
  of credentials to subscribers.

  DoD Components are automatically compliant with this CCI because they are
  covered by the DoD PKI CP and NSS PKI CP.
