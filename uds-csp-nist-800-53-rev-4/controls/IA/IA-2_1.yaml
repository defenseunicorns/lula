  Description:

  The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates organizational
  users (or processes acting on behalf of organizational users).


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizational users include employees or individuals that organizations deem
  to have equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors, guest researchers).
  This control applies to all accesses other than: 

  (i) accesses that are explicitly identified and documented in AC-14; and

  (ii) accesses that occur through authorized use of group authenticators
  without individual authentication. Organizations may require unique
  identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege
  accounts) or for detailed accountability of individual activity. Organizations
  employ passwords, tokens, or biometrics to authenticate user identities, or in
  the case multifactor authentication, or some combination thereof. Access to
  organizational information systems is defined as either local access or
  network access. Local access is any access to organizational information
  systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is
  obtained by direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is
  access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on
  behalf of users) where such access is obtained through network connections
  (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that
  involves communication through external networks (e.g., the Internet).
  Internal networks include local area networks and wide area networks. In
  addition, the use of encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) for network
  connections between organization-controlled endpoints and non-organization
  controlled endpoints may be treated as internal networks from the perspective
  of protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information traversing the
  network.


  Organizations can satisfy the identification and authentication requirements
  in this control by complying with the requirements in Homeland Security
  Presidential Directive 12 consistent with the specific organizational
  implementation plans. Multifactor authentication requires the use of two or
  more different factors to achieve authentication. The factors are defined as:
  (i) something you know (e.g., password, personal identification number [PIN]);
  (ii) something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or
  (iii) something you are (e.g., biometric). Multifactor solutions that require
  devices separate from information systems gaining access include, for example,
  hardware tokens providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and
  smart cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card
  and the DoD common access card. In addition to identifying and authenticating
  users at the information system level (i.e., at logon), organizations also
  employ identification and authentication mechanisms at the application level,
  when necessary, to provide increased information security. Identification and
  authentication requirements for other than organizational users are described
  in IA-8. Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-14, AC-17, AC-18, IA-4, IA-5, IA-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing user identification and authentication; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; list of information system
  accounts; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  operations responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with account management responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for uniquely identifying and
  authenticating users; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  identification and authentication capability].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  uniquely identify and authenticate organizational users (or processes acting
  on behalf of organizational users). For information system components that
  have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 764.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Access Control Policy

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to uniquely identify and
  authenticate organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of
  organizational users). For information system components that have applicable
  STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates
  the components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 764.

test-results: "UDS provides robust user identification and authentication via
  Keycloak, which serves as the central Identity Provider. Every user must
  authenticate with unique credentials (username/password, or certificates,
  etc.), and Keycloak verifies their identity before granting access to JWT
  tokens. This means the system positively identifies each user. Keycloak
  supports a variety of authentication mechanisms (from passwords to two-factor
  to smart cards), ensuring users are strongly authenticated before access.
  Moreover, for internal components, Istio mutual TLS ensures that even services
  identify each other with certificates. So whether itâs a human user or a
  service account, the stack has mechanisms to require proper authentication. By
  using Keycloak across all applications (single sign-on), UDS ensures
  consistent enforcement of user auth for all entry points."
