control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined security
  safeguards] to manage the risk of compromise due to individuals having
  accounts on multiple information systems.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  When individuals have accounts on multiple information systems, there is the
  risk that the compromise of one account may lead to the compromise of other
  accounts if individuals use the same authenticators. Possible alternatives
  include, for example: (i) having different authenticators on all systems; (ii)
  employing some form of single sign-on mechanism; or (iii) including some form
  of one-time passwords on all systems.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing authenticator management; security plan; list of individuals having
  accounts on multiple information systems; list of security safeguards intended
  to manage risk of compromise due to individuals having accounts on multiple
  information systems; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with authenticator
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  safeguards for authenticator management].

  DoD has defined the security safeguards as policies and user training
  including advising users not to use the same password for any of the
  following: Domains of differing classification levels. More than one domain of
  a classification level (e.g., internal agency network and Intelink). More than
  one privilege level (e.g., user, administrator).

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically Compliant
assessment-procedures: "The organization being inspected/assessed is
  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the security safeguards as policies and user training
  including advising users not to use the same password for any of the
  following: Domains of differing classification levels. More than one domain of
  a classification level (e.g., internal agency network and Intelink). More than
  one privilege level (e.g., user, administrator)."
