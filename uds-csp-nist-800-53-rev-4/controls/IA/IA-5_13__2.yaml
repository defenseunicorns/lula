  Description:

  The information system prohibits the use of cached authenticators after
  [Assignment: organization-defined time period].


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing authenticator management; security plan; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with authenticator
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  authenticator management capability].

  authenticators after an organization defined time period."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  prohibit the use of cached authenticators after an organization defined time
  period. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs,
  the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG
  guidance that pertains to CCI 2007.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP documenting the configuration of the information
  system to prohibit the use of cached authenticators after an organization
  defined time period.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to prohibit the use of
  cached authenticators after an organization defined time period. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 2007.

test-results: In UDS, cached authenticators (such as session tokens) are
  automatically invalidated after the organization-defined time period. For
  example, Keycloak issues JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) with a set expiration time
  that strictly limits their validity. Once that period elapses, even if the
  token is cached locally, the system rejects its use and requires
  re-authentication or a token refresh. Additionally, service-to-service
  communications managed by Istio enforce similar expiration policies on cached
  authentication credentials used in mutual TLS sessions.
