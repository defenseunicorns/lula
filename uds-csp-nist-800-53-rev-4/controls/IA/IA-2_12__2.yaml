  Description:

  The information system accepts and electronically verifies Personal Identity
  Verification (PIV) credentials.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement applies to organizations implementing logical access
  control systems (LACS) and physical access control systems (PACS). Personal
  Identity Verification (PIV) credentials are those credentials issued by
  federal agencies that conform to FIPS Publication 201 and supporting guidance
  documents. OMB Memorandum 11-11 requires federal agencies to continue
  implementing the requirements specified in HSPD-12 to enable agency-wide use
  of PIV credentials. Related controls: AU-2, PE-3, SA-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing user identification and authentication; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; PIV verification records;
  evidence of PIV credentials; PIV credential authorizations; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  operations responsibilities; organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  acceptance and verification of PIV credentials].

  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  verify PIV/CAC authentication. This control enhancement applies to
  organizations implementing logical access control systems (LACS) and physical
  access control systems (PACS). For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 1954.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Access Control Policy

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to verify PIV/CAC
  authentication. For information system components that have applicable STIGs
  or SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the
  components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 1954.

test-results: "In UDS, Personal Identity Verification (PIV)-compliant
  credentials are electronically verified using a combination of
  certificate-based authentication mechanisms within Keycloak and mutual TLS
  within the Istio service mesh. When a user presents their CAC/PIV card at
  login, Keycloak reads and validates the embedded x.509 certificateâchecking
  its signature against trusted DoD Certificate Authorities, ensuring the
  certificate is within its validity period, and verifying its revocation
  status."
