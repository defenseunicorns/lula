  Description:

  The information system implements multifactor authentication for local access
  to non-privileged accounts.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing user identification and authentication; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; list of information system
  accounts; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  operations responsibilities; organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  multifactor authentication capability].

cci: 768
cci-definition: "000768: The information system implements multifactor
  authentication for local access to non-privileged accounts."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  implement multifactor authentication for local access to non-privileged
  accounts. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG
  guidance that pertains to CCI 768.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Access Control Policy

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to implement multifactor
  authentication for local access to non-privileged accounts. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization
  conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that
  the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the information
  system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 768.

test-results: "Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Similarly to IA-2(3),
  this is multi-factor for local access for non-privileged users. UDS doesnât
  have local interactive access for non-privileged users at all (no one is
  logging directly into a container or host with a user account; they go through
  network services)."
