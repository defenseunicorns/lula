  Description:

  The information system, for password-based authentication:

  (a) Enforces minimum password complexity of [Assignment: organization-defined
  requirements for case sensitivity, number of characters, mix of upper-case
  letters, lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters, including
  minimum requirements for each type];

  (b) Enforces at least the following number of changed characters when new
  passwords are created: [Assignment: organization-defined number];

  (c) Stores and transmits only cryptographically-protected passwords;

  (d) Enforces password minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions of
  [Assignment: organization-defined numbers for lifetime minimum, lifetime
  maximum];

  (e) Prohibits password reuse for [Assignment: organization-defined number]
  generations; and

  (f) Allows the use of a temporary password for system logons with an immediate
  change to a permanent password.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement applies to single-factor authentication of
  individuals using passwords as individual or group authenticators, and in a
  similar manner, when passwords are part of multifactor authenticators. This
  control enhancement does not apply when passwords are used to unlock hardware
  authenticators (e.g., Personal Identity Verification cards). The
  implementation of such password mechanisms may not meet all of the
  requirements in the enhancement. Cryptographically-protected passwords
  include, for example, encrypted versions of passwords and one-way
  cryptographic hashes of passwords. The number of changed characters refers to
  the number of changes required with respect to the total number of positions
  in the current password. Password lifetime restrictions do not apply to
  temporary passwords. To mitigate certain brute force attacks against
  passwords, organizations may also consider salting passwords. Related control:
  IA-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; password
  policy; procedures addressing authenticator management; security plan;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; password configurations and associated
  documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with authenticator
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  password-based authenticator management capability].

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically Compliant
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed is automatically compliant with this
  CCI because they are covered at the DoD level.

  DoD has defined the minimum number of characters as 50% of the minimum
