  Description:

  The information system implements multifactor authentication for local access
  to privileged accounts.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related control: AC-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing user identification and authentication; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; list of information system
  accounts; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  operations responsibilities; organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  multifactor authentication capability].

cci: 767
cci-definition: "000767: The information system implements multifactor
  authentication for local access to privileged accounts."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  implement multifactor authentication for local access to privileged accounts.
  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 767.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Access Control Policy

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to implement multifactor
  authentication for local access to privileged accounts. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 767.

test-results: "Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (This enhancement
  involves multi-factor for local access (like console access to a server). In
  the context of UDS, there is no âlocalâ login to an application all access
  to UDS services is over the network. The underlying host machines (nodes of
  the Kubernetes cluster) are not considered part of the UDS application stack
  from a user perspective; those are managed by sysadmins with their own OS
  login controls (likely using SSH keys, etc., which indeed can be multi-factor
  if using PIV cards). But thatâs outside of UDS. UDS itself doesnât have an
  interactive local console for users.)"
