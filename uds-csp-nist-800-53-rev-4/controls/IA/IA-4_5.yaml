control-acronym: IA-4
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization manages information system identifiers by:

  a. Receiving authorization from [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
  roles] to assign an individual, group, role, or device identifier; 

  b. Selecting an identifier that identifies an individual, group, role, or
  device; 

  c. Assigning the identifier to the intended individual, group, role, or
  device; 

  d. Preventing reuse of identifiers for [Assignment: organization-defined time
  period]; and 

  e. Disabling the identifier after [Assignment: organization-defined time
  period of inactivity].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Common device identifiers include, for example, media access control (MAC),
  Internet protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers.
  Management of individual identifiers is not applicable to shared information
  system accounts (e.g., guest and anonymous accounts). Typically, individual
  identifiers are the user names of the information system accounts assigned to
  those individuals. In such instances, the account management activities of
  AC-2 use account names provided by IA-4. This control also addresses
  individual identifiers not necessarily associated with information system
  accounts (e.g., identifiers used in physical security control databases
  accessed by badge reader systems for access to information systems).
  Preventing reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of
  previously used individual, group, role, or device identifiers to different
  individuals, groups, roles, or devices. Related controls: AC-2, IA-2, IA-3,
  IA-5, IA-8, SC-37.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing identifier management; procedures addressing account management;
  security plan; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; list of information
  system accounts; list of identifiers generated from physical access control
  devices; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with identifier management
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  identifier management].

  DoD has defined the time period as 1 year for user identifiers (DoD is not
  going to specify value for device identifier).


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically Compliant
assessment-procedures: The organization being inspected/assessed is
  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the time period as 1 year for user identifiers (DoD is
  not going to specify value for device identifier).
