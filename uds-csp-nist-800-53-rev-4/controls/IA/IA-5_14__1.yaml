  Description:

  The organization, for PKI-based authentication, employs a deliberate
  organization-wide methodology for managing the content of PKI trust stores
  installed across all platforms including networks, operating systems,
  browsers, and applications.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing authenticator management; security plan; organizational methodology
  for managing content of PKI trust stores across installed all platforms;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; enterprise security architecture
  documentation; enterprise architecture documentation; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with authenticator
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  PKI-based authenticator management capability; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing the PKI trust store capability].

implementation-guidance: "DoD trust store management requirements are defined in
  information system componentsâ applicable STIGs and SRGs. All information
  systems are required to undergo a STIG compliance review as part of their
  certification and accreditation process prior to being granted an authority to
  operate.

  DoD Components are automatically compliant with this CCI because they are
  covered by the DoD-level STIGs and SRGs.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically Compliant"
