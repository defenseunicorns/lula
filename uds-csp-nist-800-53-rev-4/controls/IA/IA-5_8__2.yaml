  Description:

  The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined security
  safeguards] to manage the risk of compromise due to individuals having
  accounts on multiple information systems.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  When individuals have accounts on multiple information systems, there is the
  risk that the compromise of one account may lead to the compromise of other
  accounts if individuals use the same authenticators. Possible alternatives
  include, for example: (i) having different authenticators on all systems; (ii)
  employing some form of single sign-on mechanism; or (iii) including some form
  of one-time passwords on all systems.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing authenticator management; security plan; list of individuals having
  accounts on multiple information systems; list of security safeguards intended
  to manage risk of compromise due to individuals having accounts on multiple
  information systems; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with authenticator
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  safeguards for authenticator management].

  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements policies
  and user training including advising users not to use the same password for
  any of the following: Domains of differing classification levels. More than
  one domain of a classification level (e.g., internal agency network and
  Intelink). More than one privilege level (e.g., user, administrator).

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP documenting user training requirements

  2.) Training records for all users

  3.) Training documentation used to train users
assessment-procedures: "The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented policies as well as training records to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed implements policies and
  training advising users not to use the same password for any of the following:
  Domains of differing classification levels. More than one domain of a
  classification level (e.g., internal agency network and Intelink). More than
  one privilege level (e.g., user, administrator)."

test-results: UDS supports organizational efforts to manage risks associated
  with account use across multiple systems through its centralized identity
  management solution, Keycloak. Keycloak provides robust single sign-on (SSO)
  and federated authentication capabilities, ensuring centralized and consistent
  enforcement of authentication policies across connected systems. By leveraging
  federated identity services, UDS significantly reduces the likelihood of
  credential reuse and unauthorized account access.
