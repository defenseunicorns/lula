  Description:

  The information system, for PKI-based authentication

  (a) Validates certifications by constructing and verifying a certification
  path to an accepted trust anchor including checking certificate status
  information;

  (b) Enforces authorized access to the corresponding private key;

  (c) Maps the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group;
  and

  (d) Implements a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and
  validation in case of inability to access revocation information via the
  network.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Status information for certification paths includes, for example, certificate
  revocation lists or certificate status protocol responses. For PIV cards,
  validation of certifications involves the construction and verification of a
  certification path to the Common Policy Root trust anchor including
  certificate policy processing. Related control: IA-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing authenticator management; security plan; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; PKI certification validation records; PKI certification
  revocation lists; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with PKI-based,
  authenticator management responsibilities; organizational personnel with

implementation-guidance: >-
  The information system performing hardware token-based authentication must be
  configured to validate DoD-approved PKI credentials in accordance with RFC
  5280. The information system must be configured to perform a revocation check
  as part of the certificate validation process. Revocation checking may be
  performed using certificate revocation lists (CRLs) published by the issuing
  PKI or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) services. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  185.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP documenting the use of a validated DoD-approved
  PKI credentials in accordance with RFC 5280

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed has configured the information system to validate
  DoD-approved PKI credentials in accordance with RFC 5280. The organization
  conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information system to ensure
  the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the information
  system to perform a revocation check as part of the certificate validation
  process. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs,
  the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components
  to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 185.

test-results: UDS employs robust Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)-based
  authentication validation through its centralized identity management
  solution, Keycloak. Keycloak is technically configured to authenticate users
  via hardware token-based credentials such as DoD-approved Common Access Card
  (CAC) and Personal Identity Verification (PIV) certificates. Keycloak
  validates these certificates in compliance with RFC 5280, including explicit
  construction and verification of certificate trust paths up to established,
  trusted DoD certificate authorities. Additionally, Keycloak performs real-time
  revocation checks through Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and/or Online
  Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) services, ensuring immediate detection of
  revoked or compromised certificates.
