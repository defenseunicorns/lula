control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization ensures that unencrypted static authenticators are not
  embedded in applications or access scripts or stored on function keys.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations exercise caution in determining whether embedded or stored
  authenticators are in encrypted or unencrypted form. If authenticators are
  used in the manner stored, then those representations are considered
  unencrypted authenticators. This is irrespective of whether that
  representation is perhaps an encrypted version of something else (e.g., a
  password).


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing authenticator management; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  logical access scripts; application code reviews for detecting unencrypted
  static authenticators; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with authenticator
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  authenticator management capability; automated mechanisms implementing
  authentication in applications].

  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements
  requirements that static authenticators are not embedded in applications.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP requiring that static authenticators are not
  embedded in applications.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the requirements that static authenticators are not
  embedded in applications to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  ensures unencrypted static authenticators are not embedded in applications.

test-results: "In UDS, unencrypted static authenticators are explicitly
  disallowed from being hard-coded into application binaries or source code.
  Instead, sensitive authentication credentials are centrally managed using
  Kubernetes Secrets, which can be configured to store secrets in base64-encoded
  form and optionally encrypt them at rest using an encryption provider in etcd.
  These credentials are dynamically injected into application pods at runtime
  through environment variables or mounted as secret volumes, ensuring that no
  plaintext values are included in the application image. Additionally, UDS
  integrates with secure vault solutions that provide API-driven access to
  secrets with fine-grained access controls and audit logging. Keycloakâs
  credential management further enforces secure storage and retrieval of
  authentication data by using token-based authentication flows and
  certificate-based validation, ensuring that credentials are never statically
  embedded."
