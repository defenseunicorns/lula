control-acronym: IA-2(5)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization requires individuals to be authenticated with an individual
  authenticator when a group authenticator is employed.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Requiring individuals to use individual authenticators as a second level of
  authentication helps organizations to mitigate the risk of using group
  authenticators.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Identification and authentication policy; procedures
  addressing user identification and authentication; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; list of information system
  accounts; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  operations responsibilities; organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  authentication capability for group accounts].

  employed."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed requires individuals or configures
  the information system to require individuals to be authenticated with an
  individual authenticator when a group authenticator is employed. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 770.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Access Control Policy

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines standard operating procedures or system documentation to
  ensure the organization being inspected/assessed requires individuals to be
  authenticated with an individual authenticator when a group authenticator is
  employed. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the
  components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 770.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS utilizes
  individual-based authentication mechanisms exclusively through Keycloak,
  enforcing unique and traceable authentication credentials for each user
  account. Group authenticators, shared accounts, or shared authentication
  credentials are not supported or utilized within the UDS environment.
  Therefore, this control, which specifically addresses the requirement for
  individual authentication when group authenticators are in use, is not
  applicable to the provided UDS technology stack.)
