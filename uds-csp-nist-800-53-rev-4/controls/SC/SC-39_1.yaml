  Description:

  The information system maintains a separate execution domain for each
  executing process.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information systems can maintain separate execution domains for each executing
  process by assigning each process a separate address space. Each information
  system process has a distinct address space so that communication between
  processes is performed in a manner controlled through the security functions,
  and one process cannot modify the executing code of another process.
  Maintaining separate execution domains for executing processes can be
  achieved, for example, by implementing separate address spaces. This
  capability is available in most commercial operating systems that employ
  multi-state processor technologies. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, AC-6, SA-4,
  SA-5, SA-8, SC-2, SC-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system design documentation; information
  system architecture; independent verification and validation documentation;
  testing and evaluation documentation, other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Information system developers/integrators;
  information system security architect].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  separate execution domains for each executing process].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  maintain a separate execution domain for each executing process. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 2530.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks pertaining to CCI 2530.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to maintain a separate
  execution domain for each executing process. For information system components
  that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 2530.

test-results: "UDS leverages containerization which inherently provides process
  isolation. Each container has its own isolated process space, and the Linux
  kernel prevents processes in different containers from interacting except
  through defined interfaces (like network calls which are mediated by the
  service mesh). The container runtime and Kubernetes ensure that one container
  cannot directly read/write the memory of another. Namespaces, cgroups, and
  seccomp profiles can be used to further isolate processes. So, one
  applicationâs processes cannot interfere with or spy on another. This is a
  fundamental security benefit of the UDSâs architecture."
