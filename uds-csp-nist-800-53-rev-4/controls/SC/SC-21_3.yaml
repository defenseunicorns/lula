control-acronym: SC-21
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system requests and performs data origin authentication and
  data integrity verification on the name/address resolution responses the
  system receives from authoritative sources.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Each client of name resolution services either performs this validation on its
  own, or has authenticated channels to trusted validation providers.
  Information systems that provide name and address resolution services for
  local clients include, for example, recursive resolving or caching domain name
  system (DNS) servers. DNS client resolvers either perform validation of DNSSEC
  signatures, or clients use authenticated channels to recursive resolvers that
  perform such validations. Information systems that use technologies other than
  the DNS to map between host/service names and network addresses provide other
  means to enable clients to verify the authenticity and integrity of response
  data. Related controls: SC-20, SC-22.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing secure name/address resolution service (recursive or caching
  resolver); information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; information system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with responsibilities for managing DNS].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing data
  origin authentication and data integrity verification for name/address
  resolution services].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the:

  1. recursive/caching name server software to enable DNSSEC;

  2. software to enable DNSSEC validation; and

  3. software to establish a secure entry point trust anchor by installing key
  signing keys in the software configuration of trusted keys. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that determines the
  name server software configuration files and pertains to CCI 2467.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) DNS logs.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks that determine the name server software
  configuration files and pertain to CCI 2467.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  utilizes DNSSEC diagnostic tools, such as dig, and performs queries which will
  exercise the data flow path for recursive name resolution services. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs that
  determine the name server software configuration files and pertain to CCI
  2467.
