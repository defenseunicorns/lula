control-acronym: SC-5(3)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Employs [Assignment: organization-defined monitoring tools] to detect
  indicators of denial of service attacks against the information system; and

  (b) Monitors [Assignment: organization-defined information system resources]
  to determine if sufficient resources exist to prevent effective denial of
  service attacks.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations consider utilization and capacity of information system
  resources when managing risk from denial of service due to malicious attacks.
  Denial of service attacks can originate from external or internal sources.
  Information system resources sensitive to denial of service include, for
  example, physical disk storage, memory, and CPU cycles. Common safeguards to
  prevent denial of service attacks related to storage utilization and capacity
  include, for example, instituting disk quotas, configuring information systems
  to automatically alert administrators when specific storage capacity
  thresholds are reached, using file compression technologies to maximize
  available storage space, and imposing separate partitions for system and user
  data. Related controls: CA-7, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing denial of service protection; information system design
  documentation; information system monitoring tools and techniques
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with detection and monitoring responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms/tools implementing information system
  monitoring for denial of service attacks].

cci-definition: "002388: Defines the monitoring tools to be employed to detect

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents a list of
  monitoring tools to be employed to detect indicators of denial of service
  attacks against the information system. DoD has determined the monitoring
  tools are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated list of monitoring tools to be employed to detect
  indicators of denial of service attacks against the information system.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented monitoring tools to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed defines a list of monitoring tools to be
  employed to detect indicators of denial of service attacks against the
  information system. DoD has determined the monitoring tools are not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
