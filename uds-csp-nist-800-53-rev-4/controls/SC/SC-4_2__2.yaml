control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system prevents unauthorized information transfer via shared
  resources in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined procedures]
  when system processing explicitly switches between different information
  classification levels or security categories.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement applies when there are explicit changes in
  information processing levels during information system operations, for
  example, during multilevel processing and periods processing with information
  at different classification levels or security categories.
  Organization-defined procedures may include, for example, approved
  sanitization processes for electronically stored information.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing information protection in shared system resources; information
  system design documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms preventing unauthorized transfer of
  information via shared system resources].

  information transfer via shared resources in accordance with
  organization-defined procedures when system processing explicitly switches

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  prevent unauthorized information transfer via shared resources in accordance
  with procedures defined in SC-4 (2), CCI 2383 when system processing
  explicitly switches between different information classification levels or
  security categories. For information system components that have applicable
  STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the
  STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 2384.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated procedure documentation to prevent the unauthorized
  information transfer via shared resources when system processing explicitly
  switches between different information classification levels or security
  categories.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to prevent unauthorized
  information transfer via shared resources in accordance with procedures
  defined in SC-4 (2), CCI 2383 when system processing explicitly switches
  between different information classification levels or security categories.
  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 2384.

test-results: "UDS prevents unauthorized information sharing through shared
  resources. Because each container has isolated memory and storage, one app
  cannot peek into anotherâs memory space. Even within a node, the kernel
  enforces separation between containers (namespaces ensure, for example, a
  process in one container cannot see processes or memory of another container).
  Kubernetes by default also segregates resources a volume mounted to one pod is
  not accessible to another unless explicitly shared. Temporary files or memory
  are local to each container. If sensitive data is in memory of Service A,
  Service B cannot access it unless Service A explicitly sends it (which would
  then be governed by access control and encryption). The use of mutual TLS
  (mTLS) means even network data on the wire isn't in clear text for others to
  potentially sniff. UDSâs containerization and encryption prevent data from
  one context leaking via shared system resources (like CPU caches, network,
  etc.) to another context."
