  Description:

  The information system maintains the [Selection (one or more):
  confidentiality; integrity] of information during preparation for transmission
  and during reception.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information can be either unintentionally or maliciously disclosed or modified
  during preparation for transmission or during reception including, for
  example, during aggregation, at protocol transformation points, and during
  packing/unpacking. These unauthorized disclosures or modifications compromise
  the confidentiality or integrity of the information. Related control: AU-10.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing transmission confidentiality and integrity; information system
  design documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  transmission confidentiality and/or integrity].

  and/or integrity of information during preparation for transmission."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  maintain the confidentiality and integrity of information during preparation
  for transmission. For information system components that have applicable STIGs
  or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the
  STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 2420. DoD has defined the selection as
  both confidentiality and integrity.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System Security Plan (SSP) which defines information
  system's MAC and confidentiality levels.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks pertaining to CCI 2420.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to maintain the
  confidentiality and integrity of information during preparation for
  transmission. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the
  components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 2420.

test-results: UDS system maintains confidentiality and integrity during
  preparation for transmission through a multi-layered security approach. Data
  is first packaged using Zarf, which applies cryptographic signing and hashing
  to ensure that packages are not altered, thereby preserving data integrity.
  Before transmission, Istio enforces mutual TLS (mTLS) for all inter-service
  communications and HTTPS for external access, ensuring that data is encrypted
  and authenticated end-to-end. Additionally, Keycloak and AuthService control
  access to the data preparation process, so only authorized users can trigger
  transmissions.
