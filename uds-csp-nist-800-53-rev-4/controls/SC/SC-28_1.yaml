  Description:

  The information system protects the [Selection (one or more): confidentiality;
  integrity] of [Assignment: organization-defined information at rest].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control addresses the confidentiality and integrity of information at
  rest and covers user information and system information. Information at rest
  refers to the state of information when it is located on storage devices as
  specific components of information systems. System-related information
  requiring protection includes, for example, configurations or rule sets for
  firewalls, gateways, intrusion detection/prevention systems, filtering
  routers, and authenticator content. Organizations may employ different
  mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, including the
  use of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Integrity protection
  can be achieved, for example, by implementing Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM)
  technologies. Organizations may also employ other security controls including,
  for example, secure off-line storage in lieu of online storage when adequate
  protection of information at rest cannot otherwise be achieved and/or
  continuous monitoring to identify malicious code at rest. Related controls:
  AC-3, AC-6, CA-7, CM-3, CM-5, CM-6, PE-3, SC-8, SC-13, SI-3, SI-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing protection of information at rest; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; cryptographic mechanisms and associated configuration
  documentation; list of information at rest requiring confidentiality and
  integrity protections; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  confidentiality and integrity protections for information at rest].

cci-definition: "001199: The information system protects the confidentiality
  and/or integrity of organization-defined information at rest."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  protect the confidentiality and/or integrity of organization-defined
  information at rest. For information system components that have applicable
  STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the
  STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 1199.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation that identifies which information at rest must be protected.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks pertaining to CCI 1199.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to protect the
  confidentiality and/or integrity of organization-defined information at rest.
  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 1199.

test-results: UDS ensures protection of confidentiality and integrity of
  information at rest by employing industry-standard encryption practices.
  Specifically, data at rest, including persistent storage used by platform
  components like Keycloak, Grafana, Loki logs, and any Kubernetes persistent
  volumes, are encrypted using widely accepted, industry-standard cryptographic
  algorithms such as AES-256. Backups managed through Velero can be configured
  for encryption, ensuring data remains secure even when stored externally.
