control-acronym: SC-7(7)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system, in conjunction with a remote device, prevents the
  device from simultaneously establishing non-remote connections with the system
  and communicating via some other connection to resources in external networks.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement is implemented within remote devices (e.g., notebook
  computers) through configuration settings to disable split tunneling in those
  devices, and by preventing those configuration settings from being readily
  configurable by users. This control enhancement is implemented within the
  information system by the detection of split tunneling (or of configuration
  settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device, and by prohibiting
  the connection if the remote device is using split tunneling. Split tunneling
  might be desirable by remote users to communicate with local information
  system resources such as printers/file servers. However, split tunneling would
  in effect allow unauthorized external connections, making the system more
  vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational information. The
  use of VPNs for remote connections, when adequately provisioned with
  appropriate security controls, may provide the organization with sufficient
  assurance that it can effectively treat such connections as non-remote
  connections from the confidentiality and integrity perspective. VPNs thus
  provide a means for allowing non-remote communications paths from remote
  devices. The use of an adequately provisioned VPN does not eliminate the need
  for preventing split tunneling.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; information system design documentation;
  information system hardware and software; information system architecture;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing boundary protection
  capability; automated mechanisms supporting/restricting non-remote
  connections].

  device, prevents the device from simultaneously establishing non-remote
  connections with the system and communicating via some other connection to
  resources in external networks."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  prevent the device from simultaneously establishing non-remote connections
  with the system and communicating via some other connection to resources in
  external networks. For information system components that have applicable
  STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the
  STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 2397.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Current Network diagram.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to prevent the device
  from simultaneously establishing non-remote connections with the system and
  communicating via some other connection to resources in external networks. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 2397.

test-results: "In the context of UDS, the system itself doesnât directly
  control a remote deviceâs network interfaces; however, it enforces secure
  remote access by ensuring that all connections use designated secure channels
  primarily through Istioâs Ingress/Egress Gateways with mutual TLS and strict
  network policies which effectively prevents a remote device from
  simultaneously establishing an unsecured or non-remote connection to external
  resources. To fully meet the controlâs intent, endpoint configurations (such
  as VPN clients configured to disable split tunneling) and organizational
  policies must be applied to the remote device so that when connected to UDS,
  no alternate connection can be used to bypass security controls."
