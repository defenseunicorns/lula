  Description:

  The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined host-based
  boundary protection mechanisms] at [Assignment: organization-defined
  information system components].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Host-based boundary protection mechanisms include, for example, host-based
  firewalls. Information system components employing host-based boundary
  protection mechanisms include, for example, servers, workstations, and mobile
  devices.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; information system design documentation;
  boundary protection hardware and software; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with boundary protection responsibilities; information system users].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing host-based boundary
  protection capabilities].

  DoD has defined the information system components as McAfee Host Intrusion
  Prevention (HIPS).


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically compliant.
assessment-procedures: The organization being inspected/assessed is
  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the information system components as McAfee Host
  Intrusion Prevention (HIPS).

compliance-status: Compliant
test-results: All UDS components that require a host-based boundary protection
  mechanisms are documented in the Security Assessment Plan (SAP) which
  identifies the test targets and test methods.
