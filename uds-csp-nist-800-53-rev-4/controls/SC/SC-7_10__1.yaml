  Description:

  The organization prevents the unauthorized exfiltration of information across
  managed interfaces.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Safeguards implemented by organizations to prevent unauthorized exfiltration
  of information from information systems include, for example: (i) strict
  adherence to protocol formats; (ii) monitoring for beaconing from information
  systems; (iii) monitoring for steganography; (iv) disconnecting external
  network interfaces except when explicitly needed; (v) disassembling and
  reassembling packet headers; and (vi) employing traffic profile analysis to
  detect deviations from the volume/types of traffic expected within
  organizations or call backs to command and control centers. Devices enforcing
  strict adherence to protocol formats include, for example, deep packet
  inspection firewalls and XML gateways. These devices verify adherence to
  protocol formats and specification at the application layer and serve to
  identify vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices operating at the
  network or transport layers. This control enhancement is closely associated
  with cross-domain solutions and system guards enforcing information flow
  requirements. Related control: SI-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing boundary protection
  capability; preventing unauthorized exfiltration of information across managed
  interfaces].

  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements mechanisms
  to prevent the unauthorized exfiltration of information across managed
  interfaces.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated document that describes a mechanisms to prevent the
  unauthorized exfiltration of information across managed interfaces.

  obtains and examines the documented mechanisms to ensure the organization
  being inspected/assessed prevents the unauthorized exfiltration of information
  across managed interfaces.
