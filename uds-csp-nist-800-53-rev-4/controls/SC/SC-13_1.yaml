control-acronym: SC-13
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system implements [Assignment: organization-defined
  cryptographic uses and type of cryptography required for each use] in
  accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
  policies, regulations, and standards.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Cryptography can be employed to support a variety of security solutions
  including, for example, the protection of classified and Controlled
  Unclassified Information, the provision of digital signatures, and the
  enforcement of information separation when authorized individuals have the
  necessary clearances for such information but lack the necessary formal access
  approvals. Cryptography can also be used to support random number generation
  and hash generation. Generally applicable cryptographic standards include
  FIPS-validated cryptography and NSA-approved cryptography. This control does
  not impose any requirements on organizations to use cryptography. However, if
  cryptography is required based on the selection of other security controls,
  organizations define each type of cryptographic use and the type of
  cryptography required (e.g., protection of classified information:
  NSA-approved cryptography; provision of digital signatures: FIPS-validated
  cryptography). Related controls: AC-2, AC-3, AC-7, AC-17, AC-18, AU-9, AU-10,
  CM-11, CP-9, IA-3, IA-7, MA-4, MP-2, MP-4, MP-5, SA-4, SC-8, SC-12, SC-28,
  SI-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing cryptographic protection; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  cryptographic module validation certificates; list of FIPS validated
  cryptographic modules; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with responsibilities for cryptographic protection].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  cryptographic protection].
