control-acronym: SC-28(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to prevent
  unauthorized disclosure and modification of [Assignment: organization-defined
  information] on [Assignment: organization-defined information system
  components].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect the
  confidentiality and integrity of organizational information. The strength of
  mechanism is commensurate with the security category and/or classification of
  the information. This control enhancement applies to significant
  concentrations of digital media in organizational areas designated for media
  storage and also to limited quantities of media generally associated with
  information system components in operational environments (e.g., portable
  storage devices, mobile devices). Organizations have the flexibility to either
  encrypt all information on storage devices (i.e., full disk encryption) or
  encrypt specific data structures (e.g., files, records, or fields).
  Organizations employing cryptographic mechanisms to protect information at
  rest also consider cryptographic key management solutions. Related controls:
  AC-19, SC-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing protection of information at rest; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; cryptographic mechanisms and associated configuration
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Cryptographic mechanisms implementing confidentiality and
  integrity protections for information at rest].

  DoD has defined the information system components as any information system
  components storing data defined in SC-28 (1), 2473.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically compliant.
assessment-procedures: The organization being inspected/assessed is
  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the information system components as any information
  system components storing data defined in SC-28 (1), 2473.
