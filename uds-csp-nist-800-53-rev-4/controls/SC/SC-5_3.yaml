control-acronym: SC-5
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system protects against or limits the effects of the following
  types of denial of service attacks: [Assignment: organization-defined types of
  denial of service attacks or reference to source for such information] by
  employing [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A variety of technologies exist to limit, or in some cases, eliminate the
  effects of denial of service attacks. For example, boundary protection devices
  can filter certain types of packets to protect information system components
  on internal organizational networks from being directly affected by denial of
  service attacks. Employing increased capacity and bandwidth combined with
  service redundancy may also reduce the susceptibility to denial of service
  attacks. Related controls: SC-6, SC-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing denial of service protection; information system design
  documentation; security plan; list of denial of services attacks requiring
  employment of security safeguards to protect against or limit effects of such
  attacks; list of security safeguards protecting against or limiting the
  effects of denial of service attacks; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with incident response responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms protecting against or limiting the
  effects of denial of service attacks].

cci-definition: "002386: The organization defines the security safeguards to be
  employed to protect the information system against, or limit the effects of,
  denial of service attacks."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the security
  safeguards to be employed to protect the information system against, or limit
  the effects of, denial of service attacks. DoD has determined the security
  safeguards are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Threat Model.

  2.) System Security Plan (SSP) or any other documentation that defines
  security safeguards that are employed to protect the information system
  against, or limit the effects of, denial of service attacks.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented security safeguards to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed defines the security safeguards to be
  employed to protect the information system against, or limit the effects of,
  denial of service attacks. DoD has determined the security safeguards are not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
