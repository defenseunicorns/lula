  Description:

  The information system prevents the download and execution of [Assignment:
  organization-defined unacceptable mobile code].


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing mobile code; mobile code usage restrictions, mobile code
  implementation policy and procedures; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with responsibilities for managing mobile code].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms preventing download and execution of
  unacceptable mobile code].

cci: 2459
cci-definition: "002459: The organization defines the unacceptable mobile code
  of which the information system is to prevent download and execution."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents unacceptable
  mobile code of which the information system is to prevent download and
  execution IAW the Protection Profile for Web Browsers and Application SRG.

  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must define IAW the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 2459.

  DoD has determined the unacceptable mobile code is not appropriate to define
  at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Software Configuration Management (SCM) plan that defines
  and documents unacceptable mobile code of which the information system is to
  prevent download and execution.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks pertaining to CCI 2459.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented unacceptable mobile code to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed defines unacceptable mobile code of which the information
  system is to prevent download and execution IAW the Protection Profile for Web
  Browsers and Application SRG.

  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has defined unacceptable
  mobile code IAW the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 2459.

  DoD has determined the unacceptable mobile code is not appropriate to define
  at the Enterprise level.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS is primarily designed
  for secure application deployment and operations within Kubernetes clusters.
  It does not inherently utilize or permit execution of mobile code (such as
  Java applets, ActiveX controls, or scripts downloaded and executed directly by
  user endpoints). Any policies regarding acceptable or unacceptable mobile code
  technologies would be organizationally defined and enforced on client
  endpoints or application-specific components outside the UDS core platform.)
