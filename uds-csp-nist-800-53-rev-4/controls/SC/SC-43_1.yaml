control-acronym: SC-43
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Establishes usage restrictions and implementation guidance for [Assignment:
  organization-defined information system components] based on the potential to
  cause damage to the information system if used maliciously; and

  b. Authorizes, monitors, and controls the use of such components within the
  information system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information system components include hardware, software, or firmware
  components (e.g., Voice Over Internet Protocol, mobile code, digital copiers,
  printers, scanners, optical devices, wireless technologies, mobile devices).
  Related controls: CM-6, SC-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing usage restrictions; usage restrictions; implementation policy and
  procedures; authorization records; information system monitoring records;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for authorizing, monitoring, and
  controlling use of components with usage restrictions; Automated mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing authorizing, monitoring, and controlling use of
  components with usage restrictions].

  DoD has defined the information system components as all information system
  components (through the use of an acceptable use agreement).


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically compliant.
assessment-procedures: The organization being inspected/assessed is
  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the information system components as all information
  system components (through the use of an acceptable use agreement).
