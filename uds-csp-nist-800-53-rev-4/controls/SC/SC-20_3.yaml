control-acronym: SC-20
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system: a. Provides additional data origin authentication and
  integrity verification artifacts along with the authoritative name resolution
  data the system returns in response to external name/address resolution
  queries; and b. Provides the means to indicate the security status of child
  zones and (if the child supports secure resolution services) to enable
  verification of a chain of trust among parent and child domains, when
  operating as part of a distributed, hierarchical namespace.

  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enables external clients including, for example, remote Internet
  clients, to obtain origin authentication and integrity verification assurances
  for the host/service name to network address resolution information obtained
  through the service. Information systems that provide name and address
  resolution services include, for example, domain name system (DNS) servers.
  Additional artifacts include, for example, DNS Security (DNSSEC) digital
  signatures and cryptographic keys. DNS resource records are examples of
  authoritative data. The means to indicate the security status of child zones
  includes, for example, the use of delegation signer resource records in the
  DNS. The DNS security controls reflect (and are referenced from) OMB
  Memorandum 08-23. Information systems that use technologies other than the DNS
  to map between host/service names and network addresses provide other means to
  assure the authenticity and integrity of response data. Related controls:
  AU-10, SC-8, SC-12, SC-13, SC-21, SC-22.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing secure name/address resolution service (authoritative source);
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; other relevant documents or records].

  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with responsibilities for managing DNS].

  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing secure
  name/address resolution service].

  security status of child zones."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the authoritative name
  server software to enable DNSSEC and creates delegation signer (DS) resource
  records for each child zone and place those records in the parent zone. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that determines the name server software configuration files and pertains to
  CCI 1179.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) DNS logs.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: "The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  inspect the configuration files for the presence of Delegation Signer (DS)
  Records for any child domains. Note: This is only applicable for zones with
  child domains. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the
  components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs that determine the name server software configuration files and pertain
  to CCI 1179."
