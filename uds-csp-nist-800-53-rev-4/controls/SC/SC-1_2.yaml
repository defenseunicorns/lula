control-acronym: SC-1
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles]:

  1. A system and communications protection policy that addresses purpose,
  scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among
  organizational entities, and compliance; and

  2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system and
  communications protection policy and associated system and communications
  protection controls; and

  b. Reviews and updates the current:

  1. System and communications protection policy [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency]; and

  2. System and communications protection procedures [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
  effective implementation of selected security controls and control
  enhancements in the SC family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable
  federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
  and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization
  level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures
  unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information
  security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by
  multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The
  procedures can be established for the security program in general and for
  particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
  strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related
  control: PM-9.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy and
  procedures; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and
  communications protection responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].

cci-definition: "002380: The organization defines the personnel or roles to be
  recipients of the procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system
  and communications protection policy and associated system and communications
  protection controls."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents personnel or
  roles to be recipients of the procedures to facilitate the implementation of
  the system and communications protection policy and associated system and
  communications protection controls. The personnel or roles must include at a
  minimum, the ISSM/ISSO. DoD has defined the personnel or roles as at a
  minimum, the ISSO/ISSM.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated procedure documentation that lists all the roles and
  personnel who are to facilitate the implementation of the system and
  communications protection policy and associated system and communications
  protection controls.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented personnel or roles to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed defines the personnel or roles to be
  recipients of the procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system
  and communications protection policy and associated system and communications
  protection controls. The personnel or roles must include at a minimum, the
  ISSM/ISSO. DoD has defined the personnel or roles as at a minimum, the
  ISSO/ISSM.
