control-acronym: SC-23(5)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system only allows the use of [Assignment:
  organization-defined certificate authorities] for verification of the
  establishment of protected sessions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Reliance on certificate authorities (CAs) for the establishment of secure
  sessions includes, for example, the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and/or
  Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates. These certificates, after
  verification by the respective certificate authorities, facilitate the
  establishment of protected sessions between web clients and web servers.
  Related control: SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing session authenticity; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation; list
  of certificate authorities allowed for verification of the establishment of
  protected sessions; information system audit records; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  management of certificate authorities].

  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  allow the use of DoD PKI established certificate authorities for verification
  of the establishment of protected sessions. For information system components
  that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed
  must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 2470. DoD has
  defined the certificate authorities as DoD PKI established certificate
  authorities.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 2470.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to allow the use of DoD
  PKI established certificate authorities for verification of the establishment
  of protected sessions. For information system components that have applicable
  STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates
  the components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 2470. DoD has defined the certificate authorities as
  DoD PKI established certificate authorities.

test-results: "UDS platform uses the Istio Service Mesh, which includes an
  internal certificate authority (Citadel) to manage mutual TLS (mTLS)
  certificates for internal service-to-service sessions. By default, Istioâs
  built-in certificate authority generates certificates to securely verify
  internal communications. However, to fully align with this control
  organizations typically configure Istio to utilize certificates issued by an
  approved certificate authority compliant with DoDI 8520.02."
