  Description:

  The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to [Selection (one
  or more): prevent unauthorized disclosure of information; detect changes to
  information] during transmission unless otherwise protected by [Assignment:
  organization-defined alternative physical safeguards].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Encrypting information for transmission protects information from unauthorized
  disclosure and modification. Cryptographic mechanisms implemented to protect
  information integrity include, for example, cryptographic hash functions which
  have common application in digital signatures, checksums, and message
  authentication codes. Alternative physical security safeguards include, for
  example, protected distribution systems. Related control: SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing transmission confidentiality and integrity; information system
  design documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Cryptographic mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  transmission confidentiality and/or integrity; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing alternative physical safeguards; organizational processes
  for defining and implementing alternative physical safeguards].

  mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information and/or detect
  changes to information during transmission unless otherwise protected by
  organization-defined alternative physical safeguards."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of
  information and detect changes to information during transmission unless
  otherwise protected by Protected Distribution System (PDS). For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  2421. DoD has defined the selection as both prevention of unauthorized
  disclosure and detection of changes to information. DoD has defined the
  alternative physical safeguards as Protected Distribution System (PDS).

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Current Network diagram.

  2.) Signed and dated System Security Plan (SSP).

  3.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to implement
  cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information and
  detect changes to information during transmission unless otherwise protected
  by Protected Distribution System (PDS). For information system components that
  have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 2421. DoD has defined the
  alternative physical safeguards as Protected Distribution System (PDS).

test-results: "The cryptographic mechanisms used (TLS 1.2+/AES) by UDS are
  industry-standard and can be configured to meet federal standards (e.g., using
  FIPS-validated algorithms if needed). Istioâs mTLS and standard HTTPS both
  use protocols that provide end-to-end encryption and integrity. They are
  implemented via well-known libraries (OpenSSL, BoringSSL, etc.) which include
  proper cipher suites."
