control-acronym: SC-8(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to [Selection (one
  or more): prevent unauthorized disclosure of information; detect changes to
  information] during transmission unless otherwise protected by [Assignment:
  organization-defined alternative physical safeguards].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Encrypting information for transmission protects information from unauthorized
  disclosure and modification. Cryptographic mechanisms implemented to protect
  information integrity include, for example, cryptographic hash functions which
  have common application in digital signatures, checksums, and message
  authentication codes. Alternative physical security safeguards include, for
  example, protected distribution systems. Related control: SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing transmission confidentiality and integrity; information system
  design documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Cryptographic mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  transmission confidentiality and/or integrity; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing alternative physical safeguards; organizational processes
  for defining and implementing alternative physical safeguards].

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically compliant.

  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the alternative physical safeguards as Protected
  Distribution System (PDS).
