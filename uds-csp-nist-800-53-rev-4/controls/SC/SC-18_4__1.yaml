control-acronym: SC-18(4)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system prevents the automatic execution of mobile code in
  [Assignment: organization-defined software applications] and enforces
  [Assignment: organization-defined actions] prior to executing the code.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Actions enforced before executing mobile code, include, for example, prompting
  users prior to opening electronic mail attachments. Preventing automatic
  execution of mobile code includes, for example, disabling auto execute
  features on information system components employing portable storage devices
  such as Compact Disks (CDs), Digital Video Disks (DVDs), and Universal Serial
  Bus (USB) devices.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing mobile code; mobile code usage restrictions; mobile code
  implementation policy and procedures; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation; list
  of software applications for which automatic execution of mobile code must be
  prohibited; list of actions required before execution of mobile code; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with responsibilities for managing mobile code].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms preventing automatic execution of
  unacceptable mobile code; automated mechanisms enforcing actions to be taken
  prior to the execution of the mobile code].

cci-definition: "001170: The information system prevents the automatic execution
  of mobile code in organization-defined software applications."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  prevent the automatic execution of unacceptable mobile code in software
  applications defined in CCI 1171.

  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 1170.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks pertaining to CCI 1170.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed configures the
  information system to prevent the automatic execution of unacceptable mobile
  code in software applications defined in CCI 1171.

  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 1170.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS is primarily designed
  for secure application deployment and operations within Kubernetes clusters.
  It does not inherently utilize or permit execution of mobile code (such as
  Java applets, ActiveX controls, or scripts downloaded and executed directly by
  user endpoints). Any policies regarding acceptable or unacceptable mobile code
  technologies would be organizationally defined and enforced on client
  endpoints or application-specific components outside the UDS core platform.)
