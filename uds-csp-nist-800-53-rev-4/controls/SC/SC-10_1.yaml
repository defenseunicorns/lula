control-acronym: SC-10
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system terminates the network connection associated with a
  communications session at the end of the session or after [Assignment:
  organization-defined time period] of inactivity.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies to both internal and external networks. Terminating
  network connections associated with communications sessions include, for
  example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating
  system level, or de-allocating networking assignments at the application level
  if multiple application sessions are using a single, operating system-level
  network connection. Time periods of inactivity may be established by
  organizations and include, for example, time periods by type of network access
  or for specific network accesses.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing network disconnect; information system design documentation;
  security plan; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  network disconnect capability].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  terminate the network connection associated with a communications session at
  the end of the session or after 10 minutes in band management and 15 minutes
  for user sessions. For information system components that have applicable
  STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the
  STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 1133. DoD has defined the time period
  as 10 minutes in band management and 15 minutes for user sessions.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG pertaining to CCI 1133.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to terminate the network
  connection associated with a communications session at the end of the session
  or after 10 minutes in band management and 15 minutes for user sessions. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 1133. DoD has defined the time period as 10 minutes in band management
  and 15 minutes for user sessions.

test-results: UDS leverages centralized authentication provided by Keycloak,
  integrated with AuthService, to enforce session timeouts and inactivity
  thresholds. Keycloak supports configurable idle and maximum session durations,
  automatically terminating user sessions upon logout, session expiration, or
  after a defined period of inactivity. Istio Service Mesh enforces network
  connection timeouts and idle connection management between services,
  automatically closing inactive network connections based on configurable
  policies. These mechanisms together ensure that both user and internal network
  sessions are terminated securely at the end of sessions or after defined
  inactivity periods.
