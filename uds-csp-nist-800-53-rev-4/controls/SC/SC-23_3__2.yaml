control-acronym: SC-23(3)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system generates a unique session identifier for each session
  with [Assignment: organization-defined randomness requirements] and recognizes
  only session identifiers that are system-generated.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement curtails the ability of adversaries from reusing
  previously valid session IDs. Employing the concept of randomness in the
  generation of unique session identifiers helps to protect against brute-force
  attacks to determine future session identifiers. Related control: SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing session authenticity; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  generating and monitoring unique session identifiers; automated mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing randomness requirements].

cci: 1189
cci-definition: "001189: The organization defines randomness requirements for
  generating unique session identifiers."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents randomness
  requirements for generating unique session identifiers. DoD has determined the
  randomness requirements are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation that describes organization-defined
  randomness requirements for generating unique session identifiers.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented randomness requirements to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed defines randomness requirements for
  generating unique session identifiers. DoD has determined the randomness
  requirements are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Defining the appropriate
  level of randomness must be down at the organizational level.)
