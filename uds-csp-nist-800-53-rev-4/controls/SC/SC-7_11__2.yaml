control-acronym: SC-7(11)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system only allows incoming communications from [Assignment:
  organization-defined authorized sources] routed to [Assignment:
  organization-defined authorized destinations].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement provides determinations that source and destination
  address pairs represent authorized/allowed communications. Such determinations
  can be based on several factors including, for example, the presence of
  source/destination address pairs in lists of authorized/allowed
  communications, the absence of address pairs in lists of
  unauthorized/disallowed pairs, or meeting more general rules for
  authorized/allowed source/destination pairs. Related control: AC-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing boundary protection
  capabilities with respect to source/destination address pairs].

cci-definition: "002402: The organization defines the authorized destinations
  for routing inbound communications."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the authorized
  destinations for routing inbound communications. DoD has determined the
  authorized destinations are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated document that defines the authorized destinations for
  routing inbound communications.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented authorized destinations to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed defines the authorized destinations for
  routing inbound communications. DoD has determined the authorized destinations
  are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
