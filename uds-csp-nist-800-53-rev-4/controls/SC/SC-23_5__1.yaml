control-acronym: SC-23(5)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system only allows the use of [Assignment:
  organization-defined certificate authorities] for verification of the
  establishment of protected sessions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Reliance on certificate authorities (CAs) for the establishment of secure
  sessions includes, for example, the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and/or
  Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates. These certificates, after
  verification by the respective certificate authorities, facilitate the
  establishment of protected sessions between web clients and web servers.
  Related control: SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing session authenticity; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation; list
  of certificate authorities allowed for verification of the establishment of
  protected sessions; information system audit records; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  management of certificate authorities].

  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the certificate authorities as DoD PKI established
  certificate authorities.
