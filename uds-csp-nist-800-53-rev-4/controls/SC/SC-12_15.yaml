control-acronym: SC-12
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization establishes and manages cryptographic keys for required
  cryptography employed within the information system in accordance with
  [Assignment: organization-defined requirements for key generation,
  distribution, storage, access, and destruction].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Cryptographic key management and establishment can be performed using manual
  procedures or automated mechanisms with supporting manual procedures.
  Organizations define key management requirements in accordance with applicable
  federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
  and guidance, specifying appropriate options, levels, and parameters.
  Organizations manage trust stores to ensure that only approved trust anchors
  are in such trust stores. This includes certificates with visibility external
  to organizational information systems and certificates related to the internal
  operations of systems. Related controls: SC-13, SC-17.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing cryptographic key establishment and management; information system
  design documentation; cryptographic mechanisms; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; information system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with responsibilities for cryptographic key establishment and/or management].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  cryptographic key establishment and management].

  required cryptography employed within the information system in accordance

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented process to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed manages
  cryptographic keys for required cryptography employed within the information
  system in accordance with requirements for key destruction defined in DoDI
  8520.02 "Public Key Infrastructure and Public Key Enabling" and DoDI 8520.03
  "Identity Authentication for Information Systems." DoD has defined the
  requirements for key destruction as requirements for key destruction defined
  in DoDI 8520.02 "Public Key Infrastructure and Public Key Enabling" and DoDI
  8520.03 "Identity Authentication for Information Systems."

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system protection policy.

  2.) Communications protection policy (reference encryption section).

  3.) Key requirements used for key generation aligned with DoDI 8520.02 "Public
  Key Infrastructure and Public Key Enabling" and DoDI 8520.03 "Identity
  Authentication for Information Systems."
assessment-procedures: The organization being inspected/assessed documents and
  implements a process to manage cryptographic keys for required cryptography
  employed within the information system in accordance with requirements for key
  destruction defined in DoDI 8520.02 "Public Key Infrastructure and Public Key
  Enabling" and DoDI 8520.03 "Identity Authentication for Information Systems."
  DoD has defined the requirements for key destruction as requirements for key
  destruction defined in DoDI 8520.02 "Public Key Infrastructure and Public Key
  Enabling" and DoDI 8520.03 "Identity Authentication for Information Systems."

test-results: "In UDS, cryptographic key destruction is integrated into the key
  lifecycle management process to ensure that once keys reach end-of-life, are
  rotated, or are otherwise no longer required, they are securely and
  irreversibly eliminated in accordance with organization-defined policies and
  DoD requirements. For instance, Istio automatically retires expired mTLS
  certificates and securely purges the associated keys from its certificate
  authority, while Kubernetes Secrets storing sensitive cryptographic material
  are configured to remove keys securely from etcd, ensuring that deleted keys
  cannot be recovered. Keycloakâs key rotation and revocation processes
  enforce the secure destruction of outdated signing keys through controlled
  administrative procedures."
