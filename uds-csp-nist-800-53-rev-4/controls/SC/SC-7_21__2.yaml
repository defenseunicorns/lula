control-acronym: SC-7(21)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs boundary protection mechanisms to separate
  [Assignment: organization-defined information system components] supporting
  [Assignment: organization-defined missions and/or business functions].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations can isolate information system components performing different
  missions and/or business functions. Such isolation limits unauthorized
  information flows among system components and also provides the opportunity to
  deploy greater levels of protection for selected components. Separating system
  components with boundary protection mechanisms provides the capability for
  increased protection of individual components and to more effectively control
  information flows between those components. This type of enhanced protection
  limits the potential harm from cyber attacks and errors. The degree of
  separation provided varies depending upon the mechanisms chosen. Boundary
  protection mechanisms include, for example, routers, gateways, and firewalls
  separating system components into physically separate networks or subnetworks,
  cross-domain devices separating subnetworks, virtualization techniques, and
  encrypting information flows among system components using distinct encryption
  keys. Related controls: CA-9, SC-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; information system design documentation;
  information system hardware and software; enterprise architecture
  documentation; information system architecture; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; information system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the
  capability to separate information system components supporting organizational
  missions and/or business functions].

cci-definition: "002414: The organization defines the missions and/or business
  functions for which boundary protection mechanisms will be employed to
  separate the supporting organization-defined information system components."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the missions
  and/or business functions for which boundary protection mechanisms will be
  employed to separate the supporting organization-defined information system
  components. DoD has determined the missions and/or business functions are not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated document that defines the missions and/or business
  functions for which boundary protection mechanisms will be employed to
  separate the supporting organization-defined information system components.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented missions and/or business functions to
  ensure the organization being inspected/assessed defines the missions and/or
  business functions for which boundary protection mechanisms will be employed
  to separate the supporting organization-defined information system components.
  DoD has determined the missions and/or business functions are not appropriate
  to define at the Enterprise level.
