control-acronym: SC-15
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system:

  a. Prohibits remote activation of collaborative computing devices with the
  following exceptions: [Assignment: organization-defined exceptions where
  remote activation is to be allowed]; and

  b. Provides an explicit indication of use to users physically present at the
  devices.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Collaborative computing devices include, for example, networked white boards,
  cameras, and microphones. Explicit indication of use includes, for example,
  signals to users when collaborative computing devices are activated. Related
  control: AC-21.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing collaborative computing; access control policy and procedures;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with responsibilities for managing collaborative
  computing devices].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  management of remote activation of collaborative computing devices; automated
  mechanisms providing an indication of use of collaborative computing devices].

  DoD has defined the exceptions as dedicated VTC suites located in approved VTC
  locations that are centrally managed.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically compliant.
assessment-procedures: The organization being inspected/assessed is
  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the exceptions as dedicated VTC suites located in
  approved VTC locations that are centrally managed.
