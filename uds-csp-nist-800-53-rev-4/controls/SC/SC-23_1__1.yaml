control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system invalidates session identifiers upon user logout or
  other session termination.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement curtails the ability of adversaries from capturing
  and continuing to employ previously valid session IDs.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing session authenticity; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  session identifier invalidation upon session termination].

  upon user logout or other session termination."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  invalidate session identifiers upon user logout or other session termination.
  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 1185.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to invalidate session
  identifiers upon user logout or other session termination. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization
  conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that
  the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the information
  system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI
  1185.

test-results: UDS leverages Keycloak, integrated with AuthService, to manage
  user sessions securely. Keycloak automatically invalidates session identifiers
  upon explicit user logout, session timeout, or administrator-initiated
  termination of sessions. Upon invalidation, JWT tokens and associated session
  cookies become unusable, effectively preventing reuse or replay attacks. The
  Istio Service Mesh enforces token validation on each request, ensuring that
  terminated or invalidated sessions cannot access system resources after
  termination.
