  Description:

  The organization ensures that the acquisition, development, and use of mobile
  code to be deployed in the information system meets [Assignment:
  organization-defined mobile code requirements].


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing mobile code; mobile code requirements; mobile code usage
  restrictions, mobile code implementation policy and procedures; acquisition
  documentation; acquisition contracts for information system, system component,
  or information system service; system development life cycle documentation;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with responsibilities for managing mobile code; organizational personnel with
  acquisition and contracting responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for the acquisition, development,
  and use of mobile code].

cci: 1168
cci-definition: "001168: The organization defines requirements for the
  acquisition, development, and use of mobile code."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents requirements
  for the acquisition, development, and use of mobile code. The requirements
  must result in the acquisition and development of mobile code which complies
  with the Protection Profile for Web Browsers and Application SRG.

  DoD has determined the requirements are not appropriate to define at the
  Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Software Configuration Management (SCM) plan that defines
  requirements for the acquisition, development, and use of mobile code.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented requirements to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  defines requirements for the acquisition, development, and use of mobile code.

  DoD has determined the requirements are not appropriate to define at the
  Enterprise level.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS is primarily designed
  for secure application deployment and operations within Kubernetes clusters.
  It does not inherently utilize or permit execution of mobile code (such as
  Java applets, ActiveX controls, or scripts downloaded and executed directly by
  user endpoints). Any policies regarding acceptable or unacceptable mobile code
  technologies would be organizationally defined and enforced on client
  endpoints or application-specific components outside the UDS core platform.)
