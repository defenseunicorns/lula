control-acronym: SC-7(11)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system only allows incoming communications from [Assignment:
  organization-defined authorized sources] routed to [Assignment:
  organization-defined authorized destinations].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement provides determinations that source and destination
  address pairs represent authorized/allowed communications. Such determinations
  can be based on several factors including, for example, the presence of
  source/destination address pairs in lists of authorized/allowed
  communications, the absence of address pairs in lists of
  unauthorized/disallowed pairs, or meeting more general rules for
  authorized/allowed source/destination pairs. Related control: AC-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing boundary protection
  capabilities with respect to source/destination address pairs].

cci-definition: "002403: The information system only allows incoming
  communications from organization-defined authorized sources routed to
  organization-defined authorized destinations."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  allow incoming communications from authorized sources defined in SC-7 (11),
  CCI 2401 routed to authorized destinations defined in SC-7 (11), CCI 2402. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 2403.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Organization configuration documentation for the information system to
  allow incoming communications from authorized sources.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.

  3.) Applicable firewall rule set.

  4.) Applicable firewall logs.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to allow incoming
  communications from authorized sources defined in SC-7 (11), CCI 2401 routed
  to authorized destinations defined in SC-7 (11), CCI 2402. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization
  conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that
  the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the information
  system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI
  2403.
