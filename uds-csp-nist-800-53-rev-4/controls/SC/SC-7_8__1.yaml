control-acronym: SC-7(8)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system routes [Assignment: organization-defined internal
  communications traffic] to [Assignment: organization-defined external
  networks] through authenticated proxy servers at managed interfaces.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  External networks are networks outside of organizational control. A proxy
  server is a server (i.e., information system or application) that acts as an
  intermediary for clients requesting information system resources (e.g., files,
  connections, web pages, or services) from other organizational servers. Client
  requests established through an initial connection to the proxy server are
  evaluated to manage complexity and to provide additional protection by
  limiting direct connectivity. Web content filtering devices are one of the
  most common proxy servers providing access to the Internet. Proxy servers
  support logging individual Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) sessions and
  blocking specific Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), domain names, and Internet
  Protocol (IP) addresses. Web proxies can be configured with
  organization-defined lists of authorized and unauthorized websites. Related
  controls: AC-3, AU-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing boundary protection; information system design documentation;
  information system hardware and software; information system architecture;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing traffic management
  through authenticated proxy servers at managed interfaces].

  internal communications traffic to organization-defined external networks
  through authenticated proxy servers at managed interfaces."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  route protocols as designated by PPSM guidance (e.g. HTTPS, HTTP, FTP, SNMP)
  to any network external to the authorization boundary through authenticated
  proxy servers at managed interfaces. For information system components that
  have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 1112. DoD has defined
  the internal communications traffic as protocols as designated by PPSM
  guidance (e.g. HTTPS, HTTP, FTP, SNMP). DoD has defined the external networks
  as any network external to the authorization boundary.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Current Network diagram.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.

  3.) Signed and dated document that describes how the site configures the
  information system to route protocols as designed by PPSM guidance.

  4.) Applicable firewall rule set.

  5.) Applicable firewall logs.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to route protocols as
  designated by PPSM guidance (e.g. HTTPS, HTTP, FTP, SNMP) to any network
  external to the authorization boundary through authenticated proxy servers at
  managed interfaces. For information system components that have applicable
  STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates
  the components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 1112. DoD has defined the internal communications
  traffic as protocols as designated by PPSM guidance (e.g. HTTPS, HTTP, FTP,
  SNMP). DoD has defined the external networks as any network external to the
  authorization boundary.
