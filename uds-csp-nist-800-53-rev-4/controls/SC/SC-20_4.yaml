control-acronym: SC-20
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system: a. Provides additional data origin authentication and
  integrity verification artifacts along with the authoritative name resolution
  data the system returns in response to external name/address resolution
  queries; and b. Provides the means to indicate the security status of child
  zones and (if the child supports secure resolution services) to enable
  verification of a chain of trust among parent and child domains, when
  operating as part of a distributed, hierarchical namespace.

  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enables external clients including, for example, remote Internet
  clients, to obtain origin authentication and integrity verification assurances
  for the host/service name to network address resolution information obtained
  through the service. Information systems that provide name and address
  resolution services include, for example, domain name system (DNS) servers.
  Additional artifacts include, for example, DNS Security (DNSSEC) digital
  signatures and cryptographic keys. DNS resource records are examples of
  authoritative data. The means to indicate the security status of child zones
  includes, for example, the use of delegation signer resource records in the
  DNS. The DNS security controls reflect (and are referenced from) OMB
  Memorandum 08-23. Information systems that use technologies other than the DNS
  to map between host/service names and network addresses provide other means to
  assure the authenticity and integrity of response data. Related controls:
  AU-10, SC-8, SC-12, SC-13, SC-21, SC-22.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures
  addressing secure name/address resolution service (authoritative source);
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; other relevant documents or records].

  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with responsibilities for managing DNS].

  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing secure
  name/address resolution service].

cci-definition: "001663: Provide the means to enable verification of a chain of
  trust among parent and child domains (if the child supports secure resolution
  services), when operating as part of a distributed, hierarchical namespace."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed installs and utilizes software
  capable of validating the chain of trust (Examples of software include dig,
  dnsviz, dnssec-debugger, dnssec validator for Mozilla, etc.). For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  1663.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) DNS logs.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  utilizes DNSSEC diagnostic tools, such as dig, and performs queries which will
  exercise the data flow path for authoritative name resolution services where
  parent and child domains exist. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs that pertains to CCI 1663.
