  Description:

  The organization plans and coordinates security-related activities affecting
  the information system with [Assignment: organization-defined individuals or
  groups] before conducting such activities in order to reduce the impact on
  other organizational entities.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Security-related activities include, for example, security assessments,
  audits, hardware and software maintenance, patch management, and contingency
  plan testing. Advance planning and coordination includes emergency and
  nonemergency (i.e., planned or nonurgent unplanned) situations. The process
  defined by organizations to plan and coordinate security-related activities
  can be included in security plans for information systems or other documents,
  as appropriate. Related controls: CP-4, IR-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security planning policy; access control policy;
  contingency planning policy; procedures addressing security-related activity
  planning for the information system; security plan for the information system;
  contingency plan for the information system; information system design
  documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security planning and
  plan implementation responsibilities; organizational individuals or groups
  with whom security-related activities are to be planned and coordinated;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].
