control-acronym: PL-4
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Establishes and makes readily available to individuals requiring access to
  the information system, the rules that describe their responsibilities and
  expected behavior with regard to information and information system usage;

  b. Receives a signed acknowledgment from such individuals, indicating that
  they have read, understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior,
  before authorizing access to information and the information system;

  c. Reviews and updates the rules of behavior [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency]; and

  d. Requires individuals who have signed a previous version of the rules of
  behavior to read and resign when the rules of behavior are revised/updated.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement applies to organizational users. Organizations
  consider rules of behavior based on individual user roles and
  responsibilities, differentiating, for example, between rules that apply to
  privileged users and rules that apply to general users. Establishing rules of
  behavior for some types of non-organizational users including, for example,
  individuals who simply receive data/information from federal information
  systems, is often not feasible given the large number of such users and the
  limited nature of their interactions with the systems. Rules of behavior for
  both organizational and non-organizational users can also be established in
  AC-8, System Use Notification. PL-4 b. (the signed acknowledgement portion of
  this control) may be satisfied by the security awareness training and
  role-based security training programs conducted by organizations if such
  training includes rules of behavior. Organizations can use electronic
  signatures for acknowledging rules of behavior. Related controls: AC-2, AC-6,
  AC-8, AC-9, AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, AC-20, AT-2, AT-3, CM-11, IA-2, IA-4, IA-5,
  MP-7, PS-6, PS-8, SA-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security planning policy; procedures addressing rules
  of behavior for information system users; rules of behavior; signed
  acknowledgements; records for rules of behavior reviews and updates; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  establishing, reviewing, and updating rules of behavior; organizational
  personnel who are authorized users of the information system and have signed
  and resigned rules of behavior; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for establishing, reviewing,
  disseminating, and updating rules of behavior; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing the establishment, review, dissemination, and update of
  rules of behavior].

  access to information and the information system."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will obtain signed acknowledgment
  (paper or electronic signature) from individuals indicating that they have
  read, understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior, before
  authorizing access to information and the information system.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed acceptable use policy (AUP) acknowledgements.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains a list of individuals with active accounts and validates the existence
  of signed acknowledgements (paper or electronic signature) of the
  organizational AUP associated with a sampling of individuals selected from the
  list.

  typically provides an Acceptable Use Policy that is shared across their
  organization to meet their security needs in the Systems Security Plan.)
