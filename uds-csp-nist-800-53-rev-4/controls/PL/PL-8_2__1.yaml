control-acronym: PL-8(2)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization requires that [Assignment: organization-defined security
  safeguards] allocated to [Assignment: organization-defined locations and
  architectural layers] are obtained from different suppliers.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Different information technology products have different strengths and
  weaknesses. Providing a broad spectrum of products complements the individual
  offerings. For example, vendors offering malicious code protection typically
  update their products at different times, often developing solutions for known
  viruses, Trojans, or worms according to their priorities and development
  schedules. By having different products at different locations (e.g., server,
  boundary, desktop) there is an increased likelihood that at least one will
  detect the malicious code. Related control: SA-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security planning policy; procedures addressing
  information security architecture development; enterprise architecture
  documentation; information security architecture documentation; security plan
  for the information system; security CONOPS for the information system; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security planning and
  plan implementation responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security architecture development responsibilities; organizational
  personnel with acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for obtaining information
  security safeguards from different suppliers].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed obtains from different suppliers
  security safeguards defined in PL-8 (1), CCIs 3083 and 3084 allocated to
  locations and architectural layers defined in PL-8 (1) CCIs 3085 and 3086.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Evidence of procurement records defined in PL-8 (1), CCIs 3083 and 3084
  allocated to locations and architectural layers defined in PL-8 (1) CCIs 3085
  and 3086.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines procurement records to ensure that different suppliers
  are used to procure security safeguards defined in PL-8 (1), CCIs 3083 and
  3084 allocated to locations and architectural layers defined in PL-8 (1) CCIs
  3085 and 3086.
