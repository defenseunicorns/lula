control-acronym: PL-8
control-information: "Description:

  The organization:

  a. Develops an information security architecture for the information system
  that:

  1. Describes the overall philosophy, requirements, and approach to be taken
  with regard to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
  organizational information;

  2. Describes how the information security architecture is integrated into and
  supports the enterprise architecture; and

  3. Describes any information security assumptions about, and dependencies on,
  external services;

  b. Reviews and updates the information security architecture [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] to reflect updates in the enterprise
  architecture; and

  c. Ensures that planned information security architecture changes are
  reflected in the security plan, the security Concept of Operations (CONOPS),
  and organizational procurements/acquisitions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control addresses actions taken by organizations in the design and
  development of information systems. The information security architecture at
  the individual information system level is consistent with and complements the
  more global, organization-wide information security architecture described in
  PM-7 that is integral to and developed as part of the enterprise architecture.
  The information security architecture includes an architectural description,
  the placement/allocation of security functionality (including security
  controls), security-related information for external interfaces, information
  being exchanged across the interfaces, and the protection mechanisms
  associated with each interface. In addition, the security architecture can
  include other important security-related information, for example, user roles
  and access privileges assigned to each role, unique security requirements, the
  types of information processed, stored, and transmitted by the information
  system, restoration priorities of information and information system services,
  and any other specific protection needs.

  In todayâs modern architecture, it is becoming less common for organizations
  to control all information resources. There are going to be key dependencies
  on external information services and service providers. Describing such
  dependencies in the information security architecture is important to
  developing a comprehensive mission/business protection strategy. Establishing,
  developing, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control, a
  baseline configuration for organizational information systems is critical to
  implementing and maintaining an effective information security architecture.
  The development of the information security architecture is coordinated with
  the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) to
  ensure that security controls needed to support privacy requirements are
  identified and effectively implemented. PL-8 is primarily directed at
  organizations (i.e., internally focused) to help ensure that organizations
  develop an information security architecture for the information system, and
  that the security architecture is integrated with or tightly coupled to the
  enterprise architecture through the organization-wide information security
  architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily directed at external information
  technology product/system developers and integrators (although SA-17 could be
  used internally within organizations for in-house system development). SA-17,
  which is complementary to PL-8, is selected when organizations outsource the
  development of information systems or information system components to
  external entities, and there is a need to demonstrate/show consistency with
  the organization's enterprise architecture and information security
  architecture. Related controls: CM-2, CM-6, PL-2, PM-7, SA-5, SA-17, Appendix
  J.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security planning policy; procedures addressing
  information security architecture development; procedures addressing
  information security architecture reviews and updates; enterprise architecture
  documentation; information security architecture documentation; security plan
  for the information system; security CONOPS for the information system;
  records of information security architecture reviews and updates; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security planning and
  plan implementation responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security architecture development responsibilities; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for developing, reviewing, and
  updating the information security architecture; automated mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing the development, review, and update of the
  information security architecture]."
