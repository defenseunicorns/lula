control-acronym: CA-3(3)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization prohibits the direct connection of an [Assignment:
  organization-defined unclassified, non-national security system] to an
  external network without the use of [Assignment: organization-defined boundary
  protection device].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations typically do not have control over external networks (e.g., the
  Internet). Approved boundary protection devices (e.g., routers, firewalls)
  mediate communications (i.e., information flows) between unclassified
  non-national security systems and external networks. This control enhancement
  is required for organizations processing, storing, or transmitting Controlled
  Unclassified Information (CUI).


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing
  information system connections; system and communications protection policy;
  information system interconnection security agreements; security plan;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; security assessment report; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  managing direct connections to external networks; network administrators;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities; personnel
  managing directly connected external networks].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting the management of external
  network connections].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] Privacy (Confidentiality Impact Level: Moderate) Overlay:
  Boundary protection devices protect systems containing PII from unauthorized
  access by individuals outside the organization. A firewall is such a boundary
  protection device.

cci-definition: "002075: The organization prohibits the direct connection of an
  organization-defined unclassified, non-national security system to an external
  network without the use of organization-defined boundary protection device."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed does not connect any national
  security systems to an external network without the use of protection devices
  defined in CA-3 (3), CCI 2077.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Network topology diagram
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines network topology diagrams and examines the information
  system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed does not connect
  any national security systems to an external network without the use of
  protection devices defined in CA-3 (3), CCI 2077.
