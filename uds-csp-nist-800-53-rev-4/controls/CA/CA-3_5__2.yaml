control-acronym: CA-3(5)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs [Selection: allow-all, deny-by-exception; deny-all,
  permit-by-exception] policy for allowing [Assignment: organization-defined
  information systems] to connect to external information systems.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations can constrain information system connectivity to external
  domains (e.g., websites) by employing one of two policies with regard to such
  connectivity: (i) allow-all, deny by exception, also known as blacklisting
  (the weaker of the two policies); or (ii) deny-all, allow by exception, also
  known as whitelisting (the stronger of the two policies). For either policy,
  organizations determine what exceptions, if any, are acceptable. Related
  control: CM-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing
  information system connections; system and communications protection policy;
  information system interconnection agreements; security plan; information
  system design documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; security assessment report; information system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  managing connections to external information systems; network administrators;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing restrictions on external
  system connections].

  DoD has defined the information systems as any systems requiring external

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically Compliant
assessment-procedures: The organization being inspected/assessed is
  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the information systems as any systems requiring
  external connectivity.
