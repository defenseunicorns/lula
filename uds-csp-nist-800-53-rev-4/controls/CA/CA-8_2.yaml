  Description:

  The organization conducts penetration testing [Assignment:organization-defined
  frequency] on [Assignment: organization-defined information systems or system
  components].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted on
  information systems or individual system components to identify
  vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries. Such testing can be
  used to either validate vulnerabilities or determine the degree of resistance
  organizational information systems have to adversaries within a set of
  specified constraints (e.g., time, resources, and/or skills). Penetration
  testing attempts to duplicate the actions of adversaries in carrying out
  hostile cyber attacks against organizations and provides a more in-depth
  analysis of security-related weaknesses/deficiencies. Organizations can also
  use the results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration testing
  activities. Penetration testing can be conducted on the hardware, software, or
  firmware components of an information system and can exercise both physical
  and technical security controls. A standard method for penetration testing
  includes, for example: (i) pretest analysis based on full knowledge of the
  target system; (ii) pretest identification of potential vulnerabilities based
  on pretest analysis; and (iii) testing designed to determine exploitability of
  identified vulnerabilities. All parties agree to the rules of engagement
  before the commencement of penetration testing scenarios. Organizations
  correlate the penetration testing rules of engagement with the tools,
  techniques, and procedures that are anticipated to be employed by adversaries
  carrying out attacks. Organizational risk assessments guide decisions on the
  level of independence required for personnel conducting penetration testing.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security assessment and authorization policy;
  procedures addressing penetration testing; security plan; security assessment
  plan; penetration test report; security assessment report; security assessment
  evidence; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security assessment
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities, system/network administrators].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the frequency
  for conducting penetration testing on organization-defined information systems
  or system components. DoD has determined the frequency is not appropriate to
  define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP defining the frequency for conducting penetration
  testing on organization-defined information systems or system components

  2.) Penetration testing results
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented frequency to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed defines the frequency for conducting penetration testing on
  organization-defined information systems or system components. DoD has
  determined the frequency is not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The UDS technology stack
  does not conduct penetration testing or provide tools specifically for
  penetration testing. The responsibility for defining the frequency and
  conducting penetration testing on organization-defined information systems or
  system components lies with the organization. The organization must define and
  document the frequency for conducting penetration testing in accordance with
  their organizational requirements. This includes maintaining a record of
  penetration test results and ensuring that testing is conducted at the defined
  intervals.)
