  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Assigns a senior-level executive or manager as the authorizing official for
  the information system;

  b. Ensures that the authorizing official authorizes the information system for
  processing before commencing operations; and

  c. Updates the security authorization [Assignment: organization - defined
  frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Security authorizations are official management decisions, conveyed through
  authorization decision documents, by senior organizational officials or
  executives (i.e., authorizing officials) to authorize operation of information
  systems and to explicitly accept the risk to organizational operations and
  assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the
  implementation of agreed-upon security controls. Authorizing officials provide
  budgetary oversight for organizational information systems or assume
  responsibility for the mission/business operations supported by those systems.
  The security authorization process is an inherently federal responsibility and
  therefore, authorizing officials must be federal employees. Through the
  security authorization process, authorizing officials assume responsibility
  and are accountable for security risks associated with the operation and use
  of organizational information systems. Accordingly, authorizing officials are
  in positions with levels of authority commensurate with understanding and
  accepting such information security-related risks. OMB policy requires that
  organizations conduct ongoing authorizations of information systems by
  implementing continuous monitoring programs. Continuous monitoring programs
  can satisfy three-year reauthorization requirements, so separate
  reauthorization processes are not necessary. Through the employment of
  comprehensive continuous monitoring processes, critical information contained
  in authorization packages (i.e., security plans, security assessment reports,
  and plans of action and milestones) is updated on an ongoing basis, providing
  authorizing officials and information system owners with an up-to-date status
  of the security state of organizational information systems and environments
  of operation. To reduce the administrative cost of security reauthorization,
  authorizing officials use the results of continuous monitoring processes to
  the maximum extent possible as the basis for rendering reauthorization
  decisions. Related controls: CA-2, CA-7, PM-9, PM-10.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security assessment and authorization policy;
  procedures addressing security authorization; security authorization package
  (including security plan; security assessment report; plan of action and
  milestones; authorization statement); other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security authorization
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms that facilitate security
  authorizations and updates].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will ensure that an authorization
  document (e.g. authorization to operate (ATO), interim authorization to
  operate (IATO)) has been issued by the authorizing official (AO) prior to
  placing the information system into an operational status.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SOP/TTP, which ensures the information system is
  authorized prior to being placed into operational status
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the authorization document to ensure the information
  system is authorized prior to being placed into operational status.
