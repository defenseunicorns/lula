control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs assessors or assessment teams with [Assignment:
  organization-defined level of independence] to monitor the security controls
  in the information system on an ongoing basis.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations can maximize the value of assessments of security controls
  during the continuous monitoring process by requiring that such assessments be
  conducted by assessors or assessment teams with appropriate levels of
  independence based on continuous monitoring strategies. Assessor independence
  provides a degree of impartiality to the monitoring process. To achieve such
  impartiality, assessors should not: (i) create a mutual or conflicting
  interest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted;
  (ii) assess their own work; (iii) act as management or employees of the
  organizations they are serving; or (iv) place themselves in advocacy positions
  for the organizations acquiring their services.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.
