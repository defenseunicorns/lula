  Description:

  The organization accepts the results of an assessment of [Assignment:
  organization-defined information system] performed by [Assignment:
  organization-defined external organization] when the assessment meets
  [Assignment: organization-defined requirements].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations may often rely on assessments of specific information systems by
  other (external) organizations. Utilizing such existing assessments (i.e.,
  reusing existing assessment evidence) can significantly decrease the time and
  resources required for organizational assessments by limiting the amount of
  independent assessment activities that organizations need to perform. The
  factors that organizations may consider in determining whether to accept
  assessment results from external organizations can vary. Determinations for
  accepting assessment results can be based on, for example, past assessment
  experiences one organization has had with another organization, the reputation
  that organizations have with regard to assessments, the level of detail of
  supporting assessment documentation provided, or mandates imposed upon
  organizations by federal legislation, policies, or directives.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security assessment and authorization policy;
  procedures addressing security assessments; security plan; security assessment
  requirements; security assessment plan; security assessment report; security
  assessment evidence; plan of action and milestones; other relevant documents
  or records].

  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; personnel performing security assessments for the specified
  external organization].

cci-definition: "002067: The organization defines the information systems for
  which they will accept the results of an assessment performed by an external
  organization."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the
  information systems for which they will accept the results of an assessment
  performed by an external organization. DoD has determined the information
  systems are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation accepting the results of an assessment performed by an
  external organization.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented information systems to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed defines the information systems for
  which they will accept the results of an assessment performed by an external
  organization. DoD has determined the information systems are not appropriate
  to define at the Enterprise level.
