control-acronym: CA-9
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Authorizes internal connections of [Assignment: organization-defined
  information system components or classes of components] to the information
  system; and

  b. Documents, for each internal connection, the interface characteristics,
  security requirements, and the nature of the information communicated.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies to connections between organizational information systems
  and (separate) constituent system components (i.e., intra-system connections)
  including, for example, system connections with mobile devices,
  notebook/desktop computers, printers, copiers, facsimile machines, scanners,
  sensors, and servers. Instead of authorizing each individual internal
  connection, organizations can authorize internal connections for a class of
  components with common characteristics and/or configurations, for example, all
  digital printers, scanners, and copiers with a specified processing, storage,
  and transmission capability or all smart phones with a specific baseline
  configuration. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, AC-18, AC-19, AU-2, AU-12, CA-7,
  CM-2, IA-3, SC-7, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing
  information system connections; system and communications protection policy;
  security plan; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; list of components or
  classes of components authorized as internal system connections; security
  assessment report; information system audit records; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  developing, implementing, or authorizing internal system connections;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) SOP/TTP security requirements

  2.) Network topology diagram
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented security requirements as well as the
  network topology to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  documents, for each internal connection, the security requirements.

test-results: Defense Unicorns provides ports, protocols, and services used and
  their component connections in the architecture diagram. UDS provides robust
  technical capabilities to explicitly define and authorize internal connections
  between information system components. Specifically, UDS leverages
  Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with OpenTofu and enforces connection
  authorization through Istio Service Mesh and the policy engine Pepr, allowing
  the organization to clearly specify permitted internal connections between
  Kubernetes components, microservices, containers, and supporting
  infrastructure.
