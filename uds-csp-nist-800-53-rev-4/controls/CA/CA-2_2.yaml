control-acronym: CA-2
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Develops a security assessment plan that describes the scope of the
  assessment including:

  1. Security controls and control enhancements under assessment;

  2. Assessment procedures to be used to determine security control
  effectiveness; and

  3. Assessment environment, assessment team, and assessment roles and
  responsibilities;

  b. Assesses the security controls in the information system and its
  environment of operation [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to
  determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly,
  operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to
  meeting established security requirements;

  c. Produces a security assessment report that documents the results of the
  assessment; and

  d. Provides the results of the security control assessment to [Assignment:
  organization-defined individuals or roles].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations assess security controls in organizational information systems
  and the environments in which those systems operate as part of: (i) initial
  and ongoing security authorizations; (ii) FISMA annual assessments; (iii)
  continuous monitoring; and (iv) system development life cycle activities.
  Security assessments: (i) ensure that information security is built into
  organizational information systems; (ii) identify weaknesses and deficiencies
  early in the development process; (iii) provide essential information needed
  to make risk-based decisions as part of security authorization processes; and
  (iv) ensure compliance to vulnerability mitigation procedures. Assessments are
  conducted on the implemented security controls from Appendix F (main catalog)
  and Appendix G (Program Management controls) as documented in System Security
  Plans and Information Security Program Plans. Organizations can use other
  types of assessment activities such as vulnerability scanning and system
  monitoring to maintain the security posture of information systems during the
  entire life cycle. Security assessment reports document assessment results in
  sufficient detail as deemed necessary by organizations, to determine the
  accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the security controls are
  implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired
  outcome with respect to meeting security requirements. The FISMA requirement
  for assessing security controls at least annually does not require additional
  assessment activities to those activities already in place in organizational
  security authorization processes. Security assessment results are provided to
  the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being
  conducted. For example, assessments conducted in support of security
  authorization decisions are provided to authorizing officials or authorizing
  official designated representatives.

  To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment
  results from the following sources: (i) initial or ongoing information system
  authorizations; (ii) continuous monitoring; or (iii) system development life
  cycle activities. Organizations ensure that security assessment results are
  current, relevant to the determination of security control effectiveness, and
  obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing
  security control assessment results can be reused to the extent that the
  results are still valid and can also be supplemented with additional
  assessments as needed. Subsequent to initial authorizations and in accordance
  with OMB policy, organizations assess security controls during continuous
  monitoring. Organizations establish the frequency for ongoing security control
  assessments in accordance with organizational continuous monitoring
  strategies. Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts provide useful examples
  of vulnerability mitigation procedures. External audits (e.g., audits by
  external entities such as regulatory agencies) are outside the scope of this
  control. Related controls: CA-5, CA-6, CA-7, PM-9, RA-5, SA-11, SA-12, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  The organization being inspected/assessed will ensure the Security Plan
  identifies the security controls and control enhancements under assessment.
  *Comment* The items required within this control are being split into the
  security plan and security assessment report to eliminate creation of an
  additional artifact.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Security Assessment Plan, referencing section which
  identifies the security controls and control enhancements under assessment
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains the security assessment plan to verify the plan identifies the
  security controls and those control enhancements under assessment.
