control-acronym: RA-2
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Categorizes information and the information system in accordance with
  applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
  standards, and guidance;

  b. Documents the security categorization results (including supporting
  rationale) in the security plan for the information system; and

  c. Ensures that the security categorization decision is reviewed and approved
  by the authorizing official or authorizing official designated representative.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Clearly defined authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective
  security categorization decisions. Security categories describe the potential
  adverse impacts to organizational operations, organizational assets, and
  individuals if organizational information and information systems are
  comprised through a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
  Organizations conduct the security categorization process as an
  organization-wide activity with the involvement of chief information officers,
  senior information security officers, information system owners,
  mission/business owners, and information owners/stewards. Organizations also
  consider the potential adverse impacts to other organizations and, in
  accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and Homeland Security Presidential
  Directives, potential national-level adverse impacts. Security categorization
  processes carried out by organizations facilitate the development of
  inventories of information assets, and along with CM-8, mappings to specific
  information system components where information is processed, stored, or
  transmitted. Related controls: CM-8, MP-4, RA-3, SC-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Risk assessment policy; security planning policy and
  procedures; procedures addressing security categorization of organizational
  information and information systems; security plan; security categorization
  documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security categorization
  and risk assessment responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for security categorization].

cci-definition: "001047: The organization ensures the security categorization
  decision is reviewed and approved by the authorizing official or authorizing
  official designated representative."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  IAW CNSSI 1253 to ensure the security categorization decision is reviewed and
  approved by the authorizing official or authorizing official designated
  representative.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation that outlines the organizations process for
  security categorization.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed ensures the security categorization decision is reviewed
  and approved by the authorizing official or authorizing official designated
  representative.
