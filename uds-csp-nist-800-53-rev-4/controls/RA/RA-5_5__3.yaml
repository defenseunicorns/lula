control-acronym: RA-5(5)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system implements privileged access authorization to
  [Assignment: organization-identified information system components] for
  selected [Assignment: organization-defined vulnerability scanning activities].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  In certain situations, the nature of the vulnerability scanning may be more
  intrusive or the information system component that is the subject of the
  scanning may contain highly sensitive information. Privileged access
  authorization to selected system components facilitates more thorough
  vulnerability scanning and also protects the sensitive nature of such
  scanning.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Risk assessment policy; procedures addressing
  vulnerability scanning; security plan; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; list of information system components for vulnerability
  scanning; personnel access authorization list; authorization credentials;
  access authorization records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with vulnerability scanning
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel
  responsible for access control to the information system; organizational
  personnel responsible for configuration management of the information system;
  system developers; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for vulnerability scanning;
  organizational processes for access control; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing access control; automated mechanisms/tools supporting
  and/or implementing vulnerability scanning].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the
  vulnerability scanning activities in which the information system implements
  privileged access authorization to organization-identified information system
  components. DoD has determined the vulnerability scanning activities are not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP).

  2.) Reference to system security plan (SSP) section pertaining to the roles
  and responsibilities of vulnerability scanning.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented vulnerability scanning activities to
  ensure the organization being inspected/assessed defines the vulnerability
  scanning activities in which the information system implements privileged
  access authorization to organization-identified information system components.
  DoD has determined the vulnerability scanning activities are not appropriate
  to define at the Enterprise level.

test-results: UDS defines the vulnerability scanning activities in which the
  system implements privileged access authorization by assigning the appropriate
  functions or actions in the role assigned. This ensures on the required
  actions are executed by a non-human entity and are programmatically defined
  while also auditable through logs.
