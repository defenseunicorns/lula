control-acronym: PE-13
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs and maintains fire suppression and detection
  devices/systems for the information system that are supported by an
  independent energy source.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies primarily to facilities containing concentrations of
  information system resources including, for example, data centers, server
  rooms, and mainframe computer rooms. Fire suppression and detection
  devices/systems include, for example, sprinkler systems, handheld fire
  extinguishers, fixed fire hoses, and smoke detectors.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing fire protection; fire suppression and detection
  devices/systems; fire suppression and detection devices/systems documentation;
  test records of fire suppression and detection devices/systems; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  fire detection and suppression devices/systems; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing fire
  suppression/detection devices/systems].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP
  Moderate Baseline, Rev 4

cci-definition: "000965: The organization employs and maintains fire suppression
  and detection devices/systems for the information system that are supported by
  an independent energy source."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed must implement and maintain fire
  suppression and detection devices/systems for the information system that are
  supported by an independent energy source. An independent energy source is
  some source other than the primary energy source for that facility. Examples
  include sprinkler systems, hand held fire extinguishers, fixed fire hoses, and
  smoke detectors.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation that proves that the fire suppression and detection
  devices/systems for the information system that are supported by an
  independent energy source.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  will conduct visual observation and interview organizational personnel with
  responsibilities for fire detection and suppression devices/systems. The
  purpose of the reviews and interviews is to validate the fire suppression and
  detection devices/systems for the information system are supported by an
  independent energy source.
