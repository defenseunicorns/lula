control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization restricts unescorted access to the facility where the
  information system resides to personnel with [Selection (one or more):
  security clearances for all information contained within the system; formal
  access authorizations for all information contained within the system; need
  for access to all information contained within the system; [Assignment:
  organization-defined credentials]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Due to the highly sensitive nature of classified information stored within
  certain facilities, it is important that individuals lacking sufficient
  security clearances, access approvals, or need to know, be escorted by
  individuals with appropriate credentials to ensure that such information is
  not exposed or otherwise compromised. Related controls: PS-2, PS-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing physical access authorizations; authorized personnel
  access list; security clearances; access authorizations; access credentials;
  physical access control logs or records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with physical access
  authorization responsibilities; organizational personnel with physical access
  to information system facility; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for physical access
  authorizations; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing physical
  access authorizations].

cci: 2914
cci-definition: "002914: The organization defines the credentials required for
  personnel to have unescorted access to the facility where the information
  system resides."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the
  credentials required for personnel to have unescorted access to the facility
  where the information system resides. DoD has determined the credentials are
  not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation on the credentials required for personnel to have unescorted
  access to facility
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented credentials to ensure the organization
  being inspected/assessed defines the credentials required for personnel to
  have unescorted access to the facility where the information system resides.
  DoD has determined the credentials are not appropriate to define at the
  Enterprise level.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Physical access controls,
  monitoring, device protection, etc., must be managed in the data center, cloud
  facility, or on-premise environment and are not functions of UDS. UDS assumes
  the physical environment is secured per organizational policy.)
