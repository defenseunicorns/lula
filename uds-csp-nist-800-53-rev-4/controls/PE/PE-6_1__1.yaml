control-acronym: PE-6(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization monitors physical intrusion alarms and surveillance
  equipment.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing physical access monitoring; security plan; physical
  access logs or records; physical access monitoring records; physical access
  log reviews; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with physical access
  monitoring responsibilities; organizational personnel with incident response
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for monitoring physical intrusion
  alarms and surveillance equipment; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing physical access monitoring; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing physical intrusion alarms and surveillance equipment].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP
  Moderate Baseline, Rev 4

cci-definition: "000942: The organization monitors physical intrusion alarms and
  surveillance equipment."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will actively monitor physical
  intrusion alarms and surveillance equipment.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Physical security incident response policy
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  will observe and interview security personnel conducting monitoring activities
  to validate the organization is actively monitoring all physical intrusion
  alarms and surveillance equipment.
