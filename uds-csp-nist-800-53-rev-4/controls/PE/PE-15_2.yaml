control-acronym: PE-15
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization protects the information system from damage resulting from
  water leakage by providing master shutoff or isolation valves that are
  accessible, working properly, and known to key personnel.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies primarily to facilities containing concentrations of
  information system resources including, for example, data centers, server
  rooms, and mainframe computer rooms. Isolation valves can be employed in
  addition to or in lieu of master shutoff valves to shut off water supplies in
  specific areas of concern, without affecting entire organizations. Related
  control: AT-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing water damage protection; facility housing the
  information system; master shutoff valves; list of key personnel with
  knowledge of location and activation procedures for master shutoff valves for
  the plumbing system; master shutoff valve documentation; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  information system environmental controls; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Master water-shutoff valves; organizational process for
  activating master water-shutoff].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP
  Moderate Baseline, Rev 4

cci-definition: "000978: The organization protects the information system from
  damage resulting from water leakage by providing master shutoff or isolation
  valves that are working properly."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will ensure that master shutoff
  valves are working properly and have been inspected by the appropriate
  organization (e.g., fire marshal, department of public works).


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Evidence of functioning accessible master shutoff valves
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  will visually inspect master shutoff valve inspection documentation (e.g.,
  inspection form, tag attached to valve).
