control-acronym: PE-5
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization controls physical access to information system output devices
  to prevent unauthorized individuals from obtaining the output.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Controlling physical access to output devices includes, for example, placing
  output devices in locked rooms or other secured areas and allowing access to
  authorized individuals only, and placing output devices in locations that can
  be monitored by organizational personnel. Monitors, printers, copiers,
  scanners, facsimile machines, and audio devices are examples of information
  system output devices. Related controls: PE-2, PE-3, PE-4, PE-18.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing access control for display medium; facility layout of
  information system components; actual displays from information system
  components; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with physical access control
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for access control to output
  devices; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing access control to
  output devices].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP
  Moderate Baseline, Rev 4

cci: 937
cci-definition: "000937: The organization controls physical access to
  information system output devices to prevent unauthorized individuals from
  obtaining the output."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will identify, document, and execute
  any additional access controls required for output devices above and beyond
  physical access controls already in place for the facility IAW DoD 5200.08-R
  and DoD 5200.01-M (Volumes 1-4).


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Stickers/signs indicating highest classification of output from device on
  printers, copiers, fax, etc.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the list of additional access controls for output
  devices. Physical inspection is required to ensure these access controls are
  properly implemented.
