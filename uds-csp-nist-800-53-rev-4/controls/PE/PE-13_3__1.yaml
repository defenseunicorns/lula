control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs an automatic fire suppression capability for the
  information system when the facility is not staffed on a continuous basis.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing fire protection; fire suppression and detection
  devices/systems documentation; facility housing the information system; alarm
  service-level agreements; test records of fire suppression and detection
  devices/systems; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  fire detection and suppression devices/systems; organizational personnel with
  responsibilities for providing automatic notifications of any activation of
  fire suppression devices/systems to appropriate personnel, roles, and
  emergency responders; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing fire
  suppression devices/systems; activation of fire suppression devices/systems
  (simulated)].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP
  Moderate Baseline, Rev 4

cci: 968
cci-definition: "000968: The organization employs an automatic fire suppression
  capability for the information system when the facility is not staffed on a
  continuous basis."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed must implement and maintain an
  automatic fire suppression capability that is fully operational when the
  facility is not staffed on a continuous basis.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation/audit trail of visual inspections of fire suppression
  systems with safety personnel
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  conducts visual inspections and interviews physical security/safety personnel
  to validate the organization has installed and implemented an automatic fire
  suppression capability which is operational during those times the facility is
  not staffed.
