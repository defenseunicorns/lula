control-acronym: PE-14
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Maintains temperature and humidity levels within the facility where the
  information system resides at [Assignment: organization - defined acceptable
  levels]; and

  b. Monitors temperature and humidity levels [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies primarily to facilities containing concentrations of
  information system resources, for example, data centers, server rooms, and
  mainframe computer rooms. Related control: AT-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing temperature and humidity control; security plan;
  temperature and humidity controls; facility housing the information system;
  temperature and humidity controls documentation; temperature and humidity
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  information system environmental controls; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  maintenance and monitoring of temperature and humidity levels].

  humidity levels to be maintained within the facility where the information
  system resides."
implementation-guidance: "DoD has defined the acceptable levels as for
  commercial grade information systems: 64.4 â 80.6 degrees F; 45% â 60%
  Relative Humidity; Dew Point 41.9 Â° â 59Â°F; measured at the air intake
  inlet of the IT equipment casing; for other systems, levels within
  manufacturer specifications.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically Compliant"
assessment-procedures: "The organization being inspected/assessed is
  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the acceptable levels as for commercial grade
  information systems: 64.4 â 80.6 degrees F; 45% â 60% Relative Humidity;
  Dew Point 41.9 Â° â 59Â°F; measured at the air intake inlet of the IT
