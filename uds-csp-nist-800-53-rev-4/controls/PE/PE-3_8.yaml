control-acronym: PE-3
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Enforces physical access authorizations at [Assignment:
  organization-defined entry/exit points to the facility where the information
  system resides] by;

  1. Verifying individual access authorizations before granting access to the
  facility; and

  2. Controlling ingress/egress to the facility using [Selection (one or more):
  [Assignment: organization-defined physical access control systems/devices];
  guards];

  b. Maintains physical access audit logs for [Assignment: organization-defined
  entry/exit points];

  c. Provides [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to control
  access to areas within the facility officially designated as publicly
  accessible;

  d. Escorts visitors and monitors visitor activity [Assignment:
  organization-defined circumstances requiring visitor escorts and monitoring];

  e. Secures keys, combinations, and other physical access devices;

  f. Inventories [Assignment: organization-defined physical access devices]
  every [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and

  g. Changes combinations and keys [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]
  and/or when keys are lost, combinations are compromised, or individuals are
  transferred or terminated.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies to organizational employees and visitors. Individuals
  (e.g., employees, contractors, and others) with permanent physical access
  authorization credentials are not considered visitors. Organizations determine
  the types of facility guards needed including, for example, professional
  physical security staff or other personnel such as administrative staff or
  information system users. Physical access devices include, for example, keys,
  locks, combinations, and card readers. Safeguards for publicly accessible
  areas within organizational facilities include, for example, cameras,
  monitoring by guards, and isolating selected information systems and/or system
  components in secured areas. Physical access control systems comply with
  applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations,
  standards, and guidance. The Federal Identity, Credential, and Access
  Management Program provides implementation guidance for identity, credential,
  and access management capabilities for physical access control systems.
  Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs
  can be procedural (e.g., a written log of individuals accessing the facility
  and when such access occurred), automated (e.g., capturing ID provided by a
  PIV card), or some combination thereof. Physical access points can include
  facility access points, interior access points to information systems and/or
  components requiring supplemental access controls, or both. Components of
  organizational information systems (e.g., workstations, terminals) may be
  located in areas designated as publicly accessible with organizations
  safeguarding access to such devices. Related controls: AU-2, AU-6, MP-2, MP-4,
  PE-2, PE-4, PE-5, PS-3, RA-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing physical access control; security plan; physical access
  control logs or records; inventory records of physical access control devices;
  information system entry and exit points; records of key and lock combination
  changes; storage locations for physical access control devices; physical
  access control devices; list of security safeguards controlling access to
  designated publicly accessible areas within facility; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with physical access control
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for physical access control;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing physical access control;
  physical access control devices].

  safeguards to control access to areas within the facility officially
  designated as publicly accessible."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed provides security safeguards defined
  in PE-3, CCI 2920 to control access to areas within the facility officially
  designated as publicly accessible. The organization must document which areas
  are officially designated as publicly accessible.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Facility access control policy and procedures.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documentation of areas officially designated as
  publicly accessible to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  provides security safeguards defined in PE-3, CCI 2920 to control access to
  areas within the facility officially designated as publicly accessible.
