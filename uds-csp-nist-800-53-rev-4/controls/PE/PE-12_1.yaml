control-acronym: PE-12
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs and maintains automatic emergency lighting for the
  information system that activates in the event of a power outage or disruption
  and that covers emergency exits and evacuation routes within the facility.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies primarily to facilities containing concentrations of
  information system resources including, for example, data centers, server
  rooms, and mainframe computer rooms. Related controls: CP-2, CP-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing emergency lighting; emergency lighting documentation;
  emergency lighting test records; emergency exits and evacuation routes; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  emergency lighting and/or planning; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  emergency lighting capability].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed must install and maintain automatic
  emergency lighting for the information system that activates in the event of a
  power outage or disruption and covers emergency exits and evacuation routes
  within the facility in compliance with established OSHA requirements.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Evidence of automatic emergency lighting
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  conducts visual inspections and interviews physical security personnel to
  validate the organization is in compliance with established OSHA requirements
  by employing and maintaining emergency lighting for the information system,
  the emergency lighting activates in the event of a power outage or disruption,
  and it covers emergency exits and evacuation routes within the facility
