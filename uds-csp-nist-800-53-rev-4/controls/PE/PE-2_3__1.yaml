control-acronym: PE-2(3)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization restricts unescorted access to the facility where the
  information system resides to personnel with [Selection (one or more):
  security clearances for all information contained within the system; formal
  access authorizations for all information contained within the system; need
  for access to all information contained within the system; [Assignment:
  organization-defined credentials]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Due to the highly sensitive nature of classified information stored within
  certain facilities, it is important that individuals lacking sufficient
  security clearances, access approvals, or need to know, be escorted by
  individuals with appropriate credentials to ensure that such information is
  not exposed or otherwise compromised. Related controls: PS-2, PS-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing physical access authorizations; authorized personnel
  access list; security clearances; access authorizations; access credentials;
  physical access control logs or records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with physical access
  authorization responsibilities; organizational personnel with physical access
  to information system facility; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for physical access
  authorizations; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing physical
  access authorizations].

cci-definition: "002913: The organization restricts unescorted access to the
  facility where the information system resides to personnel with one or more of
  the following: security clearances for all information contained within the
  system; formal access authorizations for all information contained within the
  system; need for access to all information contained within the system;
  organization-defined credentials."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the
  requirements that must be met before unescorted access to the facility where
  the information system resides will be granted. These requirements will be
  selected from: security clearances for all information contained within the
  system; formal access authorizations for all information contained within the
  system; need for access to all information contained within the system;
  credentials defined in PE-2 (3), CCI 2914. This requirement must be documented
  within the organization's physical security policy.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) PSP document which defines requirements needed for access, per CCI 2914
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the physical security policy to ensure the organization
  being inspected/assessed has selected one or more of the physical security
  requirements that must be met before unescorted access to the facility where
  the information system resides is granted

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Physical access controls,
  monitoring, device protection, etc., must be managed in the data center, cloud
  facility, or on-premise environment and are not functions of UDS. UDS assumes
  the physical environment is secured per organizational policy.)
