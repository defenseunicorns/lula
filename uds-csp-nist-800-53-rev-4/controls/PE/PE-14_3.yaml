control-acronym: PE-14
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Maintains temperature and humidity levels within the facility where the
  information system resides at [Assignment: organization - defined acceptable
  levels]; and

  b. Monitors temperature and humidity levels [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies primarily to facilities containing concentrations of
  information system resources, for example, data centers, server rooms, and
  mainframe computer rooms. Related control: AT-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing temperature and humidity control; security plan;
  temperature and humidity controls; facility housing the information system;
  temperature and humidity controls documentation; temperature and humidity
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  information system environmental controls; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  maintenance and monitoring of temperature and humidity levels].

cci-definition: "000973: The organization monitors temperature and humidity
  levels in accordance with organization-defined frequency."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will maintain an independent monitor
  device for temperature and humidity levels not located in the immediate
  vicinity of the controller continuously unless manufacturer specifications
  allow for a wide enough tolerance that control is not required. Records of
  monitoring must be maintained as an audit trail within the authorization
  lifecycle. DoD has defined the frequency as continuously unless manufacturer
  specifications allow for a wide enough tolerance that control is not required.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Audit logs for temperature and humidity
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  will visually observe the inspected organization's independent monitoring
  device, obtain and examine audit logs, and interview physical security/safety
  personnel to validate the inspected organization monitors temperature and
  humidity levels continuously unless manufacturer specifications allow for a
  wide enough tolerance that control is not required. DoD has defined the
  frequency as continuously unless manufacturer specifications allow for a wide
  enough tolerance that control is not required.
