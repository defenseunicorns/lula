  Description:

  The organization provides a short-term uninterruptible power supply to
  facilitate [Selection (one or more): an orderly shutdown of the information
  system; transition of the information system to long-term alternate power] in
  the event of a primary power source loss.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related controls: AT-3, CP-2, CP-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing emergency power; uninterruptible power supply;
  uninterruptible power supply documentation; uninterruptible power supply test
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  emergency power and/or planning; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  uninterruptible power supply; the uninterruptable power supply].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP
  Moderate Baseline, Rev 4

  power supply to facilitate an orderly shutdown of the information system
  and/or transition of the information system to long-term alternate power in
  the event of a primary power source loss."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed implements an uninterruptible power
  supply with sufficient capacity to support orderly shutdown of the system or
  transition the system to long-term alternate power in the event of a primary
  power source loss.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation identifying the capacity of the implemented uninterruptible
  power supply

  2.) Documentation identifying the power requirements of the system

  3.) Documentation identifying the contingency plan in the event of primary
  power source loss
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines documentation identifying the capacity of the implemented
  uninterruptible power supply, documentation identifying the power requirements
  of the system, and documentation identifying the contingency plan in the event
  of primary power source loss to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed provides uninterruptible power supply with sufficient
  capacity to support orderly shutdown of the system or transition the system to
  long-term alternate power in the event of a primary power source loss.
