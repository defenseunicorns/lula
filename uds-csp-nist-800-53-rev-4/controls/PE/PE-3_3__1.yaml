control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs guards and/or alarms to monitor every physical access
  point to the facility where the information system resides 24 hours per day, 7
  days per week.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related controls: CP-6, CP-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing physical access control; physical access control logs or
  records; physical access control devices; facility surveillance records;
  facility layout documentation; information system entry and exit points; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with physical access control
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for physical access control to
  the facility where the information system resides; automated mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing physical access control for the facility where
  the information system resides].

cci-definition: "000930: The organization employs guards and/or alarms to
  monitor every physical access point to the facility where the information
  system resides 24 hours per day, 7 days per week."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed employs guards and/or alarms to
  monitor every physical access point to the facility where the information
  system resides 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. The organization must create
  and maintain a list of guards or alarms for every physical access point to the
  facility where the information system resides 24 hours per day, 7 days per
  week.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation of the list of guards that have physical access to the
  facility and/or noted alarm equipment in use
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains the list of guards or alarms for every physical access point to the
  facility where the information system resides and visually verifies a sampling
  of access points to ensure the appropriate guard or alarm to monitor is in
  place 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Physical access controls,
  monitoring, device protection, etc., must be managed in the data center, cloud
  facility, or on-premise environment and are not functions of UDS. UDS assumes
  the physical environment is secured per organizational policy.)
