control-acronym: PE-17
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Employs [Assignment: organization-defined security controls] at alternate
  work sites;

  b. Assesses as feasible, the effectiveness of security controls at alternate
  work sites; and

  c. Provides a means for employees to communicate with information security
  personnel in case of security incidents or problems.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Alternate work sites may include, for example, government facilities or
  private residences of employees. While commonly distinct from alternative
  processing sites, alternate work sites may provide readily available alternate
  locations as part of contingency operations. Organizations may define
  different sets of security controls for specific alternate work sites or types
  of sites depending on the work-related activities conducted at those sites.
  This control supports the contingency planning activities of organizations and
  the federal telework initiative. Related controls: AC-17, CP-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy;
  procedures addressing alternate work sites for organizational personnel;
  security plan; list of security controls required for alternate work sites;
  assessments of security controls at alternate work sites; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel approving use of alternate
  work sites; organizational personnel using alternate work sites;
  organizational personnel assessing controls at alternate work sites;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for security at alternate work
  sites; automated mechanisms supporting alternate work sites; security controls
  employed at alternate work sites; means of communications between personnel at
  alternate work sites and security personnel].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP
  Moderate Baseline, Rev 4

  The organization being inspected/assessed must disseminate current contact
  information for appropriate security personnel to all employees; for example,
  telephone or e-mail.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Contact list for appropriate security personnel
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines contact information for appropriate security personnel to
  ensure its accuracy and dissemination.
