  Description:

  The organization provides an incident response support resource, integral to
  the organizational incident response capability that offers advice and
  assistance to users of the information system for the handling and reporting
  of security incidents.

  example, help desks, assistance groups, and access to forensics services, when
  required. Related controls: AT-2, IR-4, IR-6, IR-8, SA-9.


  Added by [r4] Privacy (Confidentiality Impact Level: Moderate) Overlay:
  Incident response assistance for incidents involving PII may include use of
  the forensic, technical, policy, and legal expertise of the organization's
  Information Assurance Officers/Managers, Privacy Officers, Legal Counsel,
  external or internal IT help desks, and the organization's Computer Emergency
  Response Team (CERT), in investigating and remediating incidents. Related
  Control: SE-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident response assistance; incident response plan; security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident response
  assistance and support responsibilities; organizational personnel with access
  to incident response support and assistance capability; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for incident response assistance;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing incident response
  assistance].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] Privacy (Confidentiality Impact Level: Moderate) Overlay:
  Security incident response resources and privacy incident and breach response
  resources must know which resources are available, and how and when to
  coordinate.

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will establish an incident response
  support service, analogous to an IT help desk, to provide advice and
  assistance to users for handling and reporting of security incidents.
  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Incident response support resource
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  will interview organizational users to determine awareness of incident
  response support services and quality of assistance of those services when
  used. If interviewing organizational users is not feasible, then review users
  manuals/documentation to ensures it identifies an incident response support
  service to contact.
