control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Develops an incident response plan that:

  1. Provides the organization with a roadmap for implementing its incident
  response capability;

  2. Describes the structure and organization of the incident response
  capability;

  3. Provides a high-level approach for how the incident response capability
  fits into the overall organization;

  4. Meets the unique requirements of the organization, which relate to mission,
  size, structure, and functions;

  5. Defines reportable incidents;

  6. Provides metrics for measuring the incident response capability within the
  organization;

  7. Defines the resources and management support needed to effectively maintain
  and mature an incident response capability; and

  8. Is reviewed and approved by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
  roles];

  b. Distributes copies of the incident response plan to [Assignment:
  organization-defined incident response personnel (identified by name and/or by
  role) and organizational elements];

  c. Reviews the incident response plan [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency];

  d. Updates the incident response plan to address system/organizational changes
  or problems encountered during plan implementation, execution, or testing;

  e. Communicates incident response plan changes to [Assignment:
  organization-defined incident response personnel (identified by name and/or by
  role) and organizational elements]; and

  f. Protects the incident response plan from unauthorized disclosure and
  modification.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  It is important that organizations develop and implement a coordinated
  approach to incident response. Organizational missions, business functions,
  strategies, goals, and objectives for incident response help to determine the
  structure of incident response capabilities. As part of a comprehensive
  incident response capability, organizations consider the coordination and
  sharing of information with external organizations, including, for example,
  external service providers and organizations involved in the supply chain for
  organizational information systems. Related controls: MP-2, MP-4, MP-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident response planning; incident response plan; records of incident
  response plan reviews and approvals; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident response
  planning responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational incident response plan and related
  organizational processes].
