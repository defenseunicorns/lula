control-acronym: IR-4
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization

  a. Implements an incident handling capability for security incidents that
  includes preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, and
  recovery;

  b. Coordinates incident handling activities with contingency planning
  activities; and

  c. Incorporates lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities into
  incident response procedures, training, and testing/exercises, and implements
  the resulting changes accordingly.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations recognize that incident response capability is dependent on the
  capabilities of organizational information systems and the mission/business
  processes being supported by those systems. Therefore, organizations consider
  incident response as part of the definition, design, and development of
  mission/business processes and information systems. Incident-related
  information can be obtained from a variety of sources including, for example,
  audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring,
  user/administrator reports, and reported supply chain events. Effective
  incident handling capability includes coordination among many organizational
  entities including, for example, mission/business owners, information system
  owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices, physical and personnel
  security offices, legal departments, operations personnel, procurement
  offices, and the risk executive (function). Related controls: AU-6, CM-6,
  CP-2, CP-4, IR-2, IR-3, IR-8, PE-6, SC-5, SC-7, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; contingency planning policy;
  procedures addressing incident handling; incident response plan; contingency
  plan; security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident handling
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with contingency planning
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Incident handling capability for the organization].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] Privacy (Confidentiality Impact Level: Moderate) Overlay: A
  strategic, well-thought-out security incident response program will integrate
  with privacy incident and breach response where appropriate, with the two
  processes being mutually supportive.

cci-definition: "000824: The organization incorporates lessons learned from
  ongoing incident handling activities into incident response procedures,
  training, and testing/exercises."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will conduct after action reviews
  from incidents to identify lessons learned and will incorporate them into
  procedures, training, and testing/exercises. The organization must maintain
  records of after action reviews.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) After action reports
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines after action reports or meeting minutes to identify
  actionable lessons learned to verify that lessons learned are incorporated
  into the plan as changes are necessary.
inherited: Local

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Lessons learned from an
  ongoing IR activity must be managed at the organizational level.)
