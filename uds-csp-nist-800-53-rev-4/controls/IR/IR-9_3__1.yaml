control-acronym: IR-9(3)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined procedures] to
  ensure that organizational personnel impacted by information spills can
  continue to carry out assigned tasks while contaminated systems are undergoing
  corrective actions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Correction actions for information systems contaminated due to information
  spillages may be very time-consuming. During those periods, personnel may not
  have access to the contaminated systems, which may potentially affect their
  ability to conduct organizational business.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident handling; procedures addressing information spillage; incident
  response plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident response
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for post-spill operations].

  systems are undergoing corrective actions.

  2.) Incident response after action report
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented procedures defined in IR-9 (3), CCI 2819
  as well as after action reports of incidents to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed implements procedures defined in IR-9 (3), CCI 2819 to
  ensure that organizational personnel impacted by information spills can
  continue to carry out assigned tasks while contaminated systems are undergoing
  corrective actions.
