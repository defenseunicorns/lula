control-acronym: IR-5
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization tracks and documents information system security incidents.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Documenting information system security incidents includes, for example,
  maintaining records about each incident, the status of the incident, and other
  pertinent information necessary for forensics, evaluating incident details,
  trends, and handling. Incident information can be obtained from a variety of
  sources including, for example, incident reports, incident response teams,
  audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, and
  user/administrator reports. Related controls: AU-6, IR-8, PE-6, SC-5, SC-7,
  SI-3, SI-4, SI-7.

  Related Control: SE-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident monitoring; incident response records and documentation; incident
  response plan; security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident monitoring
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Incident monitoring capability for the organization;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing tracking and documenting
  of system security incidents].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] Privacy (Confidentiality Impact Level: Moderate) Overlay:
  Tracking and documenting security and privacy incidents enables the
  organization to respond more effectively and evaluate both individual
  incidents and trends across incidents over time.

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will document within their incident
  handling plan, procedures to leverage the Joint Incident Management System
  (JIMS). For the DoD, JIMS is the automated mechanism. Recommended Compelling
  Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Incident Handling Plan, referencing information system
  security incidents section
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the incident handling plan to ensure that there are
  procedures identified to leverage the JIMS.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (This must be managed by
  the organization through their reporting channels though UDS does support
  integration with SIEM tools.)
