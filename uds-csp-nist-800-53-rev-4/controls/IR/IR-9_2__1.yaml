  Description:

  The organization provides information spillage response training [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  information spillage response training; information spillage response training
  curriculum; information spillage response training materials; incident
  response plan; information spillage response training records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident response
  training responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].

cci-definition: "002816: The organization provides information spillage response
  training according to an organization-defined frequency."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to provide information spillage response training annually. The organization
  must maintain a record of training. DoD has defined the frequency as annually.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation of a process to provide information spillage response
  training annually

  2.) Record of training
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process as well as the training records
  for a sampling of incident response personnel to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed provides information spillage response training annually.
  DoD has defined the frequency as annually.
