control-acronym: IR-4(8)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization coordinates with [Assignment: organization-defined external
  organizations] to correlate and share [Assignment: organization-defined
  incident information] to achieve a cross-organization perspective on incident
  awareness and more effective incident responses.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The coordination of incident information with external organizations
  including, for example, mission/business partners, military/coalition
  partners, customers, and multitiered developers, can provide significant
  benefits. Cross-organizational coordination with respect to incident handling
  can serve as an important risk management capability. This capability allows
  organizations to leverage critical information from a variety of sources to
  effectively respond to information security-related incidents potentially
  affecting the organization's operations, assets, and individuals.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  incident handling; list of external organizations; records of incident
  handling coordination with external organizations; incident response plan;
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident handling
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; personnel from external organizations with whom incident
  response information is to be coordinated/shared/correlated].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for coordinating incident
  handling information with external organizations].

  correlate and share with organization-defined external organizations."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents what incident
  information will be correlated and shared with each external organization
  defined in IR-4 (8), CCI 2786.

  DoD has determined the incident information is not appropriate to define at
  the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation that defines what information will be correlated and shared
  with each external organization defined in IR-4 (8), CCI 2786.
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented incident information to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed defines what incident information will be correlated and
  shared with each external organization defined in IR-4 (8), CCI 2786.


  DoD has determined the incident information is not appropriate to define at
  the Enterprise level.
