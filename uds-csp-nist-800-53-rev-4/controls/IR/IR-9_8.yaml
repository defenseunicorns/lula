control-acronym: IR-9
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization responds to information spills by:

  a. Identifying the specific information involved in the information system
  contamination;

  b. Alerting [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] of the
  information spill using a method of communication not associated with the
  spill;

  c. Isolating the contaminated information system or system component;

  d. Eradicating the information from the contaminated information system or
  component;

  e. Identifying other information systems or system components that may have
  been subsequently contaminated; and

  f. Performing other [Assignment: organization-defined actions].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information spillage refers to instances where either classified or sensitive
  information is inadvertently placed on information systems that are not
  authorized to process such information. Such information spills often occur
  when information that is initially thought to be of lower sensitivity is
  transmitted to an information system and then is subsequently determined to be
  of higher sensitivity. At that point, corrective action is required. The
  nature of the organizational response is generally based upon the degree of
  sensitivity of the spilled information (e.g., security category or
  classification level), the security capabilities of the information system,
  the specific nature of contaminated storage media, and the access
  authorizations (e.g., security clearances) of individuals with authorized
  access to the contaminated system. The methods used to communicate information
  about the spill after the fact do not involve methods directly associated with
  the actual spill to minimize the risk of further spreading the contamination
  before such contamination is isolated and eradicated.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Incident response policy; procedures addressing
  information spillage; incident response plan; records of information spillage
  alerts/notifications, list of personnel who should receive alerts of
  information spillage; list of actions to be performed regarding information
  spillage; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with incident response
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for information spillage
  response; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing information
  spillage response actions and related communications].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed

  defines and documents additional actions to be taken in response to spillage
  incidents. The actions must include the following: 

  1)consider the information system as classified at the same level as the
  spilled information until the appropriate remediation processes have been
  executed and verified;

  2) Include the investigative team members and questions identified in CNSS
  Instruction 1001 in investigation of the incident; 

  3) Protect information regarding the incident from disclosure.


  DoD has determined the actions are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise
  level.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation that defines additional actions to be taken in response to
  spillage incidents.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented additional actions to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed defines other actions required to
  respond to information spills. DoD has determined the actions are not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level
