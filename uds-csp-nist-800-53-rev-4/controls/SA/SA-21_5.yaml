control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization requires that the developer of [Assignment:
  organization-defined information system, system component, or information
  system service]:

  a. Have appropriate access authorizations as determined by assigned
  [Assignment: organization-defined official government duties]; and

  b. Satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined additional personnel screening
  criteria].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Because the information system, system component, or information system
  service may be employed in critical activities essential to the national
  and/or economic security interests of the United States, organizations have a
  strong interest in ensuring that the developer is trustworthy. The degree of
  trust required of the developer may need to be consistent with that of the
  individuals accessing the information system/component/service once deployed.
  Examples of authorization and personnel screening criteria include clearance,
  satisfactory background checks, citizenship, and nationality. Trustworthiness
  of developers may also include a review and analysis of company ownership and
  any relationships the company has with entities potentially affecting the
  quality/reliability of the systems, components, or services being developed.
  Related controls: PS-3, PS-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; personnel
  security policy and procedures; procedures addressing personnel screening;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; list of appropriate access
  authorizations required by developers of the information system; personnel
  screening criteria and associated documentation; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and services
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibility for
  developer screening].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for developer screening;
  automated mechanisms supporting developer screening].

  The organization being inspected/assessed requires within contracts that the
  developer of information system, system component, or information system
  service defined in SA-21, CCI 3384 satisfy additional personnel screening
  criteria defined in SA-21, CCI 3381.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP).

  2.) System development life cycle (SDLC) documentation.

  3.) Continuous monitoring plan that requires the developers of
  organization-defined information system, system component, or information
  system service satisfy organization-defined additional personnel screening
  criteria.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the contracts/agreements to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed requires that the developer of information system, system
  component, or information system service defined in SA-21, CCI 3384 satisfy
  additional personnel screening criteria defined in SA-21, CCI 3381.
