control-acronym: SA-22
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Replaces information system components when support for the components is
  no longer available from the developer, vendor, or manufacturer; and

  b. Provides justification and documents approval for the continued use of
  unsupported system components required to satisfy mission/business needs.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Support for information system components includes, for example, software
  patches, firmware updates, replacement parts, and maintenance contracts.
  Unsupported components (e.g., when vendors are no longer providing critical
  software patches), provide a substantial opportunity for adversaries to
  exploit new weaknesses discovered in the currently installed components.
  Exceptions to replacing unsupported system components may include, for
  example, systems that provide critical mission/business capability where newer
  technologies are not available or where the systems are so isolated that
  installing replacement components is not an option. Related controls: PL-2,
  SA-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing replacement or continued use of unsupported information system
  components; documented evidence of replacing unsupported information system
  components; documented approvals (including justification) for continued use
  of unsupported information system components; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and services
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibility system
  development life cycle; organizational personnel responsible for configuration
  management].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for replacing unsupported system
  components; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing replacement of
  unsupported system components].

cci-definition: "003376: The organization replaces information system components
  when support for the components is no longer available from the developer,
  vendor, or manufacturer."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to replace information system components when support for the components is no
  longer available from the developer, vendor, or manufacturer.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP).

  2.) System development life cycle (SDLC) documentation.

  3.) Continuous monitoring plan for replacing information system components
  when support for the components is no longer available from the developer,
  vendor, or manufacturer.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process as well as the hardware and
  software lists to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed replaces
  information system components when support for the components is no longer
  available from the developer, vendor, or manufacturer.

compliance-status: Compliant
test-results: UDS maintainers and the operations team actively manage components
  to avoid using outdated or unsupported software. UDS is based on modern
  open-source projects with active support. If a component nears end-of-life,
  the UDS project will incorporate a supported alternative or newer version in
  its package. Because everything is containerized, updating a component to a
  supported version is straightforward by deploying a new container image.
  Defense Unicorns provides regularly updated container images known as Unicorn
  Images which are regularly scanned and hardened as a service to the
  organization.
