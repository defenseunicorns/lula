control-acronym: SA-15
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Requires the developer of the information system, system component, or
  information system service to follow a documented development process that:

  1. Explicitly addresses security requirements;

  2. Identifies the standards and tools used in the development process;

  3. Documents the specific tool options and tool configurations used in the
  development process; and

  4. Documents, manages, and ensures the integrity of changes to the process
  and/or tools used in development; and

  b. Reviews the development process, standards, tools, and tool
  options/configurations [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to
  determine if the process, standards, tools, and tool options/configurations
  selected and employed can satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined security
  requirements].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Development tools include, for example, programming languages and
  computer-aided design (CAD) systems. Reviews of development processes can
  include, for example, the use of maturity models to determine the potential
  effectiveness of such processes. Maintaining the integrity of changes to tools
  and processes enables accurate supply chain risk assessment and mitigation,
  and requires robust configuration control throughout the life cycle (including
  design, development, transport, delivery, integration, and maintenance) to
  track authorized changes and prevent unauthorized changes. Related controls:
  SA-3, SA-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing development process, standards, and tools; procedures addressing
  the integration of security requirements during the development process;
  solicitation documentation; acquisition documentation; service-level
  agreements; acquisition contracts for the information system, system
  component, or information system service; system developer documentation
  listing tool options/configuration guides, configuration management records;
  change control records; configuration control records; documented reviews of
  development process, standards, tools, and tool options/configurations; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and services
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system developer].

cci-definition: "003243: The organization reviews the development tools in
  accordance with organization-defined frequency to determine if the development
  tools selected and employed can satisfy organization-defined security
  requirements."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to review the development tools before first use and annually thereafter to
  determine if the development tools selected and employed can satisfy the
  security requirements defined in SA-15, CCI 3246. The organization must
  maintain a record of reviews. DoD has defined the frequency as before first
  use and annually thereafter.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP).

  2.) System development life cycle (SDLC) documentation.

  3.) Continuous monitoring plan for reviewing the organization-defined
  frequency to ensure the development process selected and employed can satisfy
  organization-defined security requirements.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process as well as the record of reviews
  to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed reviews the development
  tools before first use and annually thereafter to determine if the development
  tools selected and employed can satisfy the security requirements defined in
  SA-15, CCI 3246. DoD has defined the frequency as before first use and
  annually thereafter.

  secure development practices of UDS, but they don't enforce them. If the
  organization builds anything on top of UDS, they should apply their own secure
  SDLC standards.)
