control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization requires the developer of the information system, system
  component, or information system service to provide a description of the
  functional properties of the security controls to be employed.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Functional properties of security controls describe the functionality (i.e.,
  security capability, functions, or mechanisms) visible at the interfaces of
  the controls and specifically exclude functionality and data structures
  internal to the operation of the controls. Related control: SA-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing the integration of information security requirements, descriptions,
  and criteria into the acquisition process; solicitation documents; acquisition
  documentation; acquisition contracts for the information system, system
  component, or information system services; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with acquisition/contracting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibility for determining
  information system security functional requirements; information system
  developer or service provider; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for determining information
  system security functional, requirements; organizational processes for
  developing acquisition contracts; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing acquisitions and inclusion of security requirements in
  contracts].
