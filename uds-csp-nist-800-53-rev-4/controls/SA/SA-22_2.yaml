control-acronym: SA-22
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Replaces information system components when support for the components is
  no longer available from the developer, vendor, or manufacturer; and

  b. Provides justification and documents approval for the continued use of
  unsupported system components required to satisfy mission/business needs.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Support for information system components includes, for example, software
  patches, firmware updates, replacement parts, and maintenance contracts.
  Unsupported components (e.g., when vendors are no longer providing critical
  software patches), provide a substantial opportunity for adversaries to
  exploit new weaknesses discovered in the currently installed components.
  Exceptions to replacing unsupported system components may include, for
  example, systems that provide critical mission/business capability where newer
  technologies are not available or where the systems are so isolated that
  installing replacement components is not an option. Related controls: PL-2,
  SA-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing replacement or continued use of unsupported information system
  components; documented evidence of replacing unsupported information system
  components; documented approvals (including justification) for continued use
  of unsupported information system components; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and services
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibility system
  development life cycle; organizational personnel responsible for configuration
  management].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for replacing unsupported system
  components; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing replacement of
  unsupported system components].

cci-definition: "003374: The organization documents approval for the continued
  use of unsupported system components required to satisfy mission/business
  needs."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents approval for the continued
  use of unsupported system components required to satisfy mission/business
  needs.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP).

  2.) System development life cycle (SDLC) documentation.

  3.) Continuous monitoring plan for documenting approval for the continued use
  of unsupported system components required to satisfy mission/business needs.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the hardware and software lists as well as the documented
  approvals to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed documents
  approval for the continued use of unsupported system components required to
  satisfy mission/business needs.
