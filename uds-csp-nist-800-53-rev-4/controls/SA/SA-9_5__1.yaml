control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization restricts the location of [Selection (one or more):
  information processing; information/data; information system services] to
  [Assignment: organization-defined locations] based on [Assignment:
  organization-defined requirements or conditions].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The location of information processing, information/data storage, or
  information system services that are critical to organizations can have a
  direct impact on the ability of those organizations to successfully execute
  their missions/business functions. This situation exists when external
  providers control the location of processing, storage or services. The
  criteria external providers use for the selection of processing, storage, or
  service locations may be different from organizational criteria. For example,
  organizations may want to ensure that data/information storage locations are
  restricted to certain locations to facilitate incident response activities
  (e.g., forensic analyses, after-the-fact investigations) in case of
  information security breaches/compromises. Such incident response activities
  may be adversely affected by the governing laws or protocols in the locations
  where processing and storage occur and/or the locations from which information
  system services emanate.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing external information system services; acquisition contracts for the
  information system, system component, or information system service;
  solicitation documentation; acquisition documentation; service-level
  agreements; restricted locations for information processing; information/data
  and/or information system services; information processing, information/data,
  and/or information system services to be maintained in restricted locations;
  organizational security requirements or conditions for external providers;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and services
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; external providers of information system services].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for defining requirements to
  restrict locations of information processing, information/data, or information
  services; organizational processes for ensuring the location is restricted in
  accordance with requirements or conditions].

cci-definition: "003152: The organization restricts the location of information
  processing, information/data, and/or information system services to
  organization-defined locations based on organization-defined requirements or
  conditions."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed restricts the location of
  information processing, information/data, and/or information system services
  to locations defined in SA-9 (5), CCI 3153 based on requirements or conditions
  defined in SA-9 (5), CCI 3154.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP) will define the locations of information
  processing, information/data, and/or information system services to
  organization-defined locations based on organization-defined requirements or
  conditions.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines a list of locations of information processing,
  information/data, and/or information system services to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed restricts the location of information
  processing, information/data, and/or information system services to locations
  defined in SA-9 (5), CCI 3153 based on requirements or conditions defined in
  SA-9 (5), CCI 3154.
