control-acronym: SA-16
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization requires the developer of the information system, system
  component, or information system service to provide [Assignment:
  organization-defined training] on the correct use and operation of the
  implemented security functions, controls, and/or mechanisms.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies to external and internal (in-house) developers. Training
  of personnel is an essential element to ensure the effectiveness of security
  controls implemented within organizational information systems. Training
  options include, for example, classroom-style training,
  web-based/computer-based training, and hands-on training. Organizations can
  also request sufficient training materials from developers to conduct in-house
  training or offer self-training to organizational personnel. Organizations
  determine the type of training necessary and may require different types of
  training for different security functions, controls, or mechanisms. Related
  controls: AT-2, AT-3, SA-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing developer-provided training; solicitation documentation;
  acquisition documentation; service-level agreements; acquisition contracts for
  the information system, system component, or information system service;
  developer-provided training materials; training records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and services
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information system
  security responsibilities; system developer; organizational or third-party
  developers with training responsibilities for the information system, system
  component, or information system service].

  system component, or information system service is required to provide on the
  correct use and operation of the implemented security functions, controls,
  and/or mechanisms."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the training
  the developer of the information system, system component, or information
  system service is required to provide on the correct use and operation of the
  implemented security functions, controls, and/or mechanisms. DoD has
  determined the training is not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP).

  2.) System development life cycle (SDLC) documentation.

  3.) Continuous monitoring plan that defines the training developers of the
  information system, system component or information system service are
  required to provide on the use and operation of the implemented security
  functions, controls and/or mechanisms.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented training to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed defines the training the developer of the information
  system, system component, or information system service is required to provide
  on the correct use and operation of the implemented security functions,
  controls, and/or mechanisms. DoD has determined the training is not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
