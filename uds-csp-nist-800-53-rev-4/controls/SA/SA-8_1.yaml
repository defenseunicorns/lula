control-acronym: SA-8
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization applies information system security engineering principles in
  the specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of
  the information system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations apply security engineering principles primarily to new
  development information systems or systems undergoing major upgrades. For
  legacy systems, organizations apply security engineering principles to system
  upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given the current state of
  hardware, software, and firmware within those systems. Security engineering
  principles include, for example: (i) developing layered protections; (ii)
  establishing sound security policy, architecture, and controls as the
  foundation for design; (iii) incorporating security requirements into the
  system development life cycle; (iv) delineating physical and logical security
  boundaries; (v) ensuring that system developers are trained on how to build
  secure software; (vi) tailoring security controls to meet organizational and
  operational needs; (vii) performing threat modeling to identify use cases,
  threat agents, attack vectors, and attack patterns as well as compensating
  controls and design patterns needed to mitigate risk; and (viii) reducing risk
  to acceptable levels, thus enabling informed risk management decisions.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing security engineering principles used in the specification, design,
  development, implementation, and modification of the information system;
  information system design documentation; information security requirements and
  specifications for the information system; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with acquisition/contracting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibility for determining
  information system security requirements; organizational personnel with
  information system specification, design, development, implementation, and
  modification responsibilities; information system developers; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for applying security engineering
  principles in information system specification, design, development,
  implementation, and modification; automated mechanisms supporting the
  application of security engineering principles in information system
  specification, design, development, implementation, and modification].

  The organization managing the acquisition/development of the information
  system (e.g. PM) applies and documents system security engineering (SSE)
  principles as part of the overall systems engineering process IAW DoDD 5000.01
  and DoDI 5000.02. The primary source of general and DoD-specific guidance on
  SSE can be found in the NIST SP 800-160 - Systems Security Engineering,
  currently in draft form, and can be found here:
  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html. Additional guidance can be
  found in the Defense Acquisition Guidebook (DAG) Chapters 4 and 13, found
  here: https://dag.dau.mil/. This CCI does not apply to COTS products.

  The organization managing the acquisition/development of the information
  system must ensure that the system requirements documents reflect the system
  security engineering principles that can be applied to information systems in
  development, systems undergoing major upgrades and to the extent feasible
  systems in sustainment. Security engineering principles include:

  1. Developing layered protections;

  2. Establishing sound security policy, architecture, and controls as the
  foundation for design;

  3. Incorporating security requirements into all phases of the system
  development life cycle;

  4. Delineating physical and logical security boundaries; 5. Ensuring that
  system developers are trained on how to design and build secure software; 6.
  Tailoring security controls and protections to meet system-specific
  requirements and operational needs;

  7. Performing threat modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack
  vectors, and attack patterns as well as compensating controls and design
  patterns needed to mitigate risk.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP).

  2.) Design documentation must include system requirements documentation and it
  must apply information system security principles in specifications.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the system requirements documents to ensure that the
  organization being inspected/assessed applies information system security
  engineering principles in the specification of the information system.

test-results: "UDS was designed with security engineering principles (like least
  privilege, defense-in-depth, fail-safe defaults) from the ground up. For
  instance, zero trust networking (all internal comms encrypted and
  authenticated) is implemented via Istio, least privilege via RBAC and minimal
  container images, segmentation via NeuVector, and so on. By using UDS, an
  organization is effectively implementing a system that adheres to robust
  security best practices by default. This addresses SA-8, which calls for
  applying security design principles in the implementation of the system.
  Instead of building a system from scratch, the organization adopts UDS which
  already incorporates those principles. Therefore, UDS strongly supports SA-8:
  its architecture is an embodiment of secure design (modularity, layering,
  least privilege, etc.), ensuring the system is resilient and easier to
  protect."
