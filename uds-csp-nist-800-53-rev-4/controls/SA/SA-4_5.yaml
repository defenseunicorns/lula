control-acronym: SA-4
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization includes the following requirements, descriptions, and
  criteria, explicitly or by reference, in the acquisition contract for the
  information system, system component, or information system service in
  accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
  policies, regulations, standards, guidelines, and organizational
  mission/business needs:

  a. Security functional requirements;

  b. Security strength requirements;

  c. Security assurance requirements;

  d. Security-related documentation requirements;

  e. Requirements for protecting security-related documentation;

  f. Description of the information system development environment and
  environment in which the system is intended to operate; and

  g. Acceptance criteria.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information system components are discrete, identifiable information
  technology assets (e.g., hardware, software, or firmware) that represent the
  building blocks of an information system. Information system components
  include commercial information technology products. Security functional
  requirements include security capabilities, security functions, and security
  mechanisms. Security strength requirements associated with such capabilities,
  functions, and mechanisms include degree of correctness, completeness,
  resistance to direct attack, and resistance to tampering or bypass. Security
  assurance requirements include: (i) development processes, procedures,
  practices, and methodologies; and (ii) evidence from development and
  assessment activities providing grounds for confidence that the required
  security functionality has been implemented and the required security strength
  has been achieved. Security documentation requirements address all phases of
  the system development life cycle.
   Security functionality, assurance, and documentation requirements are expressed in terms of security controls and control enhancements that have been selected through the tailoring process. The security control tailoring process includes, for example, the specification of parameter values through the use of assignment and selection statements and the specification of platform dependencies and implementation information. Security documentation provides user and administrator guidance regarding the implementation and operation of security controls. The level of detail required in security documentation is based on the security category or classification level of the information system and the degree to which organizations depend on the stated security capability, functions, or mechanisms to meet overall risk response expectations (as defined in the organizational risk management strategy). Security requirements can also include organizationally mandated configuration settings specifying allowed functions, ports, protocols, and services. Acceptance criteria for information systems, information system components, and information system services are defined in the same manner as such criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 7.103 contains information security requirements from FISMA. Related controls: CM-6, PL-2, PS-7, SA-3, SA-5, SA-8, SA-11, SA-12.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing acquisitions and inclusion of
  security requirements in contracts].

cci-definition: "003098: The organization includes requirements for protecting
  security-related documentation, explicitly or by reference, in the acquisition
  contract for the information system, system component, or information system
  service in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,
  directives, policies, regulations, standards, guidelines, and organizational

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents within
  contracts/agreements for the information system, system component, or
  information system service, requirements for protecting security-related
  documentation, explicitly or by reference.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Acquisition contract includes procedures for protecting security-related
  documentation and documents its compliance with laws and regulations, as well
  as organizational mission/business needs.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the contracts/agreements to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed includes requirements for protecting security-related
  documentation, explicitly or by reference, in the acquisition contract for the
  information system, system component, or information system service in
  accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
  policies, regulations, standards, guidelines, and organizational
  mission/business needs.
