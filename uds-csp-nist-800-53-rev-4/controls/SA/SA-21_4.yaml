control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization requires that the developer of [Assignment:
  organization-defined information system, system component, or information
  system service]:

  a. Have appropriate access authorizations as determined by assigned
  [Assignment: organization-defined official government duties]; and

  b. Satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined additional personnel screening
  criteria].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Because the information system, system component, or information system
  service may be employed in critical activities essential to the national
  and/or economic security interests of the United States, organizations have a
  strong interest in ensuring that the developer is trustworthy. The degree of
  trust required of the developer may need to be consistent with that of the
  individuals accessing the information system/component/service once deployed.
  Examples of authorization and personnel screening criteria include clearance,
  satisfactory background checks, citizenship, and nationality. Trustworthiness
  of developers may also include a review and analysis of company ownership and
  any relationships the company has with entities potentially affecting the
  quality/reliability of the systems, components, or services being developed.
  Related controls: PS-3, PS-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

cci-definition: "003381: The organization defines additional personnel screening
  criteria that must be satisfied by the developer of organization-defined
  information system, system component, or information system service."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents additional
  personnel screening criteria that must be satisfied by the developer of
  organization-defined information system, system component, or information
  system service.

  DoD has determined the additional personnel screening criteria is not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  The organization should ensure that the developer is trustworthy by performing
  a review of the developer that may include:

  1. Organization and process certifications;

  2. Security policies, procedures, and activities across the lifecycle;

  3. Supply chain and how suppliers select/manage their suppliers/service
  providers;

  4. Financials to determine if the supplier is financially stable;

  5. Foreign Ownership, Control, and Influence;

  6. Past performance and vulnerabilities;

  7. Business relationships;

  8. Maturity of business processes; and

  9. Developer screening practices that may include::

  a. Evaluating and vetting key personnel through security reviews (including
  clearance, satisfactory background checks, citizenship, and nationality) by
  acquirers or suppliers in any capacity (full-time employee, part-time
  employee, consultant, contractor, subcontractor, vendor, agent, etc.);

  b. Reevaluating personnel through security reviews and assessments on a
  periodic basis or upon occurrence of specific significant events.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP).

  2.) System development life cycle (SDLC) documentation.

  3.) Continuous monitoring plan for defining additional personnel screening
  criteria that must be satisfied by the developers of organization-defined
  information system, system component, or information system service
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented additional personnel screening criteria to
  ensure the organization being inspected/assessed defines additional personnel
  screening criteria that must be satisfied by the developer of
  organization-defined information system, system component, or information
  system service. DoD has determined the additional personnel screening criteria
  is not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
