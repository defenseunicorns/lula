  Description:

  The organization protects against supply chain threats to the information
  system, system component, or information system service by employing
  [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] as part of a
  comprehensive, defense-in-breadth information security strategy.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information systems (including system components that compose those systems)
  need to be protected throughout the system development life cycle (i.e.,
  during design, development, manufacturing, packaging, assembly, distribution,
  system integration, operations, maintenance, and retirement). Protection of
  organizational information systems is accomplished through threat awareness,
  by the identification, management, and reduction of vulnerabilities at each
  phase of the life cycle and the use of complementary, mutually reinforcing
  strategies to respond to risk. Organizations consider implementing a
  standardized process to address supply chain risk with respect to information
  systems and system components, and to educate the acquisition workforce on
  threats, risk, and required security controls. Organizations use the
  acquisition/procurement processes to require supply chain entities to
  implement necessary security safeguards to: (i) reduce the likelihood of
  unauthorized modifications at each stage in the supply chain; and (ii) protect
  information systems and information system components, prior to taking
  delivery of such systems/components. This control enhancement also applies to
  information system services. Security safeguards include, for example: (i)
  security controls for development systems, development facilities, and
  external connections to development systems; (ii) vetting development
  personnel; and (iii) use of tamper-evident packaging during
  shipping/warehousing. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans,
  evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the security category or
  classification level of the information system. Contracts may specify
  documentation protection requirements. Related controls: AT-3, CM-8, IR-4,
  PE-16, PL-8, SA-3, SA-4, SA-8, SA-10, SA-14, SA-15, SA-18, SA-19, SC-29,
  SC-30, SC-38, SI-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing supply chain protection; procedures addressing the integration of
  information security requirements into the acquisition process; solicitation
  documentation; acquisition documentation; service-level agreements;
  acquisition contracts for the information system, system component, or
  information system service; list of supply chain threats; list of security
  safeguards to be taken against supply chain threats; system development life
  cycle documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and services
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with supply chain
  protection responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for defining safeguards for and
  protecting against supply chain threats; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing safeguards for supply chain threats].
