  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Limits the use of commercially provided information assurance (IA) and
  IA-enabled information technology products to those products that have been
  successfully evaluated against a National Information Assurance partnership
  (NIAP)-approved Protection Profile for a specific technology type, if such a
  profile exists; and

  (b) Requires, if no NIAP-approved Protection Profile exists for a specific
  technology type but a commercially provided information technology product
  relies on cryptographic functionality to enforce its security policy, that the
  cryptographic module is FIPS-validated.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related controls: SC-12, SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing the integration of information security requirements, descriptions,
  and criteria into the acquisition process; solicitation documents; acquisition
  documentation; acquisition contracts for the information system, system
  component, or information system service; NAIP-approved protection profiles;
  FIPS-validation information for cryptographic functionality; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with acquisition/contracting
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibility for determining
  information system security requirements; organizational personnel responsible
  for ensuring information assurance products are have been evaluated against a
  NIAP-approved protection profile or for ensuring products relying on
  cryptographic functionality are FIPS-validated; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for selecting and employing
  products/services evaluated against a NIAP-approved protection profile or
  FIPS-validated products].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed, when using commercially provided IA
  or IA enabled IT products for which there is no NIAP-approved protection
  profile, relies on FIPS-validated cryptographic modules.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP) cryptographic module documentation is
  FIPS-validated.

  2.) Documentation must confirm it is from FIPS 201-approved products list.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the hardware and software lists to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed, when using commercially provided IA or
  IA enabled IT products for which there is no NIAP-approved protection profile,
  relies on FIPS-validated cryptographic modules.

test-results: UDS uses FIPS-validated images where a cryptographic module is
  required. All FIPS-validated software is sourced from Iron Bank or from
  Defense Unicorns. Entropy must be provided as specified in its cryptographic
  policy. For example UDS uses Istio and Keycloak enabled FIPS image (140-2
  encryption) in transit for apps hosted.
