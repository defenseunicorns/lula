control-acronym: SA-9(2)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization requires providers of [Assignment: organization-defined
  external information system services] to identify the functions, ports,
  protocols, and other services required for the use of such services. 


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information from external service providers regarding the specific functions,
  ports, protocols, and services used in the provision of such services can be
  particularly useful when the need arises to understand the trade-offs involved
  in restricting certain functions/services or blocking certain ports/protocols.
  Related control: CM-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing external information system services; acquisition contracts for the
  information system, system component, or information system service;
  acquisition documentation; solicitation documentation, service-level
  agreements; organizational security requirements and security specifications
  for external service providers; list of required functions, ports, protocols,
  and other services; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and services
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; external providers
  of information system services].
