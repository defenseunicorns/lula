  Description:

  The organization requires the developer of the information system, system
  component, or information system service to:

  a. Create and implement a security assessment plan;

  b. Perform [Selection (one or more): unit; integration; system; regression]
  testing/evaluation at [Assignment: organization-defined depth and coverage];

  c. Produce evidence of the execution of the security assessment plan and the
  results of the security testing/evaluation;

  d. Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process; and

  e. Correct flaws identified during security testing/evaluation.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Developmental security testing/evaluation occurs at all post-design phases of
  the system development life cycle. Such testing/evaluation confirms that the
  required security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended,
  enforcing the desired security policy, and meeting established security
  requirements. Security properties of information systems may be affected by
  the interconnection of system components or changes to those components. These
  interconnections or changes (e.g., upgrading or replacing applications and
  operating systems) may adversely affect previously implemented security
  controls. This control provides additional types of security
  testing/evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate
  potential flaws. Testing custom software applications may require approaches
  such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the
  three approaches. Developers can employ these analysis approaches in a variety
  of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary
  analyzers) and in source code reviews. Security assessment plans provide the
  specific activities that developers plan to carry out including the types of
  analyses, testing, evaluation, and reviews of software and firmware
  components, the degree of rigor to be applied, and the types of artifacts
  produced during those processes. The depth of security testing/evaluation
  refers to the rigor and level of detail associated with the assessment process
  (e.g., black box, gray box, or white box testing). The coverage of security
  testing/evaluation refers to the scope (i.e., number and type) of the
  artifacts included in the assessment process. Contracts specify the acceptance
  criteria for security assessment plans, flaw remediation processes, and the
  evidence that the plans/processes have been diligently applied. Methods for
  reviewing and protecting assessment plans, evidence, and documentation are
  commensurate with the security category or classification level of the
  information system. Contracts may specify documentation protection
  requirements. Related controls: CA-2, CM-4, SA-3, SA-4, SA-5, SI-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and services acquisition policy; procedures
  addressing system developer security testing; procedures addressing flaw
  remediation; solicitation documentation; acquisition documentation;
  service-level agreements; acquisition contracts for the information system,
  system component, or information system service; system developer security
  test plans; records of developer security testing results for the information
  system, system component, or information system service; security flaw and
  remediation tracking records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with system and services
  acquisition responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; organizational personnel with developer security
  testing responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for monitoring developer security
  testing and evaluation; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  the monitoring of developer security testing and evaluation].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed requires that the developer create
  and document a security assessment plan that includes:

  1. The types of analyses, testing, evaluation, and reviews of software and
  firmware components;

  2. The degree of rigor to be applied; and

  3. The types of artifacts produced during those processes.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) System security plan (SSP).

  2.) System development life cycle (SDLC) documentation must contain
  developer-created Security Assessment Plan.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the contracts/agreements to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed requires that the developer of the information system,
  system component, or information system service create a security assessment
  plan.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (This pertains to the UDS
  developers performing code reviews, security testing, etc. The UDS product
  comes tested; the user of UDS does not control the internal development
  processes of those components, aside from applying updates when available.
  Several UDS components are widely used open source project; that have their
  own testing regimes (unit tests, integration tests, possibly security audits
  by the community).
