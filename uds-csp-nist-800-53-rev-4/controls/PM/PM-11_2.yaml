control-acronym: PM-11
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Defines mission/business processes with consideration for information
  security and the resulting risk to organizational operations, organizational
  assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation; and

  b. Determines information protection needs arising from the defined
  mission/business processes and revises the processes as necessary, until
  achievable protection needs are obtained.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information protection needs are technology-independent, required capabilities
  to counter threats to organizations, individuals, or the Nation through the
  compromise of information (i.e., loss of confidentiality, integrity, or
  availability). Information protection needs are derived from the
  mission/business needs defined by the organization, the mission/business
  processes selected to meet the stated needs, and the organizational risk
  management strategy. Information protection needs determine the required
  security controls for the organization and the associated information systems
  supporting the mission/business processes. Inherent in defining an
  organization's information protection needs is an understanding of the level
  of adverse impact that could result if a compromise of information occurs. The
  security categorization process is used to make such potential impact
  determinations. Mission/business process definitions and associated
  information protection requirements are documented by the organization in
  accordance with organizational policy and procedure. Related controls: PM-7,
  PM-8, RA-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; risk management
  strategy; procedures for determining mission/business protection needs; risk
  assessment results relevant to determination of mission/business protection
  needs; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  program planning and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational
  personnel responsible for mission/business processes; organizational personnel
  responsible for determining information protection needs for mission/business
  processes; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for defining mission/business
  processes and their information protection needs].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed determines information protection
  needs IAW CNSSI 1253 and as identified in RA-2.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated security plan that includes information protection needs
  derived from mission/businesses processes.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the security plan to ensure the security categorization
  has been documented IAW CNSSI 1253.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The Program Management
  (PM) family of controls primarily focuses on high-level organizational
  security governance, including policies, risk management strategies, and
  enterprise-wide planning. These controls are typically addressed at the
  organizational level rather than by a specific technology platform like UDS.)
