control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization develops, monitors, and reports on the results of information
  security measures of performance.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Measures of performance are outcome-based metrics used by an organization to
  measure the effectiveness or efficiency of the information security program
  and the security controls employed in support of the program.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; information security
  measures of performance; procedures addressing development, monitoring, and
  reporting of information security measures of performance; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  program planning and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational
  personnel responsible for developing, monitoring, and reporting information
  security measures of performance; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for developing, monitoring, and
  reporting information security measures of performance; automated mechanisms
  supporting the development, monitoring, and reporting of information security
  measures of performance].
