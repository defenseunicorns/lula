control-acronym: PM-14
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Implements a process for ensuring that organizational plans for conducting
  security testing, training, and monitoring activities associated with
  organizational information systems:

  1. Are developed and maintained; and

  2. Continue to be executed in a timely manner;

  b. Reviews testing, training, and monitoring plans for consistency with the
  organizational risk management strategy and organization-wide priorities for
  risk response actions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control ensures that organizations provide oversight for the security
  testing, training, and monitoring activities conducted organization-wide and
  that those activities are coordinated. With the importance of continuous
  monitoring programs, the implementation of information security across the
  three tiers of the risk management hierarchy, and the widespread use of common
  controls, organizations coordinate and consolidate the testing and monitoring
  activities that are routinely conducted as part of ongoing organizational
  assessments supporting a variety of security controls. Security training
  activities, while typically focused on individual information systems and
  specific roles, also necessitate coordination across all organizational
  elements. Testing, training, and monitoring plans and activities are informed
  by current threat and vulnerability assessments. Related controls: AT-3, CA-7,
  CP-4, IR-3, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; plans for conducting
  security testing, training, and monitoring activities; organizational
  procedures addressing development and maintenance of plans for conducting
  security testing, training, and monitoring activities; risk management
  strategy; procedures for review of plans for conducting security testing,
  training, and monitoring activities for consistency with risk management
  strategy and risk response priorities; results of risk assessments associated
  with conducting security testing, training, and monitoring activities;
  evidence that plans for conducting security testing, training, and monitoring
  activities are executed in a timely manner; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  developing and maintaining plans for conducting security testing, training,
  and monitoring activities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for development and maintenance
  of plans for conducting security testing, training, and monitoring activities;
  automated mechanisms supporting development and maintenance of plans for
  conducting security testing, training, and monitoring activities].

cci-definition: "003000: The organization implements a process for ensuring that
  organizational plans for conducting security training activities associated
  with organizational information systems are developed."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  for ensuring that organizational plans for conducting security training
  activities associated with organizational information systems are developed.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated testing development process documentation for conducting
  security training activities associated with organizational information
  systems.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed implements a process for ensuring that organizational plans
  for conducting security training activities associated with organizational
  information systems are developed.
