control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Develops a comprehensive strategy to manage risk to organizational
  operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation
  associated with the operation and use of information systems;

  b. Implements the risk management strategy consistently across the
  organization; and

  c. Reviews and updates the risk management strategy [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] or as required, to address organizational
  changes.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  An organization-wide risk management strategy includes, for example, an
  unambiguous expression of the risk tolerance for the organization, acceptable
  risk assessment methodologies, risk mitigation strategies, a process for
  consistently evaluating risk across the organization with respect to the
  organization's risk tolerance, and approaches for monitoring risk over time.
  The use of a risk executive function can facilitate consistent,
  organization-wide application of the risk management strategy. The
  organization-wide risk management strategy can be informed by risk-related
  inputs from other sources both internal and external to the organization to
  ensure the strategy is both broad-based and comprehensive. Related control:
  RA-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; risk management
  strategy; procedures addressing development, implementation, review, and
  update of the risk management strategy; risk assessment results relevant to
  the risk management strategy; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  program planning and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational
  personnel responsible for development, implementation, review, and update of
  the risk management strategy; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for development, implementation,
  review, and update of the risk management strategy; automated mechanisms
  supporting the development, implementation, review, and update of the risk
  management strategy].
