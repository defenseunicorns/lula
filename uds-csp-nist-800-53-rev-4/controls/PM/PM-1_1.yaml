  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Develops and disseminates an organization-wide information security program
  plan that:

  1. Provides an overview of the requirements for the security program and a
  description of the security program management controls and common controls in
  place or planned for meeting those requirements;

  2. Includes the identification and assignment of roles, responsibilities,
  management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and
  compliance;

  3. Reflects coordination among organizational entities responsible for the
  different aspects of information security (i.e., technical, physical,
  personnel, cyber-physical); and

  4. Is approved by a senior official with responsibility and accountability for
  the risk being incurred to organizational operations (including mission,
  functions, image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other
  organizations, and the Nation;

  b. Reviews the organization-wide information security program plan
  [Assignment: organization-defined frequency];

  c. Updates the plan to address organizational changes and problems identified
  during plan implementation or security control assessments; and

  d. Protects the information security program plan from unauthorized disclosure
  and modification.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information security program plans can be represented in single documents or
  compilations of documents at the discretion of organizations. The plans
  document the program management controls and organization-defined common
  controls. Information security program plans provide sufficient information
  about the program management controls/common controls (including specification
  of parameters for any assignment and selection statements either explicitly or
  by reference) to enable implementations that are unambiguously compliant with
  the intent of the plans and a determination of the risk to be incurred if the
  plans are implemented as intended.
   The security plans for individual information systems and the organization-wide information security program plan together, provide complete coverage for all security controls employed within the organization. Common controls are documented in an appendix to the organization's information security program plan unless the controls are included in a separate security plan for an information system (e.g., security controls employed as part of an intrusion detection system providing organization-wide boundary protection inherited by one or more organizational information systems). The organization-wide information security program plan will indicate which separate security plans contain descriptions of common controls.
   Organizations have the flexibility to describe common controls in a single document or in multiple documents. In the case of multiple documents, the documents describing common controls are included as attachments to the information security program plan. If the information security program plan contains multiple documents, the organization specifies in each document the organizational official or officials responsible for the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring of the respective common controls. For example, the organization may require that the Facilities Management Office develop, implement, assess, authorize, and continuously monitor common physical and environmental protection controls from the PE family when such controls are not associated with a particular information system but instead, support multiple information systems.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; procedures
  addressing program plan development and implementation; procedures addressing
  program plan reviews and updates; procedures addressing coordination of the
  program plan with relevant entities; procedures for program plan approvals;
  records of program plan reviews and updates; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  program planning and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for information security program
  plan development/review/update/approval; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing the information security program plan].

  DoDI 8500.01 and the Knowledge Service meet the requirement for this CCI;
  individual organizations and system owners must provide documentation of
  common control implementation in their Security Plan.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically compliant per DoDI 8500.01.
assessment-procedures: DoD components are automatically compliant with this CCI
  as they are covered at the DoD level by DoDI 8500.01 and the Knowledge
  Service. If the organization or system owner is utilizing common controls they
  must be documented in their Security Plan.
