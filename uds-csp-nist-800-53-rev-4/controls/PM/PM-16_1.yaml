control-acronym: PM-16
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization implements a threat awareness program that includes a
  cross-organization information-sharing capability.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Because of the constantly changing and increasing sophistication of
  adversaries, especially the advanced persistent threat (APT), it is becoming
  more likely that adversaries may successfully breach or compromise
  organizational information systems. One of the best techniques to address this
  concern is for organizations to share threat information. This can include,
  for example, sharing threat events (i.e., tactics, techniques, and procedures)
  that organizations have experienced, mitigations that organizations have found
  are effective against certain types of threats, threat intelligence (i.e.,
  indications and warnings about threats that are likely to occur). Threat
  information sharing may be bilateral (e.g., government-commercial
  cooperatives, government-government cooperatives), or multilateral (e.g.,
  organizations taking part in threat-sharing consortia). Threat information may
  be highly sensitive requiring special agreements and protection, or less
  sensitive and freely shared. Related controls: PM-12, PM-16.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; threat awareness
  program documentation; procedures for the threat awareness program; risk
  assessment results relevant to threat awareness; list or other documentation
  on the cross-organization information-sharing capability; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  program planning and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational
  personnel responsible for the threat awareness program; organizational
  personnel with responsibility for the cross-organization information-sharing
  capability; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; personnel with whom threat awareness information is shared
  by the organization].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for implementing the threat
  awareness program; Organizational processes for implementing the
  cross-organization information-sharing capability; automated mechanisms
  supporting and/or implementing the threat awareness program; automated
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the cross-organization
  information-sharing capability].

cci-definition: "003013: The organization implements a threat awareness program
  that includes a cross-organization information-sharing capability."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a threat
  awareness program that includes a cross-organization information-sharing
  capability.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated threat awareness program documentation that includes the
  cross-organization information-sharing capability.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented threat awareness program to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed implements a threat awareness program
  that includes a cross-organization information-sharing capability.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The Program Management
  (PM) family of controls primarily focuses on high-level organizational
  security governance, including policies, risk management strategies, and
  enterprise-wide planning. These controls are typically addressed at the
  organizational level rather than by a specific technology platform like UDS.)
