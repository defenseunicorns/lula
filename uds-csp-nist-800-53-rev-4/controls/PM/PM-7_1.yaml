control-acronym: PM-7
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization develops an enterprise architecture with consideration for
  information security and the resulting risk to organizational operations,
  organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The enterprise architecture developed by the organization is aligned with the
  Federal Enterprise Architecture. The integration of information security
  requirements and associated security controls into the organization's
  enterprise architecture helps to ensure that security considerations are
  addressed by organizations early in the system development life cycle and are
  directly and explicitly related to the organization's mission/business
  processes. This process of security requirements integration also embeds into
  the enterprise architecture, an integral information security architecture
  consistent with organizational risk management and information security
  strategies. For PM-7, the information security architecture is developed at a
  system-of-systems level (organization-wide), representing all of the
  organizational information systems. For PL-8, the information security
  architecture is developed at a level representing an individual information
  system but at the same time, is consistent with the information security
  architecture defined for the organization. Security requirements and security
  control integration are most effectively accomplished through the application
  of the Risk Management Framework and supporting security standards and
  guidelines. The Federal Segment Architecture Methodology provides guidance on
  integrating information security requirements and security controls into
  enterprise architectures. Related controls: PL-2, PL-8, PM-11, RA-2, SA-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information security program plan; enterprise
  architecture documentation; procedures addressing enterprise architecture
  development; results of risk assessment of enterprise architecture; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  program planning and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational
  personnel responsible for developing enterprise architecture; organizational
  personnel responsible for risk assessment of enterprise architecture;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for enterprise architecture
  development; automated mechanisms supporting the enterprise architecture and
  its development].
