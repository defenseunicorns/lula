control-acronym: AC-2(2)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system automatically [Selection: removes; disables] temporary
  and emergency accounts after [Assignment: organization-defined time period for
  each type of account].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement requires the removal of both temporary and emergency
  accounts automatically after a predefined period of time has elapsed, rather
  than at the convenience of the systems administrator.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; security plan; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system-generated list of temporary accounts removed and/or
  disabled; information system-generated list of emergency accounts removed
  and/or disabled; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing account management
  functions].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  never automatically remove or disable emergency accounts. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  1682. DoD has defined the time period as never. Recommended Compelling
  Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation which defines how emergency accounts are
  never disabled or removed.

  2.) Applicable STIG checks.

  3.) Log trail of emergency accounts.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to never automatically
  remove or disable emergency accounts. For information system components that
  have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 1682. DoD has defined the
  time period as never.

test-results: This enhancement requires automatically disabling or removing
  temporary or emergency accounts after a defined period. The UDS stack allows
  creation of temporary accounts (e.g., a Keycloak user account for a guest or
  emergency access) and those accounts can be given an expiration date by an
  admin which then mark them disabled. This can be done in Keycloak by creating
  a custom attribute with the 72 hour expiration value or done via the Keycloak
  Admin API using a JSON file that contains the custom attribute. Following
  security best practices it is typically not recommended to use temporary
  accounts.
