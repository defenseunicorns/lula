control-acronym: AC-12(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system:

  (a) Provides a logout capability for user-initiated communications sessions
  whenever authentication is used to gain access to [Assignment:
  organization-defined information resources]; and

  (b) Displays an explicit logout message to users indicating the reliable
  termination of authenticated communications sessions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information resources to which users gain access via authentication include,
  for example, local workstations, databases, and password-protected
  websites/web-based services. Logout messages for web page access, for example,
  can be displayed after authenticated sessions have been terminated. However,
  for some types of interactive sessions including, for example, file transfer
  protocol (FTP) sessions, information systems typically send logout messages as
  final messages prior to terminating sessions.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing session
  termination; user logout messages; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Information system session lock mechanisms].
