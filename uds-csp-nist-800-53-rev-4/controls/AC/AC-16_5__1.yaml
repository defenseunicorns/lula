control-acronym: AC-16(5)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system displays security attributes in human-readable form on
  each object that the system transmits to output devices to identify
  [Assignment: organization-identified special dissemination, handling, or
  distribution instructions] using [Assignment: organization-identified
  human-readable, standard naming conventions].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information system outputs include, for example, pages, screens, or
  equivalent. Information system output devices include, for example, printers
  and video displays on computer workstations, notebook computers, and personal
  digital assistants.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing display of
  security attributes in human-readable form; special dissemination, handling,
  or distribution instructions; types of human-readable, standard naming
  conventions; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; information system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: System output devices displaying security attributes in
  human-readable form on each object].

cci-definition: "001428: Displays security attributes in human-readable form on
  each object that the system transmits to output devices to identify
  organization-identified special dissemination, handling, or distribution
  instructions using organization-identified human-readable, standard naming
  conventions."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  display security attributes in human readable form on each object that the
  system transmits to output devices to identify special dissemination,
  handling, or distribution instructions defined in AC-16 (5), CCI 1429 using
  human readable, standard naming conventions defined in AC-16 (5), CCI 1430.
  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 1428.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to display security
  attributes in human readable form on each object that the system transmits to
  output devices to identify special dissemination, handling, or distribution
  instructions defined in AC-16 (5), CCI 1429 using human readable, standard
  naming conventions defined in AC-16 (5), CCI 1430. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 1428.

test-results: "Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS inherently supports
  the association and management of security attributes for stored, processed,
  and transmitted information through integrated infrastructure capabilities.
  However, explicitly displaying security attributes in human-readable form such
  as special dissemination, handling, or distribution instructionsâon output
  devices is typically managed at the application or client endpoint layer,
  rather than within the UDS platform itself.)"
