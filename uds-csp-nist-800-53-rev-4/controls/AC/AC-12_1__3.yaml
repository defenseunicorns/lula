control-acronym: AC-12(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system:

  (a) Provides a logout capability for user-initiated communications sessions
  whenever authentication is used to gain access to [Assignment:
  organization-defined information resources]; and

  (b) Displays an explicit logout message to users indicating the reliable
  termination of authenticated communications sessions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information resources to which users gain access via authentication include,
  for example, local workstations, databases, and password-protected
  websites/web-based services. Logout messages for web page access, for example,
  can be displayed after authenticated sessions have been terminated. However,
  for some types of interactive sessions including, for example, file transfer
  protocol (FTP) sessions, information systems typically send logout messages as
  final messages prior to terminating sessions.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing session
  termination; user logout messages; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Information system session lock mechanisms].

  communications sessions."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  display an explicit logout message to users indicating the reliable
  termination of authenticated communications sessions. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  2364.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks

  2.)
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to display an explicit
  logout message to users indicating the reliable termination of authenticated
  communications sessions. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 2364.

test-results: Within UDS, when a user clicks "logout," they receive a
  confirmation prompt. Once confirmed, Keycloak terminates the user's session.
  Because Keycloak functions as the centralized Single Sign-On (SSO) provider
  for all UDS applications, logging out of Keycloak results in the user being
  signed out of the entire system.
