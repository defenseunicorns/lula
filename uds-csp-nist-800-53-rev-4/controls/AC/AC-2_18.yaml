  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Identifies and selects the following types of information system accounts
  to support organizational missions/business functions: [Assignment:
  organization-defined information system account types];

  b. Assigns account managers for information system accounts;

  c. Establishes conditions for group and role membership;

  d. Specifies authorized users of the information system, group and role
  membership, and access authorizations (i.e., privileges) and other attributes
  (as required) for each account;

  e. Requires approvals by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]
  for requests to create information system accounts;

  f. Creates, enables, modifies, disables, and removes information system
  accounts in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined procedures or
  conditions];

  g. Monitors the use of information system accounts;

  h. Notifies account managers:

  1. When accounts are no longer required;

  2. When users are terminated or transferred; and

  3. When individual information system usage or need-to-know changes;

  i. Authorizes access to the information system based on:

  1. A valid access authorization;

  2. Intended system usage; and

  3. Other attributes as required by the organization or associated
  missions/business functions;

  j. Reviews accounts for compliance with account management requirements
  [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and

  k. Establishes a process for reissuing shared/group account credentials (if
  deployed) when individuals are removed from the group.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information system account types include, for example, individual, shared,
  group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor,
  temporary, and service. Some of the account management requirements listed
  above can be implemented by organizational information systems. The
  identification of authorized users of the information system and the
  specification of access privileges reflects the requirements in other security
  controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on
  information system accounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate
  organizational personnel (e.g., system owner, mission/business owner, or chief
  information security officer) responsible for approving such accounts and
  privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or
  other attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both.
  Other attributes required for authorizing access include, for example,
  restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining
  other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements
  (e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades) and mission/business
  requirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer requirements, remote
  access to support travel requirements). Failure to consider these factors
  could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency accounts
  are accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary
  accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a
  need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account
  activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis
  situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore,
  emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization
  processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with
  infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used for special tasks
  defined by organizations or when network resources are unavailable). Such
  accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or
  removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include, for
  example: (i) when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer
  required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated. Some types
  of information system accounts may require specialized training. Related

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; security plan; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation; list
  of active system accounts along with the name of the individual associated
  with each account; list of conditions for group and role membership;
  notifications or records of recently transferred, separated, or terminated
  employees; list of recently disabled information system accounts along with
  the name of the individual associated with each account; access authorization
  records; account management compliance reviews; information system monitoring
  records; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes account management on the
  information system; automated mechanisms for implementing account management].

  The organization being inspected/assessed implements a process to notify
  account managers when individual information system usage or need-to-know
  changes. The organization being inspected/assessed maintains an audit trail of
  notifications.

  managers when individual information system usage or need-to-know changes.

  2.) Audit trail of notifications.
