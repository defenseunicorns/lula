control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Monitors information system accounts for [Assignment: organization-defined
  atypical use]; and

  (b) Reports atypical usage of information system accounts to [Assignment:
  organization-defined personnel or roles].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  A typical usage includes, for example, accessing information systems at
  certain times of the day and from locations that are not consistent with the
  normal usage patterns of individuals working in organizations. Related
  control: CA-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; information system
  monitoring records; information system audit records; audit tracking and
  monitoring reports; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing account management
  functions].

  for organization-defined atypical use."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed monitors information system accounts
  for atypical use defined in AC-2 (12), CCI 2146. The organization must
  maintain an audit trail of monitoring.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation which defines the process for monitoring
  information system accounts for organization-defined atypical use.

  2.) Audit trail of monitoring.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the audit trail of monitoring to ensure the organization
  being inspected/assessed monitors information system accounts for atypical use
  defined in AC-2 (12), CCI 2146.

test-results: "Keycloak generates detailed login, logout, and admin event logs.
  Those logs can be viewed in the Keycloak Admin Event log or can be written to
  a JSON or other structured format compatible with Vector. The Vector
  configuration can be set up as a âsourceâ that ingests Keycloak logs from
  the appropriate file or stream, apply any parsing or filtering needed, and
  define a âsinkâ that forwards the data to Loki.  Loki can then be used to
  parse and analyze fields (e.g., event type, user ID, IP address) for anomalies
  such as excessive failed logins within a defined interval or unexpected admin
  actions. Loki with Grafana can be used to set up alert rules to trigger
  notifications when these queries exceed thresholds that indicate suspicious or
  atypical activity according to the organization."
