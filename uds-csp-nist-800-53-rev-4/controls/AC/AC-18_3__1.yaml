control-acronym: AC-18(3)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization disables, when not intended for use, wireless networking
  capabilities internally embedded within information system components prior to
  issuance and deployment.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related control: AC-19.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing wireless
  implementation and usage (including restrictions); information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms managing the disabling of wireless
  networking capabilities internally embedded within information system
  components].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to disable wireless networking capabilities internally embedded within
  information system components prior to issuance and deployment when not
  intended for use.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation (Standard Operating Procedures, Concept of
  Operations, or System Security plan) that describes the process of how the
  site disables, when not intended for use, wireless networking capabilities
  internally embedded within information system components prior to issuance and
  deployment.

  2.) Sampling of information system (network diagram)
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed disables, when not intended for use, wireless networking
  capabilities internally embedded within information system components prior to
  issuance and deployment. The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines a sampling of information systems to ensure that any
  internally embedded wireless networking capabilities are disabled unless a
  documented need exists.

remote-inheritance-instance: "-"
test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS does not inherently
  control the use of wireless networking. Any wireless access control would be
  handled by the underlying network infrastructure, not by UDS itself i.e.
  wireless network adapters and bluetooth would be enabled/disabled at the
  operating system.)
