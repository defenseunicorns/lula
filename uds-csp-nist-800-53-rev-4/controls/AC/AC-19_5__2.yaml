control-acronym: AC-19(5)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs [Selection: full-device encryption; container
  encryption] to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information on
  [Assignment: organization-defined mobile devices].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Container-based encryption provides a more fine-grained approach to the
  encryption of data/information on mobile devices, including for example,
  encrypting selected data structures such as files, records, or fields. Related
  controls: MP-5, SC-13, SC-28.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing access
  control for mobile devices; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  encryption mechanism s and associated configuration documentation; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with access control
  responsibilities for mobile devices; system/network administrators;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Encryption mechanisms protecting confidentiality and
  integrity of information on mobile devices].

cci-definition: "002329: The organization defines the mobile devices that are to
  employ full-device or container encryption to protect the confidentiality and
  integrity of the information on device."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the mobile
  devices that are to employ full-device or container encryption to protect the
  confidentiality and integrity of the information on device. DoD has determined
  the mobile devices are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan (SSP)

  2.) Signed and dated mobile devices policy that defines the mobile devices
  (make and model) that are to employ full-device or container encryption to
  protect the confidentiality and integrity of the information on device.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented mobile devices to ensure the organization
  being inspected/assessed defines the mobile devices that are to employ
  full-device or container encryption to protect the confidentiality and
  integrity of the information on device. DoD has determined the mobile devices
  are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Though UDS support FIPS
  encryption this control refers to policies for mobile device access. UDS is
  accessed via standard information systems; any mobile device management or
  controls are outside the scope of the UDS technology stack.)
