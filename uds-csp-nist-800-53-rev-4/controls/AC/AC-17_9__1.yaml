control-acronym: AC-17(9)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization provides the capability to expeditiously disconnect or
  disable remote access to the information system within [Assignment:
  organization-defined time period].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement requires organizations to have the capability to
  rapidly disconnect current users remotely accessing the information system
  and/or disable further remote access. The speed of disconnect or disablement
  varies based on the criticality of missions/business functions and the need to
  eliminate immediate or future remote access to organizational information
  systems.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing
  disconnecting or disabling remote access to the information system;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; security plan, information system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing capability to disconnect
  or disable remote access to information system].
