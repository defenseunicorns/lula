  Description:

  The information system:

  a. Displays to users [Assignment: organization-defined system use notification
  message or banner] before granting access to the system that provides privacy
  and security notices consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive
  Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance and states
  that:

  1. Users are accessing a U.S. Government information system;

  2. Information system usage may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit;

  3. Unauthorized use of the information system is prohibited and subject to
  criminal and civil penalties; and

  4. Use of the information system indicates consent to monitoring and
  recording;

  b. Retains the notification message or banner on the screen until users
  acknowledge the usage conditions and take explicit actions to log on to or
  further access the information system; and

  c. For publicly accessible systems:

  1. Displays system use information [Assignment: organization-defined
  conditions], before granting further access;

  2. Displays references, if any, to monitoring, recording, or auditing that are
  consistent with privacy accommodations for such systems that generally
  prohibit those activities; and

  3. Includes a description of the authorized uses of the system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  System use notifications can be implemented using messages or warning banners
  displayed before individuals log in to information systems. System use
  notifications are used only for access via logon interfaces with human users
  and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist. Organizations
  consider system use notification messages/banners displayed in multiple
  languages based on specific organizational needs and the demographics of
  information system users. Organizations also consult with the Office of the
  General Counsel for legal review and approval of warning banner content.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; privacy and security policies,
  procedures addressing system use notification; documented approval of
  information system use notification messages or banners; information system
  audit records; user acknowledgements of notification message or banner;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; information system use notification
  messages; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with responsibility for providing legal advice; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing system use
  notification].

  laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and
  guidance."
implementation-guidance: "The organization being inspected/assessed configures
  the information system to display the DoD Information Systems â Standard
  Consent Banner and User Agreement before granting access to the system that
  provides privacy and security notices consistent with applicable federal laws,
  Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.
  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 48. DoD has defined the use notification message or
  banner as the content of DTM 08-060, \"Policy on Use of Department of Defense
  (DoD) Information Systems â Standard Consent Banner and User Agreement,\"
  March 2013.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Standard Consent Banner

  2.) Standard User Agreement

  3.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks"
assessment-procedures: "The organization conducting the inspection/assessment

  granting access to the system that provides privacy and security notices
  consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,

  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 48. DoD has defined the
