control-acronym: AC-3(4)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system enforces [Assignment: organization-defined
  discretionary access control policies] over defined subjects and objects where
  the policy specifies that a subject that has been granted access to
  information can do one or more of the following:

  (a) Pass the information to any other subjects or objects;

  (b) Grant its privileges to other subjects;

  (c) Change security attributes on subjects, objects, the information system,
  or the information system's components;

  (d) Choose the security attributes to be associated with newly created or
  revised objects; or

  (e) Change the rules governing access control.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not
  constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for
  which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been
  granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the
  subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or
  objects. This control enhancement can operate in conjunction with AC-3 (3). A
  subject that is constrained in its operation by policies governed by AC-3 (3)
  is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this control
  enhancement. Thus, while AC-3(3) imposes constraints preventing a subject from
  passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity
  level, AC-3 (4) permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at
  the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the information system
  boundary. Once the information is passed outside of the control of the
  information system, additional means may be required to ensure that the
  constraints remain in effect. While the older, more traditional definitions of
  discretionary access control require identity-based access control, that
  limitation is not required for this use of discretionary access control.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; discretionary access control
  policies; procedures addressing access enforcement; security plan; information
  system design documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; list of subjects and objects (i.e., users and
  resources) requiring enforcement of discretionary access control policies;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with access enforcement
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing discretionary access
  control policy].

cci-definition: "002164: Enforce organization-defined discretionary access
  control policy that over the set of covered subjects and objects specified in
  the policy, and where the policy specifies that a subject that has been
  granted access to information can do one or more of the following: pass the
  information to any other subjects or objects; grant its privileges to other
  subjects; change security attributes on subjects, objects, the information
  system, or the information system's components; choose the security attributes
  to be associated with newly created or revised objects; and/or change the
  rules governing access control."
implementation-guidance: "The organization being inspected/assessed documents
  the discretionary access control policies that a subject which has been
  granted access to information can do one or more of the following: pass the
  information to any other subjects or objects; grant its privileges to other
  subjects; change security attributes on subjects, objects, the information
  system, or the information systemâs components; choose the security
  attributes to be associated with newly created or revised objects; and/or
  change the rules governing access control.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated discretionary access control policies."
assessment-procedures: "The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented discretionary access control policies to
  ensure the organization being inspected/assessed specifies that a subject
  which has been granted access to information can do one or more of the
  following: pass the information to any other subjects or objects; grant its
  privileges to other subjects; change security attributes on subjects, objects,
  the information system, or the information systemâs components; choose the
  security attributes to be associated with newly created or revised objects;
  and/or change the rules governing access control."

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS primarily implements
  role-based access control (RBAC) rather than discretionary access control
  (DAC). There is no user-driven file permission model within the container
  platform for end-users; access decisions are centrally enforced by system
  policy (Keycloak/Istio), not at the discretion of individual users. Thus, DAC
  policies are not applicable to this stack.)
