control-acronym: AC-1
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles]:

  1. An access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
  responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational
  entities, and compliance; and

  2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy
  and associated access controls; and

  b. Reviews and updates the current:

  1. Access control policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and

  2. Access control procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
  effective implementation of selected security controls and control
  enhancements in the AC family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable
  federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
  and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization
  level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures
  unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information
  security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by
  multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The
  procedures can be established for the security program in general and for
  particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
  strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related
  control: PM-9.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy and procedures; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with access control
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].
