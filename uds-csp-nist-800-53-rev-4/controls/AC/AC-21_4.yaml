control-acronym: AC-21
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Facilitates information sharing by enabling authorized users to determine
  whether access authorizations assigned to the sharing partner match the access
  restrictions on the information for [Assignment: organization-defined
  information sharing circumstances where user discretion is required]; and

  b. Employs [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms or manual
  processes] to assist users in making information sharing/collaboration
  decisions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control applies to information that may be restricted in some manner
  (e.g., privileged medical information, contract-sensitive information,
  proprietary information, personally identifiable information, classified
  information related to special access programs or compartments) based on some
  formal or administrative determination. Depending on the particular
  information-sharing circumstances, sharing partners may be defined at the
  individual, group, or organizational level. Information may be defined by
  content, type, security category, or special access program/compartment.
  Related control: AC-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing user-based
  collaboration and information sharing (including restrictions); information
  system design documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; list of users authorized to make information
  sharing/collaboration decisions; list of information sharing circumstances
  requiring user discretion; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel responsible for making
  information sharing/collaboration decisions; system/network administrators;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms or manual process implementing access
  authorizations supporting information sharing/user collaboration decisions].

cci-definition: "001472: The organization defines the automated mechanisms or
  manual processes required to assist users in making information
  sharing/collaboration decisions."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the automated
  mechanisms or manual processes required to assist users in making information
  sharing/collaboration decisions. DoD has determined the automated mechanisms
  or manual processes are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation that describes and defines the automated
  mechanisms or manual processes required to assist users in making information
  sharing/collaboration decisions.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented automated mechanisms to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed defines the automated mechanisms or
  manual processes required to assist users in making information
  sharing/collaboration decisions. DoD has determined the automated mechanisms
  or manual processes are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

test-results: "Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The UDS stack itself
  doesnât facilitate user-to-user information sharing beyond hosting
  applications that might do so. However, it provides controls to ensure that
  any sharing of data through UDS applications is access-controlled. For
  instance, if two users from different projects use an application on UDS,
  Keycloak can enforce that each user only accesses their authorized project
  data. So, while UDS doesnât implement a policy for information sharing, it
  enables secure sharing by honoring the access rules configured (no
  unauthorized cross-tenant data access, etc.). Also, audit logs (through Loki)
  can track when information is accessed or shared.)"
