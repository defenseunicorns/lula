control-acronym: AC-14
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Identifies [Assignment: organization-defined user actions] that can be
  performed on the information system without identification or authentication
  consistent with organizational missions/business functions; and

  b. Documents and provides supporting rationale in the security plan for the
  information system, user actions not requiring identification or
  authentication.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control addresses situations in which organizations determine that no
  identification or authentication is required in organizational information
  systems. Organizations may allow a limited number of user actions without
  identification or authentication including, for example, when individuals
  access public websites or other publicly accessible federal information
  systems, when individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when
  facsimiles are received. Organizations also identify actions that normally
  require identification or authentication but may under certain circumstances
  (e.g., emergencies), allow identification or authentication mechanisms to be
  bypassed. Such bypasses may occur, for example, via a software-readable
  physical switch that commands bypass of the logon functionality and is
  protected from accidental or unmonitored use. This control does not apply to
  situations where identification and authentication have already occurred and
  are not repeated, but rather to situations where identification and
  authentication have not yet occurred. Organizations may decide that there are
  no user actions that can be performed on organizational information systems
  without identification and authentication and thus, the values for assignment
  statements can be none. Related controls: CP-2, IA-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing permitted
  actions without identification or authentication; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; security plan; list of
  user actions that can be performed without identification or authentication;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents supporting rationale in
  the security plan for the actions defined in AC-14, CCI 61 to not require
  identification and authentication.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation that defines the supporting rationale in
  the security plan for the actions defined in AC-14, CCI 61 to not require
  identification and authentication.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the security plan to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed documents the supporting rationale for the actions defined
  in AC-14, CCI 61 to not require identification and authentication.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS inherently enforces
  strong authentication and identification through its centralized identity
  management system, Keycloak, ensuring all interactions with sensitive or
  protected resources require identification and authentication. While the
  platform supports granular access control and typically mandates
  authentication for most actions, explicitly defining which specific user
  actions (such as accessing public-facing status pages or health-check
  endpoints) may be permitted without authentication is an organizational
  decision. Organizations deploying UDS must formally define, document, and
  explicitly approve any exceptions to authentication requirements, clearly
  specifying permissible unauthenticated actions (e.g., public API health checks
  or metrics endpoints) within their security policies or Standard Operating
  Procedures (SOPs). Although UDS technically supports enforcing strong
  authentication standards, the explicit definition of allowed unauthenticated
  interactions remains an organizational responsibility.)
