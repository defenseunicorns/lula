control-acronym: AC-19(5)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs [Selection: full-device encryption; container
  encryption] to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information on
  [Assignment: organization-defined mobile devices].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Container-based encryption provides a more fine-grained approach to the
  encryption of data/information on mobile devices, including for example,
  encrypting selected data structures such as files, records, or fields. Related
  controls: MP-5, SC-13, SC-28.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing access
  control for mobile devices; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  encryption mechanism s and associated configuration documentation; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with access control
  responsibilities for mobile devices; system/network administrators;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Encryption mechanisms protecting confidentiality and
  integrity of information on mobile devices].

cci: 2331
cci-definition: "002331: Employs full-device encryption or container encryption
  to protect the integrity of information on organization-defined mobile
  devices."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  for full-device encryption or container encryption to protect the integrity of
  information on mobile devices defined in AC-19 (5), CCI 2329.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan (SSP)

  2.) Signed and dated mobile devices policy that describes how the organization
  employs full-device encryption or container encryption to protect the
  integrity of information on mobile devices defined in AC-19 (5), CCI 2329.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed employs full-device encryption or container encryption to
  protect the integrity of information on mobile devices defined in AC-19 (5),
  CCI 2329.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (Though UDS support FIPS
  encryption this control refers to policies for mobile device access. UDS is
  accessed via standard information systems; any mobile device management or
  controls are outside the scope of the UDS technology stack.)
