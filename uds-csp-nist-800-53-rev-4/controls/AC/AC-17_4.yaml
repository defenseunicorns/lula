control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization

  a. Establishes and documents usage restrictions, configuration/connection
  requirements, and implementation guidance for each type of remote access
  allowed; and

  b. Authorizes remote access to the information system prior to allowing such
  connections.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Remote access is access to organizational information systems by users (or
  processes acting on behalf of users) communicating through external networks
  (e.g., the Internet). Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up,
  broadband, and wireless. Organizations often employ encrypted virtual private
  networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity over remote
  connections. The use of encrypted VPNs does not make the access non-remote;
  however, the use of VPNs, when adequately provisioned with appropriate
  security controls (e.g., employing appropriate encryption techniques for
  confidentiality and integrity protection) may provide sufficient assurance to
  the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as internal
  networks. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted
  VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections. Also, VPNs with
  encrypted tunnels can affect the organizational capability to adequately
  monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access
  controls apply to information systems other than public web servers or systems
  designed for public access. This control addresses authorization prior to
  allowing remote access without specifying the formats for such authorization.
  While organizations may use interconnection security agreements to authorize
  remote access connections, such agreements are not required by this control.
  Enforcing access restrictions for remote connections is addressed in AC-3.

  Added by [r4] Privacy (Confidentiality Impact Level: Moderate) Overlay: Allow
  remote access to PII only with two-factor authentication where one of the
  factors is provided by a device separate from the computer gaining access.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing remote
  access implementation and usage (including restrictions); configuration
  management plan; security plan; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; remote access authorizations; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  managing remote access connections; system/network administrators;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Remote access management capability for the information
  system].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] Privacy (Confidentiality Impact Level: Moderate) Overlay:
  Limiting access to PII from remote networks and/or restricting activities that
  can be conducted with PII remotely reduces the risk of intentional and
  unintentional disclosures of PII that may not exist on an internal network.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated Access Control Policy

  2.) Most current Network topology diagram

  3.) Signed and dated Standard user agreements.

  4.) Signed and dated Privileged user agreement.

  5.) Documentation that establishes and documents implementation guidance for
  each type of remote access allowed.

  obtains and examines the documented implementation guidance to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed establishes and documents implementation
  guidance for each type of remote access allowed.
