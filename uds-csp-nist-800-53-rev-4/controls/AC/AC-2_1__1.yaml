control-acronym: AC-2(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs automated mechanisms to support the management of
  information system accounts.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text
  messaging to automatically notify account managers when users are terminated
  or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and
  using telephonic notification to report atypical system account usage.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; information system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing account management
  functions].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  employ automated mechanisms to support the information system account
  management functions. For information system components that have applicable
  STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the
  STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 000015.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated SSP, which defines the automated mechanisms used to
  support account management.

  2.) Applicable STIG checks.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to employ automated
  mechanisms to support the information system account management functions. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 000015.

test-results: UDS supports automated mechanisms for account management via
  Keycloak. Keycloak automates many account management functions (creation,
  disablement, role assignments) through its interface and APIs, reducing the
  need for manual processes and meeting the intent of AC-2(1).
