control-acronym: AC-11(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system conceals, via the session lock, information previously
  visible on the display with a publicly viewable image.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Publicly viewable images can include static or dynamic images, for example,
  patterns used with screen savers, photographic images, solid colors, clock,
  battery life indicator, or a blank screen, with the additional caveat that
  none of the images convey sensitive information.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing session
  lock; display screen with session lock activated; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Information system session lock mechanisms].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  conceal, via the session lock, information previously visible on the display
  with a publicly viewable image. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 60.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan (SSP)

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to conceal, via the
  session lock, information previously visible on the display with a publicly
  viewable image. For information system components that have applicable STIGs
  or SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the
  components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 60.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (By default, Keycloak
  doesn't automatically change the user's screen when a session expires due to
  inactivity. Instead, the current page remains displayed, and the session
  timeout occurs silently on the server side. Only when the user attempts
  another interaction, like navigating or submitting a form, will the session
  expiration become apparent, prompting a redirect to Keycloak's login screen
  for reauthentication. To proactively handle this, applications can implement
  custom logic, such as client-side timers or periodic background checks, to
  detect inactivity and prompt the user accordingly, but this behavior isn't
  provided automatically by Keycloak.)
