  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Provides the means to associate [Assignment: organization-defined types of
  security attributes] having [Assignment: organization-defined security
  attribute values] with information in storage, in process, and/or in
  transmission;

  b. Ensures that the security attribute associations are made and retained with
  the information;

  c. Establishes the permitted [Assignment: organization-defined security
  attributes] for [Assignment: organization-defined information systems]; and

  d. Determines the permitted [Assignment: organization-defined values or
  ranges] for each of the established security attributes.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information is represented internally within information systems using
  abstractions known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent
  different types of entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also
  known as subjects, are typically associated with individuals, devices, or
  processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as
  objects, are typically associated with data structures such as records,
  buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and communications ports.
  Security attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions representing the
  basic properties or characteristics of active and passive entities with
  respect to safeguarding information. These attributes may be associated with
  active entities (i.e., subjects) that have the potential to send or receive
  information, to cause information to flow among objects, or to change the
  information system state. These attributes may also be associated with passive
  entities (i.e., objects) that contain or receive information. The association
  of security attributes to subjects and objects is referred to as binding and
  is typically inclusive of setting the attribute value and the attribute type.
  Security attributes when bound to data/information, enables the enforcement of
  information security policies for access control and information flow control,
  either through organizational processes or information system functions or
  mechanisms. The content or assigned values of security attributes can directly
  affect the ability of individuals to access organizational information.

  Organizations can define the types of attributes needed for selected
  information systems to support missions/business functions. There is
  potentially a wide range of values that can be assigned to any given security
  attribute. Release markings could include, for example, US only, NATO, or
  NOFORN (not releasable to foreign nationals). By specifying permitted
  attribute ranges and values, organizations can ensure that the security
  attribute values are meaningful and relevant. The term security labeling
  refers to the association of security attributes with subjects and objects
  represented by internal data structures within organizational information
  systems, to enable information system-based enforcement of information
  security policies. Security labels include, for example, access
  authorizations, data life cycle protection (i.e., encryption and data
  expiration), nationality, affiliation as contractor, and classification of
  information in accordance with legal and compliance requirements. The term
  security marking refers to the association of security attributes with objects
  in a human-readable form, to enable organizational process-based enforcement
  of information security policies. The AC-16 base control represents the
  requirement for user-based attribute association (marking). The enhancements
  to AC-16 represent additional requirements including information system-based
  attribute association (labeling). Types of attributes include, for example,
  classification level for objects and clearance (access authorization) level
  for subjects. An example of a value for both of these attribute types is Top
  Secret. Related controls: AC-3, AC-4, AC-6, AC-21, AU-2, AU-10, SC-16, MP-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing the
  association of security attributes to information in storage, in process, and
  in transmission; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; information system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational capability supporting and maintaining the
  association of security attributes to information in storage, in process, and
  in transmission].

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation that defines the process to ensure that the
  security attribute associations are retained with the information.

  obtains and examines the documented process to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed ensures that the security attribute associations are
  retained with the information.
