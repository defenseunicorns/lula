control-acronym: AC-2(2)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system automatically [Selection: removes; disables] temporary
  and emergency accounts after [Assignment: organization-defined time period for
  each type of account].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement requires the removal of both temporary and emergency
  accounts automatically after a predefined period of time has elapsed, rather
  than at the convenience of the systems administrator.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; security plan; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system-generated list of temporary accounts removed and/or
  disabled; information system-generated list of emergency accounts removed
  and/or disabled; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing account management
  functions].
