control-acronym: AC-6(10)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system prevents non-privileged users from executing privileged
  functions to include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented
  security safeguards/countermeasures.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Privileged functions include, for example, establishing information system
  accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic
  key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals that do not
  possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and
  prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of
  privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing least
  privilege; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; list of privileged
  functions and associated user account assignments; information system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  defining least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities; system
  developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing least privilege
  functions for non-privileged users].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions to include
  disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security
  safeguards/countermeasures. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 2235.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated access control policy

  2.) Signed and dated system security plan (SSP)

  3.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks

  4.) Documentation that shows the system is configured to prevent
  non-privileged users from executing privileged functions to include disabling,
  circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards/countermeasures.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to prevent non-privileged
  users from executing privileged functions to include disabling, circumventing,
  or altering implemented security safeguards/countermeasures. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization
  conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that
  the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the information
  system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI
  2235.

test-results: The UDS information system prevents non-privileged users from
  executing privileged functions, including disabling, circumventing, or
  altering implemented security safeguards and countermeasures. UDS utilizes
  Keycloak to manage user groups, and roles, which defines the separation of
  duties. This ensures that only authorized users can perform privileged
  functions such as establishing information system accounts, performing system
  integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities.
  Additionally, Pepr policies are implemented to prevent privilege escalation,
  ensuring that non-privileged users cannot gain unauthorized access to
  privileged functions. Istio Gateways further enhance security by segregating
  admin and user traffic to services within the system, ensuring that
  non-privileged users cannot interfere with administrative functions. These
  measures collectively enforce the principle of least privilege and protect
  privileged functions from unauthorized access, ensuring compliance with the
  control requirements.
