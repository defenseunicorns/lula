control-acronym: AC-6(8)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system prevents [Assignment: organization-defined software]
  from executing at higher privilege levels than users executing the software.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  In certain situations, software applications/programs need to execute with
  elevated privileges to perform required functions. However, if the privileges
  required for execution are at a higher level than the privileges assigned to
  organizational users invoking such applications/programs, those users are
  indirectly provided with greater privileges than assigned by organizations.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing least
  privilege; list of software that should not execute at higher privilege levels
  than users executing software; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  defining least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing least privilege
  functions for software execution].

cci-definition: "002233: The information system prevents organization-defined
  software from executing at higher privilege levels than users executing the
  software."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  any software except software explicitly documented from executing at higher
  privilege levels than users executing the software. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  2233. DoD has defined the software as any software except software explicitly
  documented.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks

  2.) Documentation that shows the system is configured to any software except
  software explicitly documented from executing at higher privilege levels than
  users executing the software.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to prevent any software
  except software explicitly documented from executing at higher privilege
  levels than users executing the software. For information system components
  that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 2233. DoD has defined the
  software as any software except software explicitly documented.

test-results: UDS prevents unauthorized execution of software at higher
  privilege levels through multiple integrated security mechanisms.
  Specifically, Kubernetes employs built-in security policies and Role-Based
  Access Control (RBAC) to explicitly define and enforce the privileges under
  which software executes, ensuring containerized applications do not run with
  privileges exceeding those granted to the user deploying or managing the
  software. UDS enforces a Pepr policy that prevents privilege escalation for
  pods running within the system, ensuring that software does not execute at
  higher privilege levels than the users executing the software. Additionally,
  UDS implements Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) at the
  operating system layer to ensure that applications cannot run with elevated
  privileges beyond those assigned to the users invoking them. These measures
  collectively prevent organization-defined software from executing at higher
  privilege levels than users, in compliance with the control requirements.
