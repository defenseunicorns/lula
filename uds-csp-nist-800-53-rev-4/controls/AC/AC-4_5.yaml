  Description:

  The information system enforces approved authorizations for controlling the
  flow of information within the system and between interconnected systems based
  on [Assignment: organization-defined information flow control policies].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel
  within an information system and between information systems (as opposed to
  who is allowed to access the information) and without explicit regard to
  subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include,
  for example, keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in
  the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from
  within the organization, restricting web requests to the Internet that are not
  from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between
  organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring information
  between information systems representing different security domains with
  different security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or
  more domain security policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards
  provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between
  interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific
  architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies.
  Enforcement includes, for example: (i) prohibiting information transfers
  between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing access only); (ii) employing
  hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows; and (iii)
  implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes
  and security labels.

  Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and
  enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated
  sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) within
  information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based
  on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path.
  Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices (e.g.,
  gateways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule sets
  or establish configuration settings that restrict information system services,
  provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or
  message-filtering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key
  word searches or using document characteristics). Organizations also consider
  the trustworthiness of filtering/inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware,
  firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow
  enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 22 primarily address cross-domain
  solution needs which focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth
  analysis, and stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain
  products, for example, high-assurance guards. Such capabilities are generally
  not available in commercial off-the-shelf information technology products.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; information flow control
  policies; procedures addressing information flow enforcement; information
  system design documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; information system baseline configuration; list of
  information flow authorizations; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing information flow
  enforcement policy].

  2.) Signed and dated data flow diagram.

  3.) Signed and dated documentation that defines approved authorizations for
  controlling the flow of information

test-results: UDS information flow control policies are achieved through network
  segmentation and service mesh policies. Istio can implement policies that
  restrict services from talking to each other except as allowed (for example,
  service A cannot call database B unless a policy allows it). Also, NeuVector
  provides Layer-7 firewalling between containers, so even if Kubernetes
  networking would allow two pods to communicate, NeuVector can block flows that
  violate defined security policies or that are not part of a learned normal
  behavior. This means UDS can enforce that data only flows between components
  that should exchange information. UDS covers typical use cases (e.g.,
  preventing a dev namespace service from contacting a prod database) via
  network policy, but it does not inherently label data or enforce policy by
  data content. UDS meets the core intent (network-level info flow control) by
  segmenting and gating traffic.
