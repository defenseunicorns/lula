control-acronym: AC-12
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system automatically terminates a user session after
  [Assignment: organization-defined conditions or trigger events requiring
  session disconnect].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in
  contrast to SC-10 which addresses the termination of network connections that
  are associated with communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect). A
  logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever
  a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational
  information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate
  user access) without terminating network sessions. Session termination
  terminates all processes associated with a user's logical session except those
  processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to
  continue after the session is terminated. Conditions or trigger events
  requiring automatic session termination can include, for example,
  organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain
  types of incidents, time-of-day restrictions on information system use.
  Related controls: SC-10, SC-23.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing session
  termination; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; list of conditions or
  trigger events requiring session disconnect; information system audit records;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing user session
  termination].

cci-definition: "002360: The organization defines the conditions or trigger
  events requiring session disconnect to be employed by the information system
  when automatically terminating a user session."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the conditions
  or trigger events requiring session disconnect to be employed by the
  information system when automatically terminating a user session. DoD has
  determined the conditions or trigger events are not appropriate to define at
  the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan (SSP)

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks

  3.) Signed and dated documentation that defines the conditions or trigger
  events requiring session disconnect to be employed by the information system
  when automatically terminating a user session.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented conditions or trigger events to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed defines the conditions or trigger events
  requiring session disconnect to be employed by the information system when
  automatically terminating a user session. DoD has determined the conditions or
  trigger events are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

test-results: "UDS supports reliable session termination. When a user logs out
  of an application (or out of Keycloak), Keycloakâs single sign-out
  functionality ends the userâs session for all client applications logged in
  via that token. This ensures that all associated sessions are invalidated upon
  user logoutâ. Also, sessions are terminated when their allotted time expires
  (as configured). On the administrative side, an admin can explicitly revoke a
  userâs sessions in Keycloak at any time (for example, if a user is suspected
  compromised, an admin can force-log-out that account from all services). In
  the service mesh, if a token is no longer valid, AuthService will reject
  further requests with that token. Thus, whether the session ends normally
  (user logout) or abnormally (token expiration or manual revocation), UDS
  cleanly terminates the session and prevents further use of those credentials.
  This behavior satisfies the requirement for session termination."
