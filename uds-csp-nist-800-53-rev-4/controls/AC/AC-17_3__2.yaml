control-acronym: AC-17(3)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system routes all remote accesses through [Assignment:
  organization-defined number] managed network access control points.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Limiting the number of access control points for remote accesses reduces the
  attack surface for organizations. Organizations consider the Trusted Internet
  Connections (TIC) initiative requirements for external network connections.
  Related control: SC-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing remote
  access to the information system; information system design documentation;
  list of all managed network access control points; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; information system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms routing all remote accesses through
  managed network access control points].

cci: 1561
cci-definition: "001561: The organization defines managed access control points
  for remote access to the information system."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents managed access
  control points for remote access to the information system.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation (ex. network flow chart, network diagram,
  hardware inventory sheet and/or other document that will list all remote
  access points) that defines managed access control points for remote access to
  the information system.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented managed access points to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed defines managed access control points
  for remote access to the information system.
