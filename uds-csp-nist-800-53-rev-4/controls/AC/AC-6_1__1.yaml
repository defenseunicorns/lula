control-acronym: AC-6(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization explicitly authorizes access to [Assignment:
  organization-defined security functions (deployed in hardware, software, and
  firmware) and security-relevant information].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Security functions include, for example, establishing system accounts,
  configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting
  events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters.
  Security-relevant information includes, for example, filtering rules for
  routers/firewalls, cryptographic key management information, configuration
  parameters for security services, and access control lists. Explicitly
  authorized personnel include, for example, security administrators, system and
  network administrators, system security officers, system maintenance
  personnel, system programmers, and other privileged users. Related controls:
  AC-17, AC-18, AC-19.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing least
  privilege; list of security functions (deployed in hardware, software, and
  firmware) and security-relevant information for which access must be
  explicitly authorized; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  defining least privileges necessary to accomplish specified tasks;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing least privilege
  functions].

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  Automatically compliant
assessment-procedures: The organization being inspected/assessed is
  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the security functions as all functions not publicly
  accessible.

test-results: This control has been inherited and will receive test results from
