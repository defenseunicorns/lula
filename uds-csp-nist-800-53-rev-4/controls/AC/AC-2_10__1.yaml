  Description:

  The information system terminates shared/group account credentials when
  members leave the group.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; account access
  termination records; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing account management
  functions].

cci-definition: "002142: The information system terminates shared/group account
  credentials when members leave the group."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  terminate shared/group account credentials when members leave the group. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 2142.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation which defines the process of
  disabling/revoking shared/group accounts when members leave the group.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to terminate shared/group
  account credentials when members leave the group. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 2142.

  organizational decision on if shared/group accounts are required. It is best
  practice to avoid the use of shared/group accounts in most scenarios.)
