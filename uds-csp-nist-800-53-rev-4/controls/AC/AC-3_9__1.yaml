control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system does not release information outside of the established
  system boundary unless:

  (a) The receiving [Assignment: organization-defined information system or
  system component] provides [Assignment: organization-defined security
  safeguards]; and

  (b) [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] are used to
  validate the appropriateness of the information designated for release.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information systems can only protect organizational information within the
  confines of established system boundaries. Additional security safeguards may
  be needed to ensure that such information is adequately protected once it is
  passed beyond the established information system boundaries. Examples of
  information leaving the system boundary include transmitting information to an
  external information system or printing the information on one of its
  printers. In cases where the information system is unable to make a
  determination of the adequacy of the protections provided by entities outside
  its boundary, as a mitigating control, organizations determine procedurally
  whether the external information systems are providing adequate security. The
  means used to determine the adequacy of the security provided by external
  information systems include, for example, conducting inspections or periodic
  testing, establishing agreements between the organization and its counterpart
  organizations, or some other process. The means used by external entities to
  protect the information received need not be the same as those used by the
  organization, but the means employed are sufficient to provide consistent
  adjudication of the security policy to protect the information. This control
  enhancement requires information systems to employ technical or procedural
  means to validate the information prior to releasing it to external systems.
  For example, if the information system passes information to another system
  controlled by another organization, technical means are employed to validate
  that the security attributes associated with the exported information are
  appropriate for the receiving system. Alternatively, if the information system
  passes information to a printer in organization-controlled space, procedural
  means can be employed to ensure that only appropriately authorized individuals
  gain access to the printer. This control enhancement is most applicable when
  there is some policy mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order, directive, or
  regulation) that establishes policy regarding access to the information, and
  that policy applies beyond the realm of a particular information system or
  organization.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing access
  enforcement; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; list of security
  safeguards provided by receiving information system or system components; list
  of security safeguards validating appropriateness of information designated
  for release; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with access enforcement
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing access enforcement
  functions].

cci-definition: "002180: The organization defines the security safeguards the
  organization-defined information system or system component is to provide to
  protect information released outside the established system boundary."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the security
  safeguards the organization-defined information system or system component is
  to provide to protect information released outside the established system
  boundary. DoD has determined the security safeguards are not appropriate to
  define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation which defines the security safeguards the
  organization-defined information system or system component is to provide to
  protect information released outside the established system boundary.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented security safeguards to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed defines the security safeguards the
  organization-defined information system or system component is to provide to
  protect information released outside the established system boundary. DoD has
  determined the security safeguards are not appropriate to define at the
  Enterprise level.

test-results: UDS integrates multiple security technologies to ensure the secure
  release of information beyond the system boundary. Istio enforces mutual TLS
  (mTLS) across all service-to-service communications, ensuring data in transit
  remains encrypted and authenticated, while also providing fine-grained traffic
  control through ingress and egress gateways to restrict unauthorized data
  flows. Keycloak serves as the identity and access management (IAM) solution,
  implementing OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC), and SAML-based authentication
  to enforce access policies for external data exchanges. NeuVector provides
  deep packet inspection (DPI) and runtime security enforcement, detecting
  unauthorized data egress through application-layer firewalls and behavioral
  anomaly detection. Additionally, Vector and Loki aggregate and analyze system
  logs, enabling real-time monitoring of outbound data transfers and integration
  with SIEM solutions for automated threat detection and response. These
  technologies collectively enforce security controls such as encryption,
  authentication, monitoring, and anomaly detection to mitigate unauthorized
  data disclosures.
