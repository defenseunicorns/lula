  Description:

  The organization only permits the use of shared/group accounts that meet
  [Assignment: organization-defined conditions for establishing shared/group
  accounts].


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system-generated list of
  shared/group accounts and associated role; information system audit records;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing management of
  shared/group accounts].

cci-definition: "002141: The organization only permits the use of shared/group
  accounts that meet organization-defined conditions for establishing
  shared/group accounts."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed only permits the use of shared/group
  accounts that meet the conditions for establishing shared/group accounts
  defined in AC-2 (9), CCI 2140.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation that defines the requirements of creating a
  shared/group account.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the shared/group accounts to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed only permits the use of shared/group accounts that meet the
  conditions for establishing shared/group accounts defined in AC-2 (9), CCI
  2140.
inherited: Local
remote-inheritance-instance: "-"
test-results: Not applicable to UDS technology stack. (It should be an
  organizational decision on if shared/group accounts are required. It is best
  practice to avoid the use of shared/group accounts in most scenarios.)
