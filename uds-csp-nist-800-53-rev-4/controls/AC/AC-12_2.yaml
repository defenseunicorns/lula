control-acronym: AC-12
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system automatically terminates a user session after
  [Assignment: organization-defined conditions or trigger events requiring
  session disconnect].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in
  contrast to SC-10 which addresses the termination of network connections that
  are associated with communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect). A
  logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever
  a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational
  information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate
  user access) without terminating network sessions. Session termination
  terminates all processes associated with a user's logical session except those
  processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to
  continue after the session is terminated. Conditions or trigger events
  requiring automatic session termination can include, for example,
  organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain
  types of incidents, time-of-day restrictions on information system use.
  Related controls: SC-10, SC-23.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing session
  termination; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; list of conditions or
  trigger events requiring session disconnect; information system audit records;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing user session
  termination].

cci-definition: "002361: The information system automatically terminates a user
  session after organization-defined conditions or trigger events requiring
  session disconnect."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  automatically terminate a user session after conditions or trigger events
  requiring session disconnect, as defined in AC-12, CCI 2360. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  2361.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan (SSP)

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks

  3.)
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to automatically
  terminate a user session after conditions or trigger events requiring session
  disconnect, as defined in AC-12, CCI 2360. For information system components
  that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 2361.

test-results: "UDS supports reliable session termination. When a user logs out
  of an application (or out of Keycloak), Keycloakâs single sign-out
  functionality ends the userâs session for all client applications logged in
  via that token. This ensures that all associated sessions are invalidated upon
  user logoutâ. Also, sessions are terminated when their allotted time expires
  (as configured). On the administrative side, an admin can explicitly revoke a
  userâs sessions in Keycloak at any time (for example, if a user is suspected
  compromised, an admin can force-log-out that account from all services). In
  the service mesh, if a token is no longer valid, AuthService will reject
  further requests with that token. Thus, whether the session ends normally
  (user logout) or abnormally (token expiration or manual revocation), UDS
  cleanly terminates the session and prevents further use of those credentials.
  This behavior satisfies the requirement for session termination."
