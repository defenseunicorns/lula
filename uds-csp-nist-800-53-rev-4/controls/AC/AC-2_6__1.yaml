  Description:

  The information system implements the following dynamic privilege management
  capabilities: [Assignment: organization-defined list of dynamic privilege
  management capabilities].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  In contrast to conventional access control approaches which employ static
  information system accounts and predefined sets of user privileges, dynamic
  access control approaches (e.g., service-oriented architectures) rely on run
  time access control decisions facilitated by dynamic privilege management.
  While user identities may remain relatively constant over time, user
  privileges may change more frequently based on ongoing mission/business
  requirements and operational needs of organizations. Dynamic privilege
  management can include, for example, the immediate revocation of privileges
  from users, as opposed to requiring that users terminate and restart their
  sessions to reflect any changes in privileges. Dynamic privilege management
  can also refer to mechanisms that change the privileges of users based on
  dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. This type of
  privilege management includes, for example, automatic adjustments of
  privileges if users are operating out of their normal work times, or if
  information systems are under duress or in emergency maintenance situations.
  This control enhancement also includes the ancillary effects of privilege
  changes, for example, the potential changes to encryption keys used for
  communications. Dynamic privilege management can support requirements for
  information system resiliency. Related control: AC-16.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account
  management; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; system-generated list of
  dynamic privilege management capabilities; information system audit records;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with account management
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Information system implementing dynamic privilege
  management capabilities].

cci-definition: "002134: The organization defines a list of dynamic privilege
  management capabilities to be implemented by the information system."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents a list of
  dynamic privilege management capabilities to be implemented by the information
  system. DoD has determined the list is not appropriate to define at the
  Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated documentation that lists the dynamic privilege management
  capabilities to be implemented by the information system.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented list to ensure the dynamic privilege
  management capabilities have been defined. DoD has determined the list is not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

test-results: Keycloak supports dynamic privilege management by allowing
  privilege revocation via the Admin REST API or Admin Console, which then
  requires active sessions to be revoked or reauthenticated to reflect new
  permissions. It offers fine-grained access control through Authorization
  Services, enabling dynamic policies based on attributes, environment, and user
  behavior, and supports context-aware access via conditional authentication and
  authentication flows. Real-time privilege adjustments without session
  termination would require a custom event listeners and short-lived tokens.
