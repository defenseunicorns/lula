control-acronym: AC-5
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Separates [Assignment: organization-defined duties of individuals];

  b. Documents separation of duties of individuals; and

  c. Defines information system access authorizations to support separation of
  duties.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized
  privileges and helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without
  collusion. Separation of duties includes, for example: (i) dividing mission
  functions and information system support functions among different individuals
  and/or roles; (ii) conducting information system support functions with
  different individuals (e.g., system management, programming, configuration
  management, quality assurance and testing, and network security); and (iii)
  ensuring security personnel administering access control functions do not also
  administer audit functions. Related controls: AC-3, AC-6, PE-3, PE-4, PS-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing divisions
  of responsibility and separation of duties; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; list of divisions of responsibility and
  separation of duties; information system access authorizations; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  defining appropriate divisions of responsibility and separation of duties;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing separation of duties
  policy].

cci: 2220
cci-definition: "002220: The organization defines information system access
  authorizations to support separation of duties."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the
  information system access authorizations to support separation of duties.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated access control policy

  2.) Job description documentation

  3.) Signed and dated documentation that defines the information system access
  authorizations to support separation of duties.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented information system access authorizations
  to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed defines information system
  access authorizations to support separation of duties.

test-results: UDS supports separation of duties through its role-based access
  controls. Different administrator roles can be defined in Keycloak (for
  example, one role for system administration, another for auditing) so no
  single user has unrestricted control without oversight. Kubernetes also uses
  Role-Based Access Control such that duties (like application deployment vs.
  security configuration) can be separated to different service accounts or
  users. This ensures that critical functions require collaboration (or at least
  distinct privileged accounts), aligning with AC-5. (Ultimately, assignment of
  roles to personnel is an organizational task, but the UDS stack provides the
  technical capability to enforce those distinct roles.)
