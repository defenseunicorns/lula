control-acronym: AC-5
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Separates [Assignment: organization-defined duties of individuals];

  b. Documents separation of duties of individuals; and

  c. Defines information system access authorizations to support separation of
  duties.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized
  privileges and helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without
  collusion. Separation of duties includes, for example: (i) dividing mission
  functions and information system support functions among different individuals
  and/or roles; (ii) conducting information system support functions with
  different individuals (e.g., system management, programming, configuration
  management, quality assurance and testing, and network security); and (iii)
  ensuring security personnel administering access control functions do not also
  administer audit functions. Related controls: AC-3, AC-6, PE-3, PE-4, PS-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing divisions
  of responsibility and separation of duties; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; list of divisions of responsibility and
  separation of duties; information system access authorizations; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  defining appropriate divisions of responsibility and separation of duties;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing separation of duties
  policy].

  The organization being inspected/assessed documents separation of duties of
  individuals.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated access control policy

  2.) Job description documentation

  3.) Signed and dated documentation that define the separation of duties of
  individuals
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented separation of duties to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed documents separation of duties of
  individuals.

test-results: UDS provides technical capabilities to enforce documented
  organizational requirements for separation of duties through its integrated
  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) mechanisms. Specifically, Keycloak supports
  clearly defined and documented administrator roles such as system
  administration, security auditing, and application management ensuring
  responsibilities are explicitly separated and documented in accordance with
  organizational policies. Additionally, Kubernetes RBAC provides granular
  control to clearly document and enforce the distinct responsibilities of
  personnel or service accounts related to system management, application
  deployment, and security configuration. Istio Service Mesh further complements
  this by enabling documented traffic management policies, clearly
  distinguishing administrative functions from operational user traffic.
