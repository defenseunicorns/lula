control-acronym: AC-10
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system limits the number of concurrent sessions for each
  [Assignment: organization-defined account and/or account type] to [Assignment:
  organization-defined number].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations may define the maximum number of concurrent sessions for
  information system accounts globally, by account type (e.g., privileged user,
  non-privileged user, domain, specific application), by account, or a
  combination. For example, organizations may limit the number of concurrent
  sessions for system administrators or individuals working in particularly
  sensitive domains or mission-critical applications. This control addresses
  concurrent sessions for information system accounts and does not address
  concurrent sessions by single users via multiple system accounts.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing concurrent
  session control; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing access control policy
  for concurrent session control].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  limit the number of concurrent sessions for all accounts and/or account types
  to a number of sessions defined in AC-10, CCI 55. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  54. DoD has defined the account types and/or accounts as all account types
  and/or accounts.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to limit the number of
  concurrent sessions for all accounts and/or account types to a number of
  sessions defined in AC-10, CCI 55. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 54. DoD has defined the
  account types and/or accounts as all account types and/or accounts.

test-results: "UDS effectively limits the number of concurrent user sessions
  through its centralized identity management solution, Keycloak. Administrators
  explicitly configure this in the Keycloak administrative interface by
  navigating to Authentication â Sessions â Realm Sessions and setting the
  \"Session Limits\" parameters, specifically the \"Max Sessions\" field. These
  settings allow the enforcement of maximum concurrent session limits per
  individual user or defined account types, aligning precisely with
  organizational policy. Once configured, Keycloak automatically enforces these
  session constraints by terminating or preventing additional sessions beyond
  the defined limit."
