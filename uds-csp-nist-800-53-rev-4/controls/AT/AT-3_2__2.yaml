  Description:

  The organization provides [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
  roles] with initial and [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] training
  in the employment and operation of physical security controls.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Physical security controls include, for example, physical access control
  devices, physical intrusion alarms, monitoring/surveillance equipment, and
  security guards (deployment and operating procedures). Organizations identify
  personnel with specific roles and responsibilities associated with physical
  security controls requiring specialized training. Related controls: PE-2,
  PE-3, PE-4, PE-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  addressing security training implementation; security training curriculum;
  security training materials; security plan; training records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  role-based security training; organizational personnel with responsibilities
  for employing and operating physical security controls].
