  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Documents and monitors individual information system security training
  activities including basic security awareness training and specific
  information system security training; and

  b. Retains individual training records for [Assignment: organization-defined
  time period].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Documentation for specialized training may be maintained by individual

  PM-14.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
