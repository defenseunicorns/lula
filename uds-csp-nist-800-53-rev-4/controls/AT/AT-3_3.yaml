control-acronym: AT-3
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization provides role-based security training to personnel with
  assigned security roles and responsibilities:

  a. Before authorizing access to the information system or performing assigned
  duties;

  b. When required by information system changes; and

  c. [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] thereafter.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations determine the appropriate content of security training based on
  the assigned roles and responsibilities of individuals and the specific
  security requirements of organizations and the information systems to which
  personnel have authorized access. In addition, organizations provide
  enterprise architects, information system developers, software developers,
  acquisition/procurement officials, information system managers, system/network
  administrators, personnel conducting configuration management and auditing
  activities, personnel performing independent verification and validation
  activities, security control assessors, and other personnel having access to
  system-level software, adequate security-related technical training
  specifically tailored for their assigned duties. Comprehensive role-based
  training addresses management, operational, and technical roles and
  responsibilities covering physical, personnel, and technical safeguards and
  countermeasures. Such training can include for example, policies, procedures,
  tools, and artifacts for the organizational security roles defined.
  Organizations also provide the training necessary for individuals to carry out
  their responsibilities related to operations and supply chain security within
  the context of organizational information security programs. Role-based
  security training also applies to contractors providing services to federal
  agencies. Related controls: AT-2, AT-4, PL-4, PS-7, SA-3, SA-12, SA-16.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Security awareness and training policy; procedures
  addressing security training implementation; codes of federal regulations;
  security training curriculum; security training materials; security plan;
  training records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  role-based security training; organizational personnel with assigned
  information system security roles and responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms managing role-based security
  training].
