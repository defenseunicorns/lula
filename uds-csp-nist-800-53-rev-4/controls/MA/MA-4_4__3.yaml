control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization protects nonlocal maintenance sessions by:

  (a) Employing [Assignment: organization-defined authenticators that are replay
  resistant]; and

  (b) Separating the maintenance sessions from other network sessions with the
  information system by either:

  (1) Physically separated communications paths; or

  (2) Logically separated communications paths based upon encryption.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related control: SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system maintenance policy; procedures
  addressing nonlocal information system maintenance; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; maintenance records; audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  maintenance responsibilities; network engineers; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for protecting nonlocal
  maintenance sessions; automated mechanisms implementing replay resistant
  authenticators; automated mechanisms implementing logically
  separated/encrypted communications paths].

cci-definition: "001632: The organization protects nonlocal maintenance sessions
  by separating the maintenance session from other network sessions with the
  information system by either physically separated communications paths or
  logically separated communications paths based upon encryption."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  protect nonlocal maintenance sessions by separating the maintenance session
  from other network sessions with the information system by either physically
  separated communications paths or logically separated communications paths
  based upon encryption. For information system components that have applicable
  STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the
  STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 1632.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Policy or procedure that details how remote maintenance and digital
  sessions are separated from other network sessions
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to protect nonlocal
  maintenance sessions by separating the maintenance session from other network
  sessions with the information system by either physically separated
  communications paths or logically separated communications paths based upon
  encryption. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the
  components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 1632.
