control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Requires the approval of each nonlocal maintenance session by [Assignment:
  organization-defined personnel or roles]; and

  (b) Notifies [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] of the date
  and time of planned nonlocal maintenance.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Notification may be performed by maintenance personnel. Approval of nonlocal
  maintenance sessions is accomplished by organizational personnel with
  sufficient information security and information system knowledge to determine
  the appropriateness of the proposed maintenance.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system maintenance policy; procedures
  addressing non-local information system maintenance; security plan;
  notifications supporting nonlocal maintenance sessions; maintenance records;
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  maintenance responsibilities; organizational personnel with notification
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with approval responsibilities;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for approving and notifying
  personnel regarding nonlocal maintenance; automated mechanisms supporting
  notification and approval of nonlocal maintenance].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to notify the user base which could be impacted by the maintenance event of
  the date and time of planned nonlocal maintenance. DoD has defined the
  personnel or roles as the user base which could be impacted by the maintenance
  event.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation that proves that required personnel have been notified of
  the date and time of remote maintenance
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed notifies the user base which could be impacted by the
  maintenance event of the date and time of planned nonlocal maintenance. DoD
  has defined the personnel or roles as the user base which could be impacted by
  the maintenance event.

  considered local maintenance as admins would either be provided by the
  organization or contracted.)
