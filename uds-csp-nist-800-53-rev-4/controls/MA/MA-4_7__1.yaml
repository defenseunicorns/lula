control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system implements remote disconnect verification at the
  termination of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Remote disconnect verification ensures that remote connections from nonlocal
  maintenance sessions have been terminated and are no longer available for use.
  Related control: SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system maintenance policy; procedures
  addressing non-local information system maintenance; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; cryptographic mechanisms protecting nonlocal maintenance
  activities; maintenance records; diagnostic records; audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  maintenance responsibilities; network engineers; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing remote disconnect
  verifications of terminated nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions].

  sessions."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  implement remote disconnect verification at the termination of nonlocal
  maintenance and diagnostic sessions. For information system components that
  have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 2891.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation that details how remote session disconnects are verified
  once remote session is terminated.

  2.) Screen shots, if possible
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to implement remote
  disconnect verification at the termination of nonlocal maintenance and
  diagnostic sessions. For information system components that have applicable
  STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates
  the components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 2891.
