control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs a wireless intrusion detection system to identify
  rogue wireless devices and to detect attack attempts and potential
  compromises/breaches to the information system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Wireless signals may radiate beyond the confines of organization-controlled
  facilities. Organizations proactively search for unauthorized wireless
  connections including the conduct of thorough scans for unauthorized wireless
  access points. Scans are not limited to those areas within facilities
  containing information systems, but also include areas outside of facilities
  as needed, to verify that unauthorized wireless access points are not
  connected to the systems. Related controls: AC-18, IA-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing information system monitoring tools and techniques; information
  system design documentation; information system monitoring tools and
  techniques documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; information system protocols; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility for monitoring the information
  system; organizational personnel with responsibility for the intrusion
  detection system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for intrusion detection;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing wireless intrusion
  detection capability].

  potential compromises/breaches to the information system."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a wireless
  intrusion detection system to identify rogue wireless devices and to detect
  attack attempts and potential compromises/breaches to the information system.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan reference to section pertaining to a
  wireless intrusion detection system to identify rogue wireless devices and to
  detect attack attempts and potential compromises/breaches to the information
  system.

  2.) Log of wireless intrusion detection system.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines documentation of the use of the identified wireless
  intrusion detection system and the system hardware/software list to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed employs a wireless intrusion detection
  system to identify rogue wireless devices and to detect attack attempts and
  potential compromises/breaches to the information system. The organization
  being inspected/assessed may be required to demonstrate use of the wireless
  intrusion detection system.
