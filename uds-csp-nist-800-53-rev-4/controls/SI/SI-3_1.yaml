control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Employs malicious code protection mechanisms at information system entry
  and exit points to detect and eradicate malicious code;

  b. Updates malicious code protection mechanisms whenever new releases are
  available in accordance with organizational configuration management policy
  and procedures;

  c. Configures malicious code protection mechanisms to:

  1. Perform periodic scans of the information system [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] and real-time scans of files from external
  sources at [Selection (one or more): endpoint; network entry/exit points] as
  the files are downloaded, opened, or executed in accordance with
  organizational security policy; and

  2. [Selection (one or more): block malicious code; quarantine malicious code;
  send alert to administrator; [Assignment: organization-defined action]] in
  response to malicious code detection; and

  d. Addresses the receipt of false positives during malicious code detection
  and eradication and the resulting potential impact on the availability of the
  information system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information system entry and exit points include, for example, firewalls,
  electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, remote-access servers,
  workstations, notebook computers, and mobile devices. Malicious code includes,
  for example, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can
  also be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode), contained within
  compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using steganography. Malicious
  code can be transported by different means including, for example, web
  accesses, electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable storage
  devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of
  information system vulnerabilities. Malicious code protection mechanisms
  include, for example, anti-virus signature definitions and reputation-based
  technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or
  eliminate the effects of malicious code. Pervasive configuration management
  and comprehensive software integrity controls may be effective in preventing
  execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf
  software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This
  could include, for example, logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber
  attacks that could affect organizational missions/business functions.
  Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always detect such
  code. In these situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards
  including, for example, secure coding practices, configuration management and
  control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices to help
  ensure that software does not perform functions other than the functions
  intended. Organizations may determine that in response to the detection of
  malicious code, different actions may be warranted. For example, organizations
  can define actions in response to malicious code detection during periodic
  scans, actions in response to detection of malicious downloads, and/or actions
  in response to detection of maliciousness when attempting to open or execute
  files. Related controls: CM-3, MP-2, SA-4, SA-8, SA-12, SA-13, SC-7, SC-26,
  SC-44, SI-2, SI-4, SI-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; configuration
  management policy and procedures; procedures addressing malicious code
  protection; malicious code protection mechanisms; records of malicious code
  protection updates; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; scan results from
  malicious code protection mechanisms; record of actions initiated by malicious
  code protection mechanisms in response to malicious code detection;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility for malicious code protection;
  organizational personnel with configuration management responsibility].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for employing, updating, and
  configuring malicious code protection mechanisms; organizational process for
  addressing false positives and resulting potential impact; automated
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing employing, updating, and configuring
  malicious code protection mechanisms; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing malicious code scanning and subsequent actions].

cci-definition: "002619: The organization employs malicious code protection
  mechanisms at information system entry points to detect malicious code."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed identifies and documents the
  information system entry points and implements malicious code protection
  mechanisms at those entry points to detect malicious code. Information system
  entry and exit points include, for example, firewalls, electronic mail
  servers, web servers, proxy servers, remote-access servers, workstations,
  notebook computers, and mobile devices. Malicious code protection mechanisms
  include, for example, anti-virus signature definitions and reputation-based
  technologies.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan that documents all entry points for
  information system (Reviewer [Scan/Network] will confirm actual entry points
  match documentation) and malicious code protections being used, as well as
  frequency by which protection signatures are updated (Reviewer [Network/HBSS]
  will validate that protections are being used and signatures are current).
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system architecture as well as the organization's
  documentation of information system entry points and verifies that malicious
  code protection mechanisms are implemented.
