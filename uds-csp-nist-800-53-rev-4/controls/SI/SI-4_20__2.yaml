  Description:

  The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined additional
  monitoring] of privileged users.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing information system monitoring tools and techniques; information
  system design documentation; list of privileged users; information system
  monitoring tools and techniques documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; information system
  monitoring logs or records; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility for monitoring the information
  system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for information system
  monitoring; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing system
  monitoring capability].

cci-definition: "002677: The organization implements organization-defined
  additional monitoring of privileged users."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed implements additional monitoring
  defined in SI-4 (20), CCI 2676 of privileged users. The organization must
  maintain an audit trail of additional monitoring.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Audit trail of additional monitoring defined in SI-4 (20), CCI 2676 of
  privileged users (located in Site's SSP).
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the audit trail of additional monitoring to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed implements additional monitoring defined
  in SI-4 (20), CCI 2676 of privileged users.

compliance-status: Compliant
test-results: UDS implements robust monitoring of privileged user activities
  through its integrated logging and security components. Privileged actions
  performed in Keycloak (e.g., account creation, modification, disabling, or
  deletion) and administrative activities in Kubernetes are logged
  comprehensively and aggregated centrally via Vector and Loki, with detailed
  records including user identities, timestamps, actions performed, and source
  IP addresses.
