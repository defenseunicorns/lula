  Description:

  The organization makes provisions so that [Assignment: organization-defined
  encrypted communications traffic] is visible to [Assignment:
  organization-defined information system monitoring tools].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations balance the potentially conflicting needs for encrypting
  communications traffic and for having insight into such traffic from a
  monitoring perspective. For some organizations, the need to ensure the
  confidentiality of communications traffic is paramount; for others,
  mission-assurance is of greater concern. Organizations determine whether the
  visibility requirement applies to internal encrypted traffic, encrypted
  traffic intended for external destinations, or a subset of the traffic types.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing information system monitoring tools and techniques; information
  system design documentation; information system monitoring tools and
  techniques documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; information system protocols; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility for monitoring the information
  system; organizational personnel with responsibility for the intrusion
  detection system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for intrusion
  detection/information system monitoring; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing intrusion detection/information system monitoring
  capability; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing visibility of
  encrypted communications traffic to monitoring tools].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed makes provisions so that encrypted
  communications traffic defined in SI-4 (10), CCI 2665 is visible to
  information system monitoring tools defined in SI-4 (10), CCI 2666.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Information system Architecture documentation.

  2.) Configuration documentation for information system architecture so
  encrypted communications traffic is visible to information system monitoring
  tools defined in SI-4 (10), CCI 2666.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system architecture to verify that the encrypted
  communications traffic is visible to information system monitoring tools
  defined in SI-4 (10), CCI 2666.
