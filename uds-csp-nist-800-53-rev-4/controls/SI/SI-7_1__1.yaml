control-acronym: SI-7(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system performs an integrity check of [Assignment:
  organization-defined software, firmware, and information] [Selection (one or
  more): at startup; at [Assignment: organization-defined transitional states or
  security-relevant events]; [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Security-relevant events include, for example, the identification of a new
  threat to which organizational information systems are susceptible, and the
  installation of new hardware, software, or firmware. Transitional states
  include, for example, system startup, restart, shutdown, and abort.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing software, firmware, and information integrity; information system
  design documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; integrity verification tools and associated documentation;
  records of integrity scans; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  software, firmware, and/or information integrity; organizational personnel
  with information security responsibilities; system/network administrators;
  system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Software, firmware, and information integrity verification
  tools].

cci: 2705
cci-definition: "002705: The organization defines the software on which
  integrity checks will be performed."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the software
  on which integrity checks will be performed. DoD has determined the software
  is not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System security plan defines the software which will be
  subjected to integrity verification tools to check for unauthorized changes.

  2.) Implementation documentation of integrity verification tools that will
  check the firmware for unauthorized changes.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented software to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed defines the firmware on which integrity checks will be
  performed. DoD has determined the software is not appropriate to define at the
  Enterprise level.

test-results: "UDS provides inherent capabilities to support integrity checking
  through its containerized deployment model and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
  practices. Specifically, all deployed software components within UDS including
  Keycloak, Istio, and core Kubernetes resources are packaged and distributed
  via signed and version-controlled Zarf packages, which inherently include
  cryptographic hashes to verify software integrity prior to deployment.
  Thereâs confidence the code running is exactly what was published by the
  provider. Configuration Integrity is done through Pepr policies enforce that
  Kubernetes resources maintain expected settings (e.g., images with known good
  digests, certain labels present). If someone tried to deploy an unapproved
  image, the admission controller would reject it. All communications are
  integrity-protected (per SC-8) and data at rest can be encrypted (SC-28).
  Also, version control of IaC means any config change is tracked. UDS ensures
  that the systemâs software and information cannot be altered undetectably.
  If an unauthorized change occurs, it will either be prevented or
  logged/alerted."
