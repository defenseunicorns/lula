  Description:

  The organization implements [Assignment: organization-defined host-based
  monitoring mechanisms] at [Assignment: organization-defined information system
  components].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information system components where host-based monitoring can be implemented
  include, for example, servers, workstations, and mobile devices. Organizations
  consider employing host-based monitoring mechanisms from multiple information
  technology product developers.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing information system monitoring tools and techniques; information
  system design documentation; host-based monitoring mechanisms; information
  system monitoring tools and techniques documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; list of information
  system components requiring host-based monitoring; information system
  monitoring logs or records; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility for monitoring information system
  hosts].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for information system
  monitoring; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing host-based
  monitoring capability].

  DoD has defined the host-based monitoring mechanisms as HBSS.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:
  Automatically compliant.
assessment-procedures: The organization being inspected/assessed is
  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the host-based monitoring mechanisms as HBSS.

compliance-status: Compliant
test-results: In UDS, host-based monitoring is implemented across each critical
  system component using a combination of telemetry and security agents. The
  Kubernetes Metrics Server gathers host-level performance data such as CPU,
  memory, and disk I/O usage from each node, which Prometheus collects and
  Grafana visualizes for ongoing performance tracking and anomaly detection.
