control-acronym: SI-4(22)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system detects network services that have not been authorized
  or approved by [Assignment: organization-defined authorization or approval
  processes] and [Selection (one or more): audits; alerts [Assignment:
  organization-defined personnel or roles]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Unauthorized or unapproved network services include, for example, services in
  service-oriented architectures that lack organizational verification or
  validation and therefore may be unreliable or serve as malicious rogues for
  valid services. Related controls: AC-6, CM-7, SA-5, SA-9.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing information system monitoring tools and techniques; information
  system design documentation; information system monitoring tools and
  techniques documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; documented authorization/approval of network
  services; notifications or alerts of unauthorized network services;
  information system monitoring logs or records; information system audit
  records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developer;
  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the
  information system; organizational personnel with responsibility for
  monitoring the information system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for information system
  monitoring; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing system
  monitoring capability; automated mechanisms for auditing network services;
  automated mechanisms for providing alerts].
