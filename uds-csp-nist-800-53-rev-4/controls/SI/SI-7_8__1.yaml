control-acronym: SI-7(8)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system, upon detection of a potential integrity violation,
  provides the capability to audit the event and initiates the following
  actions: [Selection (one or more): generates an audit record; alerts current
  user; alerts [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles];
  [Assignment: organization-defined other actions]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations select response actions based on types of software, specific
  software, or information for which there are potential integrity violations.
  Related controls: AU-2, AU-6, AU-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing software, firmware, and information integrity; information system
  design documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; integrity verification tools and associated documentation;
  records of integrity scans; incident response records, list of
  security-relevant changes to the information system; automated tools
  supporting alerts and notifications if unauthorized security changes are
  detected; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  software, firmware, and/or information integrity; organizational personnel
  with information security responsibilities; system/network administrators;
  system developer].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Software, firmware, and information integrity verification
  tools; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing the capability to
  audit potential integrity violations; automated mechanisms supporting and/or
  implementing alerts about potential integrity violations].
