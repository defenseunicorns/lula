control-acronym: SI-3(10)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Employs [Assignment: organization-defined tools and techniques] to analyze
  the characteristics and behavior of malicious code; and

  (b) Incorporates the results from malicious code analysis into organizational
  incident response and flaw remediation processes.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The application of selected malicious code analysis tools and techniques
  provides organizations with a more in-depth understanding of adversary
  tradecraft (i.e., tactics, techniques, and procedures) and the functionality
  and purpose of specific instances of malicious code. Understanding the
  characteristics of malicious code facilitates more effective organizational
  responses to current and future threats. Organizations can conduct malicious
  code analyses by using reverse engineering techniques or by monitoring the
  behavior of executing code.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing malicious code protection; procedures addressing incident response;
  procedures addressing flaw remediation; information system design
  documentation; malicious code protection mechanisms, tools, and techniques;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  results from malicious code analyses; records of flaw remediation events
  resulting from malicious code analyses; information system audit records;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility for malicious code protection;
  organizational personnel responsible for flaw remediation; organizational
  personnel responsible for incident response/management].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational process for incident response;
  organizational process for flaw remediation; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing malicious code protection capability; tools and techniques
  for analysis of malicious code characteristics and behavior].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements techniques
  defined in SI-3 (10), CCI 2635 to analyze the characteristics and behavior of
  malicious code.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Implementation documentation of techniques defined in SI-3 (10), CCI 2635
  to analyze the characteristics and behavior of malicious code.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented techniques to ensure the organization
  being inspected/assessed employs techniques defined in SI-3 (10), CCI 2635 to
  analyze the characteristics and behavior of malicious code.
