  Description:

  The organization centrally manages the flaw remediation process.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Central management is the organization-wide management and implementation of
  flaw remediation processes. Central management includes planning,
  implementing, assessing, authorizing, and monitoring the organization-defined,
  centrally managed flaw remediation security controls.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing flaw remediation; automated mechanisms supporting centralized
  management of flaw remediation; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility for flaw remediation].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for central management of the
  flaw remediation process; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  central management of the flaw remediation process].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to centrally manage the flaw remediation process.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated continuous monitoring plan.

  2.) Reference to continuous monitoring plan section that manages the flaw
  remediation process.

  3.) Screenshot or sample of flaw remediation process.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed centrally manages the flaw remediation process.

  organizational level as there might be configuration management outside the
