  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Receives information system security alerts, advisories, and directives
  from [Assignment: organization-defined external organizations] on an ongoing
  basis;

  b. Generates internal security alerts, advisories, and directives as deemed
  necessary;

  c. Disseminates security alerts, advisories, and directives to: [Selection
  (one or more): [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles];
  [Assignment: organization-defined elements within the organization];
  [Assignment: organization-defined external organizations]]; and

  d. Implements security directives in accordance with established time frames,
  or notifies the issuing organization of the degree of noncompliance.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) generates
  security alerts and advisories to maintain situational awareness across the
  federal government. Security directives are issued by OMB or other designated
  organizations with the responsibility and authority to issue such directives.
  Compliance to security directives is essential due to the critical nature of
  many of these directives and the potential immediate adverse effects on
  organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and
  the Nation should the directives not be implemented in a timely manner.
  External organizations include, for example, external mission/business
  partners, supply chain partners, external service providers, and other
  peer/supporting organizations. Related control: SI-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing security alerts, advisories, and directives; records of security
  alerts and advisories; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security alert and
  advisory responsibilities; organizational personnel implementing, operating,
  maintaining, and using the information system; organizational personnel,
  organizational elements, and/or external organizations to whom alerts,
  advisories, and directives are to be disseminated; system/network
  administrators; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for defining, receiving,
  generating, disseminating, and complying with security alerts, advisories, and
  directives; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing definition,
  receipt, generation, and dissemination of security alerts, advisories, and
  directives; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing security
  directives].

  organization-defined external organizations."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed disseminates security alerts,
  advisories, and directives to the ISSO and ISSM and/or external organizations
  defined in SI-5, CCI 2694. DoD has defined the personnel or roles as the ISSO
  and ISSM.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System security plan documents which organization defined
  personnel and elements are authorized to receive security notifications, as
  well as what external organizations/personnel are authorized to receive them.

  2.) Communication logs.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines any applicable artifacts showing dissemination of
  security alerts, advisories, and directives to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed disseminates security alerts, advisories, and directives to
  the ISSO and ISSM and/or external organizations defined in SI-5, CCI 2694. DoD
  has defined the personnel or roles as the ISSO and ISSM.
