control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs an intrusion detection system to monitor wireless
  communications traffic as the traffic passes from wireless to wireline
  networks.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related control: AC-18.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing information system monitoring tools and techniques; information
  system design documentation; information system monitoring tools and
  techniques documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; information system protocols documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel
  installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the information system;
  organizational personnel with responsibility for monitoring the information
  system; organizational personnel with responsibility for the intrusion
  detection system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for intrusion
  detection/information system monitoring; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing intrusion detection/information system monitoring
  capability; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing wireless
  intrusion detection capability].

cci-definition: "001282: The organization employs an intrusion detection system
  to monitor wireless communications traffic as the traffic passes from wireless
  to wireline networks."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements an
  intrusion detection system to monitor wireless communications traffic as the
  traffic passes from wireless to wireline networks.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan references an intrusion detection
  system to monitor wireless communications traffic as the traffic passes from
  wireless to wireline networks.

  2.) Log of intrusion detection system.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines documentation of the use of the identified intrusion
  detection system to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed employs
  an intrusion detection system to monitor wireless communications traffic as
  the traffic passes from wireless to wireline networks. The organization being
  inspected/assessed may be required to demonstrate use of the intrusion
  detection system.
