control-acronym: SI-4(12)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs automated mechanisms to alert security personnel of
  the following inappropriate or unusual activities with security implications:
  [Assignment: organization-defined activities that trigger alerts].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement focuses on the security alerts generated by
  organizations and transmitted using automated means. In contrast to the alerts
  generated by information systems in SI-4 (5), which tend to focus on
  information sources internal to the systems (e.g., audit records), the sources
  of information for this enhancement can include other entities as well (e.g.,
  suspicious activity reports, reports on potential insider threats). Related
  controls: AC-18, IA-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing information system monitoring tools and techniques; information
  system design documentation; information system monitoring tools and
  techniques documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; list of inappropriate or unusual activities (with
  security implications) that trigger alerts; alerts/notifications provided to
  security personnel; information system monitoring logs or records; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: System/network administrators; organizational
  personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers;
  organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the
  information system; organizational personnel with responsibility for
  monitoring the information system; organizational personnel with
  responsibility for the intrusion detection system].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for intrusion
  detection/information system monitoring; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing intrusion detection/information system monitoring
  capability; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing automated
  alerts to security personnel].

cci-definition: "001274: The organization employs automated mechanisms to alert
  security personnel of an organization-defined inappropriate or unusual
  activities with security implications."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements automated
  mechanisms to alert security personnel when there are threats identified by
  authoritative sources (e.g. CTOs) and IAW with CJCSM 6510.01B. For automated
  alert mechanisms that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  1274. DoD has defined the activities that trigger alerts as when there are
  threats identified by authoritative sources (e.g. CTOs) and IAW with CJCSM
  6510.01B.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan documents automated mechanisms to
  alert security personnel when there are threats identified by authoritative
  sources (e.g. CTOs) and IAW with CJCSM 6510.01B.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks pertaining to CCI 1274.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines documentation of the use of the identified automated
  mechanisms used to alert security personnel when there are threats identified
  by authoritative sources (e.g. CTOs) and IAW with CJCSM 6510.01B. For
  automated alert mechanisms that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 1274. The organization being inspected/assessed may be required to
  demonstrate use of their identified automated mechanisms. DoD has defined the
  activities that trigger alerts as when there are threats identified by
  authoritative sources (e.g. CTOs) and IAW with CJCSM 6510.01B.
