control-acronym: SI-7(7)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization incorporates the detection of unauthorized [Assignment:
  organization-defined security-relevant changes to the information system] into
  the organizational incident response capability.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement helps to ensure that detected events are tracked,
  monitored, corrected, and available for historical purposes. Maintaining
  historical records is important both for being able to identify and discern
  adversary actions over an extended period of time and for possible legal
  actions. Security-relevant changes include, for example, unauthorized changes
  to established configuration settings or unauthorized elevation of information
  system privileges. Related controls: IR-4, IR-5, SI-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures
  addressing software, firmware, and information integrity; procedures
  addressing incident response; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  incident response records; information audit records; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  software, firmware, and/or information integrity; organizational personnel
  with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  incident response responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for incorporating detection of
  unauthorized security-relevant changes into the incident response capability;
  software, firmware, and information integrity verification tools; automated
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing incorporation of detection of
  unauthorized security-relevant changes into the incident response capability].

cci-definition: "002720: The organization incorporates the detection of
  unauthorized organization-defined security-relevant changes to the information
  system into the organizational incident response capability."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed incorporates the detection of
  unauthorized security-relevant changes to the information system defined in
  SI-7 (7), CCI 2719 into the organizational incident response capability.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated System security plan defines which unauthorized
  security-relevant changes will be a part of the organization-level Incident
  Response Plan.

  2.) Organization-level incident response plan in which unauthorized
  security-relevant changes will be a part of the organization-level Incident
  Response Plan.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the organizational incident response capability to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed incorporates the detection of
  unauthorized security-relevant changes to the information system defined in
  SI-7 (7), CCI 2719.

compliance-status: Compliant
test-results: In UDS, unauthorized security-relevant changes are defined as any
  deviations from the approved baseline configuration or software state such as
  unauthorized modifications to container images, configuration files, service
  mesh policies, or authentication settings that could compromise the system's
  security. These changes are identified through continuous monitoring and
  enforcement mechanisms provided by Pepr, NeuVector, and Kubernetes audit logs,
  with additional visibility from Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki. Once such
  deviations are detected, they are flagged as security incidents and integrated
  into the incident response capability, triggering alerts and initiating
  forensic analysis to enable rapid containment and remediation.
