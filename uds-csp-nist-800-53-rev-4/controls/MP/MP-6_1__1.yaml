control-acronym: MP-6(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization reviews, approves, tracks, documents, and verifies media
  sanitization and disposal actions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations review and approve media to be sanitized to ensure compliance
  with records-retention policies. Tracking/documenting actions include, for
  example, listing personnel who reviewed and approved sanitization and disposal
  actions, types of media sanitized, specific files stored on the media,
  sanitization methods used, date and time of the sanitization actions,
  personnel who performed the sanitization, verification actions taken,
  personnel who performed the verification, and disposal action taken.
  Organizations verify that the sanitization of the media was effective prior to
  disposal. Related control: SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system media protection policy; procedures
  addressing media sanitization and disposal; media sanitization and disposal
  records; review records for media sanitization and disposal actions; approvals
  for media sanitization and disposal actions; tracking records; verification
  records; audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  media sanitization and disposal responsibilities; organizational personnel
  with information security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for media sanitization; automated
  mechanisms supporting and/or implementing media sanitization].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, but NOT included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4

cci: 2567
cci-definition: "002567: The organization reviews and approves media sanitization."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  for reviewing and approving media sanitization. The process must include
  procedures for reviewing and approving sanitization actions. The organization
  must maintain a record of media sanitization actions.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) TTP, SOP, or Audit Trail showing documented process and record of
  reviewing media sanitation

  2.) System Security Plan (SSP), if necessary, referencing sections which apply
  to reviewing and record of media sanitation
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process as well as the record of media
  sanitization actions to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  reviews and approves media sanitization actions.
