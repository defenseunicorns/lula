control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization restricts access to [Assignment: organization-defined types
  of digital and/or non-digital media] to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital
  media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable
  hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks.
  Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. Restricting
  non-digital media access includes, for example, denying access to patient
  medical records in a community hospital unless the individuals seeking access
  to such records are authorized healthcare providers. Restricting access to
  digital media includes, for example, limiting access to design specifications
  stored on compact disks in the media library to the project leader and the
  individuals on the development team. Related controls: AC-3, IA-2, MP-4, PE-2,
  PE-3, PL-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system media protection policy; procedures
  addressing media access restrictions; access control policy and procedures;
  physical and environmental protection policy and procedures; media storage
  facilities; access control records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  media protection responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for restricting information
  media; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing media access
  restrictions].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will define and document personnel
  or roles to restrict access to media IAW DoD 5200.01-M, CTO 10-133, and CTO
  08-001. DoD has determined the personnel or roles are not appropriate to
  define at the Enterprise level, but personnel must be identified IAW DoD
  5200.01-M, CTO 10-133, and CTO 08-001.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation to ensure that personnel or roles are defined and access for
  personnel or roles defined are restricted and outlined IAW DoD 5200.01-M, CTO
  10-133, and CTO 08-001.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented personnel or roles to restrict access to
  media to ensure the access is granted IAW DoD 5200.01-M, CTO 10-133, and CTO
  08-001. DoD has determined the personnel or roles are not appropriate to
  define at the Enterprise level, but personnel must be identified IAW DoD
  5200.01-M, CTO 10-133, and CTO 08-001.
