control-acronym: MP-3
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Marks information system media indicating the distribution limitations,
  handling caveats, and applicable security markings (if any) of the
  information; and

  b. Exempts [Assignment: organization-defined types of information system
  media] from marking as long as the media remain within [Assignment:
  organization-defined controlled areas].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The term security marking refers to the application/use of human-readable
  security attributes. The term security labeling refers to the application/use
  of security attributes with regard to internal data structures within
  information systems (see AC-16). Information system media includes both
  digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes, for example, diskettes,
  magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact
  disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper
  and microfilm. Security marking is generally not required for media containing
  information determined by organizations to be in the public domain or to be
  publicly releasable. However, some organizations may require markings for
  public information indicating that the information is publicly releasable.
  Marking of information system media reflects applicable federal laws,
  Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.
  Related controls: AC-16, PL-2, RA-3.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system media protection policy; procedures
  addressing media marking; physical and environmental protection policy and
  procedures; security plan; list of information system media marking security
  attributes; designated controlled areas; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  media protection and marking responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for marking information media;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing media marking].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP
