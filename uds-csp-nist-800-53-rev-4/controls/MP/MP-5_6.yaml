control-acronym: MP-5
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Protects and controls [Assignment: organization-defined types of
  information system media] during transport outside of controlled areas using
  [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards];

  b. Maintains accountability for information system media during transport
  outside of controlled areas;

  c. Documents activities associated with the transport of information system
  media; and

  d. Restricts the activities associated with the transport of information
  system media to authorized personnel.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital
  media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable
  hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks.
  Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. This control
  also applies to mobile devices with information storage capability (e.g.,
  smart phones, tablets, E-readers), that are transported outside of controlled
  areas. Controlled areas are areas or spaces for which organizations provide
  sufficient physical and/or procedural safeguards to meet the requirements
  established for protecting information and/or information systems.


  Physical and technical safeguards for media are commensurate with the security
  category or classification of the information residing on the media.
  Safeguards to protect media during transport include, for example, locked
  containers and cryptography. Cryptographic mechanisms can provide
  confidentiality and integrity protections depending upon the mechanisms used.
  Activities associated with transport include the actual transport as well as
  those activities such as releasing media for transport and ensuring that media
  enters the appropriate transport processes. For the actual transport,
  authorized transport and courier personnel may include individuals from
  outside the organization (e.g., U.S. Postal Service or a commercial transport
  or delivery service). Maintaining accountability of media during transport
  includes, for example, restricting transport activities to authorized
  personnel, and tracking and/or obtaining explicit records of transport
  activities as the media moves through the transportation system to prevent and
  detect loss, destruction, or tampering. Organizations establish documentation
  requirements for activities associated with the transport of information
  system media in accordance with organizational assessments of risk to include
  the flexibility to define different record-keeping methods for the different
  types of media transport as part of an overall system of transport-related
  records. Related controls: AC-19, CP-9, MP-3, MP-4, RA-3, SC-8, SC-13, SC-28.


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: MP-5 (a)
  Requirement: The service provider defines security measures to protect digital
  and non-digital media in transport. The security measures are approved and
  accepted by the JAB.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Information system media protection policy; procedures
  addressing media storage; physical and environmental protection policy and
  procedures; access control policy and procedures; security plan; information
  system media; designated controlled areas; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  media protection and storage responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for storing information media;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing media storage/media
  protection].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.

cci-definition: "001024: The organization restricts the activities associated
  with the transport of information system media to authorized personnel."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed ensures the organization defined
  security measures (MP-2) includes a requirement to develop and maintain a list
  of personnel authorized to transport information system media outside of
  controlled areas, IAW DoDM 5200.01 M Vol. 1-4 and DoDD 5015.2. Develop and
  maintain the list of personnel authorized to transport information system
  media outside of controlled areas.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Policy to ensure that defined security measures include a requirement to
  develop a list of personnel authorized to transport information system media
  outside controlled areas.

  2.) List of personnel authorized to transport information system media outside
  of controlled areas.

  3.) Training documentation for personnel on the guidelines of transporting
  information system media.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the list of personnel authorized to transport information
  system media outside of controlled areas. Organizational personnel with
  information system media transport responsibilities and security management
  personnel are to be interviewed. The purpose of the reviews and reviews is to
  determine if the organization has established restrictions associated with the
  transport of information system media to authorized personnel only.
