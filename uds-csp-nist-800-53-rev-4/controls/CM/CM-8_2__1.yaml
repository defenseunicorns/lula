control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs automated mechanisms to help maintain an up-to-date,
  complete, accurate, and readily available inventory of information system
  components.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations maintain information system inventories to the extent feasible.
  Virtual machines, for example, can be difficult to monitor because such
  machines are not visible to the network when not in use. In such cases,
  organizations maintain as up-to-date, complete, and accurate an inventory as
  is deemed reasonable. This control enhancement can be satisfied by the
  implementation of CM-2 (2) for organizations that choose to combine
  information system component inventory and baseline configuration activities.
  Related control: SI-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; configuration
  management plan; procedures addressing information system component inventory;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; information system inventory records;
  change control records; information system maintenance records; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  managing the automated mechanisms implementing the information system
  component inventory; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for maintaining the inventory of
  information system components; automated mechanisms implementing the
  information system component inventory].

  maintain an up-to-date inventory of information system components."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements automated
  mechanisms to help maintain an up-to-date inventory of information system
  components. An automated mechanism implemented IAW CM-2 (2) satisfies the
  requirements of this CCI if the automated mechanism maintains an up-to-date
  inventory.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation that identifies and defines a process for implementing
  automated mechanisms to help maintain an up-to-date inventory of information
  system components
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documentation identifying the automated mechanism
  used to help maintain an up-to-date inventory of information system components
  and examines the mechanism to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed
  employs automated mechanisms to help maintain an up-to-date inventory of
  information system components.

test-results: UDS employs automated mechanisms to maintain an up-to-date and
  accurate inventory of information system components. Specifically, UDS
  leverages Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using OpenTofu and deployment
  automation with secure Zarf packages to maintain precise, documented
  inventories of all deployed infrastructure, containers, and applications.
