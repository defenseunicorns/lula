  Description:

  The organization reviews and updates the baseline configuration of the
  information system:

  (a) [Assignment: organization-defined frequency];

  (b) When required due to [Assignment organization-defined circumstances]; and

  (c) As an integral part of information system component installations and
  upgrades.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related control: CM-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; configuration
  management plan; procedures addressing the baseline configuration of the
  information system; procedures addressing information system component
  installations and upgrades; information system architecture and configuration
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; records of information system baseline configuration reviews
  and updates; information system component installations/upgrades and
  associated records; change control records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing baseline
  configurations; automated mechanisms supporting review and update of the
  baseline configuration].

cci-definition: "000296: The organization reviews and updates the baseline
  configuration of the information system at an organization-defined frequency."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed reviews and updates the baseline
  configuration of the information system annually. The organization must
  document each occurrence of the reviews and update actions as an audit trail.
  DoD has defined the frequency as annually.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Baseline configuration of the information system (hardware and software
  list) with change log referenced
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines documentation of organizational reviews and update
  actions for the baseline configuration to ensure annual review and necessary
  updates are occurring. DoD has defined the frequency as annually.

compliance-status: Compliant
test-results: UDS provides strong technical support for annual reviews and
  updates of the baseline configuration through its Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
  approach using OpenTofu and secure deployment with signed Zarf packages. These
  tools inherently facilitate the version-controlled documentation of software
  and infrastructure components, clearly recording baseline configurations,
  hardware, software versions, and dependencies. Additionally, UDS generates
  Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) to document and test the baseline
  configuration, ensuring that all components are accounted for and properly
  configured. Since UDS is updated frequently organizations are compliant with
  the DoD has defined the frequency as annually.
