  Description:

  The organization reviews and updates the baseline configuration of the
  information system:

  (a) [Assignment: organization-defined frequency];

  (b) When required due to [Assignment organization-defined circumstances]; and

  (c) As an integral part of information system component installations and
  upgrades.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related control: CM-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; configuration
  management plan; procedures addressing the baseline configuration of the
  information system; procedures addressing information system component
  installations and upgrades; information system architecture and configuration
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; records of information system baseline configuration reviews
  and updates; information system component installations/upgrades and
  associated records; change control records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing baseline
  configurations; automated mechanisms supporting review and update of the
  baseline configuration].

  configuration of the information system when required due to
  organization-defined circumstances."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed reviews and updates the baseline
  configuration of the information system when required due to baseline
  configuration changes or as events dictate such as changes due to USCYBERCOM
  tactical orders/ directives or cyber attacks. The organization must document
  each occurrence of the reviews and update actions as an audit trail. DoD has
  defined the circumstances as baseline configuration changes or as events
  dictate such as changes due to USCYBERCOM tactical orders/ directives or cyber
  attacks.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documented change to baseline configuration due to organization-defined
  circumstances
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines documentation of organizational reviews and update
  actions for the baseline configuration of the information system when required
  due to baseline configuration changes or as events dictate such as changes due
  to USCYBERCOM tactical orders/ directives or cyber attacks to ensure review
  and necessary updates are occurring. DoD has defined the circumstances as
  baseline configuration changes or as events dictate such as changes due to
  USCYBERCOM tactical orders/ directives or cyber attacks.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS platform strongly
  supports timely reviews and updates of the baseline configuration due to
  organization-defined circumstances (e.g., significant security updates, system
  component upgrades, identified vulnerabilities, or significant operational
  changes). UDS utilizes Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via OpenTofu and secure
  deployment with signed Zarf packages, enabling rapid updates,
  version-controlled documentation, and consistent deployment of system changes.
  Automated policy enforcement with Pepr quickly detect configuration
  deviations, facilitating prompt responses and updates. However, explicitly
  defining, documenting, and formally approving the specific circumstances
  (directives or task orders per USCYBERCOM) triggering baseline configuration
  reviews and updates remains an organizational procedural responsibility.
