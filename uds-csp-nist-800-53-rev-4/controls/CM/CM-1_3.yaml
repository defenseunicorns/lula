control-acronym: CM-1
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel or roles]:

  1. A configuration management policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
  responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational
  entities, and compliance; and

  2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the configuration management
  policy and associated configuration management controls; and

  b. Reviews and updates the current:

  1. Configuration management policy [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency]; and

  2. Configuration management procedures [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
  effective implementation of selected security controls and control
  enhancements in the CM family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable
  federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
  and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization
  level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures
  unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information
  security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by
  multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The
  procedures can be established for the security program in general and for
  particular information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management
  strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures. Related
  control: PM-9.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy and procedures; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].

  management policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed develops and documents a
  configuration management policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles,
  responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational
  entities, and compliance.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated configuration management policy
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the configuration management policy that addresses
  purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination
  among organizational entities, and compliance.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The UDS technology stack
  does not create or document configuration management policies, as this is a
  policy-driven activity. The responsibility for developing, documenting, and
  disseminating a configuration management policy, as well as associated
  procedures, lies with the organization. However, UDS provides tools to assist
  in conducting configuration management. This includes the UDS CLI and
  utilizing Zarf as delivery methods for the UDS technology stack itself. These
  tools support the implementation of configuration management practices by
  enabling efficient deployment and management of the UDS components. While the
  UDS platform provides these technical capabilities, the strategic planning,
  execution, and documentation of configuration management policies and
  procedures are managed by Mission Hero, ensuring alignment with organizational
  requirements and security policies.)
