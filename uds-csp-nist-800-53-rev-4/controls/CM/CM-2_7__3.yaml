  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Issues [Assignment: organization-defined information systems, system
  components, or devices] with [Assignment: organization-defined configurations]
  to individuals traveling to locations that the organization deems to be of
  significant risk; and

  (b) Applies [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] to the
  devices when the individuals return.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  When it is known that information systems, system components, or devices
  (e.g., notebook computers, mobile devices) will be located in high-risk areas,
  additional security controls may be implemented to counter the greater threat
  in such areas coupled with the lack of physical security relative to
  organizational-controlled areas. For example, organizational policies and
  procedures for notebook computers used by individuals departing on and
  returning from travel include, for example, determining which locations are of
  concern, defining required configurations for the devices, ensuring that the
  devices are configured as intended before travel is initiated, and applying
  specific safeguards to the device after travel is completed. Specially
  configured notebook computers include, for example, computers with sanitized
  hard drives, limited applications, and additional hardening (e.g., more
  stringent configuration settings). Specified safeguards applied to mobile
  devices upon return from travel include, for example, examining the device for
  signs of physical tampering and purging/reimaging the hard disk drive.
  Protecting information residing on mobile devices is covered in the media
  protection family.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; configuration
  management plan; procedures addressing the baseline configuration of the
  information system; procedures addressing information system component
  installations and upgrades; information system architecture and configuration
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; records of information system baseline configuration reviews
  and updates; information system component installations/upgrades and
  associated records; change control records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing baseline
  configurations].

  information systems, system components, or devices with organization-defined

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed issues information systems, system
  components, or devices as defined in CM-2 (7) CCI 1737 with configurations as
  defined in CM-2 (7) CCI 1738 to individuals traveling to locations the
  organization deems to be of significant risk.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated remote access policy and procedures
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  interviews organizational personnel with configuration management
  responsibilities to ensure that individuals traveling to locations that the
  organization deems to be of significant risk are issued information systems,
  system components, or devices as defined in CM-2 (7) CCI 1737 with
  configurations as defined in CM-2 (7) CCI 1738.

  deemed to be of significant risk. The responsibility for defining and issuing
  these configurations lies with organization.)
