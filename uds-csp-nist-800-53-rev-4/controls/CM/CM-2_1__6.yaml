control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization reviews and updates the baseline configuration of the
  information system:

  (a) [Assignment: organization-defined frequency];

  (b) When required due to [Assignment organization-defined circumstances]; and

  (c) As an integral part of information system component installations and
  upgrades.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related control: CM-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; configuration
  management plan; procedures addressing the baseline configuration of the
  information system; procedures addressing information system component
  installations and upgrades; information system architecture and configuration
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; records of information system baseline configuration reviews
  and updates; information system component installations/upgrades and
  associated records; change control records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing baseline
  configurations; automated mechanisms supporting review and update of the
  baseline configuration].

  system component upgrades."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed reviews and updates the baseline
  configuration of the information system as an integral part of information
  system component upgrades. The organization must document each occurrence of
  the reviews and update actions as an audit trail.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated configuration management policy referencing section with
  reviews and updates to baseline configuration
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines documentation of organizational reviews and update
  actions for the baseline configuration of the information system as an
  integral part of information system component upgrades to ensure review and
  necessary updates are occurring.

test-results: UDS inherently ensures baseline configurations are reviewed,
  updated, and maintained as an integral part of each information system
  component upgrade. Utilizing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via OpenTofu,
  coupled with secure and controlled software deployments using signed Zarf
  packages, UDS automatically captures and documents any configuration updates,
  component changes, or upgrades within version-controlled repositories. These
  baseline configurations are immediately updated and consistently reflected
  across all deployments. Automated policy enforcement through Pepr further
  validate and ensure compliance with the defined baseline, rapidly detecting
  and responding to any configuration deviations. Thus, UDS fully meets the
  requirements of this control, providing seamless, integrated baseline
  configuration management during system component upgrades.
