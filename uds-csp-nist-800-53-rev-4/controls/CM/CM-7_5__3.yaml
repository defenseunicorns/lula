control-acronym: CM-7(5)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Identifies [Assignment: organization-defined software programs authorized
  to execute on the information system];

  (b) Employs a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of
  authorized software programs on the information system; and

  (c) Reviews and updates the list of authorized software programs [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The process used to identify software programs that are authorized to execute
  on organizational information systems is commonly referred to as whitelisting.
  In addition to whitelisting, organizations consider verifying the integrity of
  white-listed software programs using, for example, cryptographic checksums,
  digital signatures, or hash functions. Verification of white-listed software
  can occur either prior to execution or at system startup. Related controls:
  CM-2, CM-6, CM-8, PM-5, SA-10, SC-34, SI-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  least functionality in the information system; configuration management plan;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; list of software programs authorized to
  execute on the information system; security configuration checklists; review
  and update records associated with list of authorized software programs;
  change control records; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  identifying software authorized to execute on the information system;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational process for identifying, reviewing, and
  updating programs authorized to execute on the information system;
  organizational process for implementing whitelisting; automated mechanisms
  implementing whitelisting].

cci-definition: "001774: The organization employs an deny-all,
  permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of authorized software
  programs on the information system."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  deny-all and only permit by exception the execution of authorized software
  programs on the information system.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan (SSP)
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure that it is configured to deny-all
  and only permit by exception the execution of authorized software programs on
  the information system.
inherited: Local
remote-inheritance-instance: "-"
compliance-status: Compliant
test-results: UDS platform employs a strict deny-all, permit-by-exception
  approach to software execution, enforced through multiple integrated security
  mechanisms. Specifically, deployment and execution within the Kubernetes
  environment are strictly controlled using secure Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
  via OpenTofu and signed Zarf packages, ensuring only explicitly authorized and
  cryptographically validated software can be deployed and executed. The policy
  engine, Pepr, explicitly enforces this principle by denying any deployment or
  execution attempt not explicitly approved or defined.
