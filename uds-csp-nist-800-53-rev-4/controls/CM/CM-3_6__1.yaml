control-acronym: CM-3(6)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization ensures that cryptographic mechanisms used to provide
  [Assignment: organization-defined security safeguards] are under configuration
  management.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Regardless of the cryptographic means employed (e.g., public key, private key,
  shared secrets), organizations ensure that there are processes and procedures
  in place to effectively manage those means. For example, if devices use
  certificates as a basis for identification and authentication, there needs to
  be a process in place to address the expiration of those certificates. Related
  control: SC-13.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  information system configuration change control; configuration management
  plan; security plan; information system design documentation; information
  system architecture and configuration documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration change
  control responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for configuration change control;
  cryptographic mechanisms implementing organizational security safeguards].
