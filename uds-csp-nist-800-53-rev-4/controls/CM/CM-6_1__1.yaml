  Description:

  The organization employs automated mechanisms to centrally manage, apply, and
  verify configuration settings for [Assignment: organization-defined
  information system components].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related controls: CA-7, CM-4.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  configuration settings for the information system; configuration management
  plan; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; security configuration
  checklists; change control records; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with security configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing configuration
  settings; automated mechanisms implemented to centrally manage, apply, and
  verify information system configuration settings].

cci-definition: "000370: The organization employs automated mechanisms to
  centrally manage configuration settings for organization-defined information
  system components."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed identifies, documents in the
  configuration management policy, and implements automated mechanisms to
  centrally manage configuration settings.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated configuration management policy, which documents
  automated mechanisms to centrally manage configuration settings
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the configuration management policy to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed identifies automated mechanisms to
  centrally manage configuration settings. The organization being
  inspected/assessed may be required to demonstrate use of their identified
  automated mechanisms.

compliance-status: Compliant
test-results: In UDS, configuration settings for all critical system components
  are managed centrally and automatically through an integrated, declarative
  deployment pipeline. Using Infrastructure as Code with OpenTofu and Zarf, the
  organization codifies approved configuration baselines for components like
  Kubernetes, Istio, Keycloak, and NeuVector. Pepr policies are employed to
  enforce these settings during deployment and operational transitions, ensuring
  that any configuration changes are automatically validated against established
  baselines. Complementary monitoring and centralized dashboards via Prometheus,
  Grafana, and Loki provide continuous visibility and alerting for any
  deviations, ensuring that the entire environment remains compliant.
