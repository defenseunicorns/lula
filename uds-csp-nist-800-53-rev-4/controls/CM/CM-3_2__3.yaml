control-acronym: CM-3(2)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization tests, validates, and documents changes to the information
  system before implementing the changes on the operational system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Changes to information systems include modifications to hardware, software, or
  firmware components and configuration settings defined in CM-6. Organizations
  ensure that testing does not interfere with information system operations.
  Individuals/groups conducting tests understand organizational security
  policies and procedures, information system security policies and procedures,
  and the specific health, safety, and environmental risks associated with
  particular facilities/processes. Operational systems may need to be taken
  off-line, or replicated to the extent feasible, before testing can be
  conducted. If information systems must be taken off-line for testing, the
  tests are scheduled to occur during planned system outages whenever possible.
  If testing cannot be conducted on operational systems, organizations employ
  compensating controls (e.g., testing on replicated systems).


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; configuration
  management plan; procedures addressing information system configuration change
  control; information system design documentation; information system
  architecture and configuration documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; test records; validation records;
  change control records; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration change
  control responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for configuration change control;
  automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing testing, validating, and
  documenting information system changes].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to document changes to the information system before implementing the changes
  on the operational system.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Change management testing procedures
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process as well as documentation of
  changes to the information system to ensure the organization has established,
  published, and is complying with the requirement to document all changes to be
  made to its operational information system(s) prior to their implementation.

remote-inheritance-instance: "-"
compliance-status: Compliant
test-results: UDS fully meets the requirement to document changes to the
  information system before they are implemented in operational environments.
  Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices using OpenTofu, combined with secure
  deployment mechanisms via signed Zarf packages, inherently provide clear and
  comprehensive documentation of every proposed system change. All changes,
  including software updates, infrastructure modifications, and security policy
  adjustments, are systematically documented, version-controlled, and auditable.
  Audit trails generated by Vector and stored securely in Loki further ensure
  traceability and accountability of these documented changes. Collectively,
  these capabilities ensure complete and verifiable documentation of system
  changes prior to operational deployment, fully satisfying the intent of this
  control.
