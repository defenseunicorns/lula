control-acronym: CM-7(5)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Identifies [Assignment: organization-defined software programs authorized
  to execute on the information system];

  (b) Employs a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of
  authorized software programs on the information system; and

  (c) Reviews and updates the list of authorized software programs [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  The process used to identify software programs that are authorized to execute
  on organizational information systems is commonly referred to as whitelisting.
  In addition to whitelisting, organizations consider verifying the integrity of
  white-listed software programs using, for example, cryptographic checksums,
  digital signatures, or hash functions. Verification of white-listed software
  can occur either prior to execution or at system startup. Related controls:
  CM-2, CM-6, CM-8, PM-5, SA-10, SC-34, SI-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  least functionality in the information system; configuration management plan;
  information system design documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; list of software programs authorized to
  execute on the information system; security configuration checklists; review
  and update records associated with list of authorized software programs;
  change control records; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  identifying software authorized to execute on the information system;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities;
  system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational process for identifying, reviewing, and
  updating programs authorized to execute on the information system;
  organizational process for implementing whitelisting; automated mechanisms
  implementing whitelisting].

  automatically compliant with this CCI because they are covered at the DoD
  level. DoD has defined the frequency as monthly.
