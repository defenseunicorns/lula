control-acronym: CM-8(5)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization verifies that all components within the authorization
  boundary of the information system are not duplicated in other information
  system component inventories.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement addresses the potential problem of duplicate
  accounting of information system components in large or complex interconnected
  systems.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  information system component inventory; configuration management plan;
  security plan; information system inventory records; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  inventory responsibilities; organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  defining information system components within the authorization boundary of
  the system; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for maintaining the inventory of
  information system components; automated mechanisms implementing the
  information system component inventory].

  The organization being inspected/assessed verifies that all components within
  the authorization boundary of the information system are not duplicated in
  other information system inventories.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Configuration (hardware) baseline
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the inventory list of the authorized information system
  and verifies that all components identified during the inspection are not
  duplicated in other information system inventories.

test-results: UDS inherently supports accurate tracking and management of
  deployed components through Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via OpenTofu and
  secure deployment packages with Zarf. These methods provide a definitive,
  consistent record of components deployed within the information system,
  significantly reducing the risk of duplicate, redundant, or unauthorized
  system components. The UDS user interface is automatically updated to maintain
  a complete real-time inventory of software deployed within UDS.
