control-acronym: CM-2
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization develops, documents, and maintains under configuration
  control, a current baseline configuration of the information system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control establishes baseline configurations for information systems and
  system components including communications and connectivity-related aspects of
  systems. Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed and
  agreed-upon sets of specifications for information systems or configuration
  items within those systems. Baseline configurations serve as a basis for
  future builds, releases, and/or changes to information systems. Baseline
  configurations include information about information system components (e.g.,
  standard software packages installed on workstations, notebook computers,
  servers, network components, or mobile devices; current version numbers and
  patch information on operating systems and applications; and configuration
  settings/parameters), network topology, and the logical placement of those
  components within the system architecture. Maintaining baseline configurations
  requires creating new baselines as organizational information systems change
  over time. Baseline configurations of information systems reflect the current
  enterprise architecture. Related controls: CM-3, CM-6, CM-8, CM-9, SA-10,
  PM-5, PM-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  the baseline configuration of the information system; configuration management
  plan; enterprise architecture documentation; information system design
  documentation; information system architecture and configuration
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; change control records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with configuration
  management responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing baseline
  configurations; automated mechanisms supporting configuration control of the
  baseline configuration].

  The organization being inspected/assessed maintains a current baseline
  configuration of the information system.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Baseline configuration of the information system (hardware and software
  list)
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the current baseline to ensure the current configuration
  matches the current documented baseline.

test-results: UDS effectively maintains current baseline configurations under
  configuration control through robust technical mechanisms. Using
  Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with OpenTofu, the UDS platform ensures
  configurations are version-controlled, documented, and securely stored in
  repositories, enabling consistent deployment, rollback, and auditing. Secure
  distribution via signed Zarf packages ensures only authorized, vetted
  configurations are deployed within the environment. Additionally, automated
  policy enforcement by Pepr, continuously validates the deployed configuration
  against the documented baseline, promptly detecting and alerting
  administrators to any deviations. These integrated capabilities ensure the
  baseline configuration remains current, consistently controlled, and fully
  auditable, satisfying the intent of this control.
