  Description:

  The information system enforces access restrictions and supports auditing of
  the enforcement actions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related controls: AU-2, AU-12, AU-6, CM-3, CM-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  access restrictions for changes to the information system; information system
  design documentation; information system architecture and configuration
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; change control records; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing access restrictions
  to change; automated mechanisms implementing enforcement of access
  restrictions for changes to the information system; automated mechanisms
  supporting auditing of enforcement actions].

cci-definition: "001814: The Information system supports auditing of the enforcement actions."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed leverages only information systems
  which support auditing of enforcement actions.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation or assessment test results of audits
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  reviews vendor documentation to ensure the information system supports
  auditing of the enforcement actions. If vendor documentation is not available,
  the organization conducting the inspection/assessment tests the information
  system for the capability.

compliance-status: Compliant
test-results: UDS fully supports comprehensive auditing of enforcement actions
  through integrated logging, monitoring, and audit capabilities. Enforcement
  actions performed by the platform including identity and access control
  decisions via Keycloak, Kubernetes RBAC policy enforcement, and Istio
  authorization policy enforcement generate detailed audit records. These
  records include timestamps, user identities, actions taken, source/destination
  details, and success or failure outcomes. Audit data is systematically
  collected via Vector, centrally stored and indexed in Loki, and presented
  visually in Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring and retrospective
  analysis. Runtime security enforcement provided by NeuVector and policy
  enforcement by Pepr also produce auditable events, enhancing the traceability
  of enforcement actions. Collectively, these capabilities ensure robust
  auditing support, fully meeting the intent of this control.
