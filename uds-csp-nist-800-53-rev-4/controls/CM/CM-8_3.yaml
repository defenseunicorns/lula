control-acronym: CM-8
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Develops and documents an inventory of information system components that:

  1. Accurately reflects the current information system;

  2. Includes all components within the authorization boundary of the
  information system;

  3. Is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting;
  and

  4. Includes [Assignment: organization-defined information deemed necessary to
  achieve effective information system component accountability]; and

  b. Reviews and updates the information system component inventory [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].

  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations may choose to implement centralized information system component
  inventories that include components from all organizational information
  systems. In such situations, organizations ensure that the resulting
  inventories include system-specific information required for proper component
  accountability (e.g., information system association, information system
  owner). Information deemed necessary for effective accountability of
  information system components includes, for example, hardware inventory
  specifications, software license information, software version numbers,
  component owners, and for networked components or devices, machine names and
  network addresses. Inventory specifications include, for example,
  manufacturer, device type, model, serial number, and physical location.

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  information system component inventory; configuration management plan;
  security plan; information system inventory records; inventory reviews and
  update records; other relevant documents or records].

  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  information system component inventory; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities; system/network administrators].

  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for developing and documenting an
  inventory of information system components; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing the information system component inventory].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents inventory of information
  system components that is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for
  tracking and reporting.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Configuration (hardware) baseline
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented inventory and examines a sampling of
  information system components to ensure inventory is at the level of
  granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting.

  detailed list of software and components within UDS there might be others for
  the organization to report on that fall outside the boundary of UDS.)
