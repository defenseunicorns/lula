control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization defines, documents, approves, and enforces physical and
  logical access restrictions associated with changes to the information system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of
  information systems can potentially have significant effects on the overall
  security of the systems. Therefore, organizations permit only qualified and
  authorized individuals to access information systems for purposes of
  initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications. Organizations
  maintain records of access to ensure that configuration change control is
  implemented and to support after-the-fact actions should organizations
  discover any unauthorized changes. Access restrictions for change also include
  software libraries. Access restrictions include, for example, physical and
  logical access controls (see AC-3 and PE-3), workflow automation, media
  libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes implemented into third-party
  interfaces rather than directly into information systems), and change windows
  (e.g., changes occur only during specified times, making unauthorized changes
  easy to discover). Related controls: AC-3, AC-6, PE-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  access restrictions for changes to the information system; configuration
  management plan; information system design documentation; information system
  architecture and configuration documentation; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; logical access approvals; physical
  access approvals; access credentials; change control records; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with logical access control
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with physical access control
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing access restrictions
  to change; automated mechanisms supporting/implementing/enforcing access
  restrictions associated with changes to the information system].

cci-definition: "000344: The organization approves logical access restrictions
  associated with changes to the information system."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to approve logical access restrictions associated with changes to the
  information system. The organization must maintain an audit trail of
  approvals.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated configuration management policy referencing logical
  access restrictions section
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process as well as the audit trail of
  approvals to ensure the organization being inspected/assessed approves logical
  access restrictions associated with changes to the information system.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS platform provides
  strong technical capabilities to define and enforce logical access
  restrictions associated with information system changes. Using centralized
  identity management through Keycloak and Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control
  (RBAC), UDS enables granular control of who can propose, approve, and
  implement system changes. Additionally, infrastructure management through
  OpenTofu and secure deployments via signed Zarf packages ensures that changes
  are version-controlled and auditable. However, explicitly defining and
  formally documenting logical access restrictions such as identifying specific
  roles or individuals authorized to perform particular types of system changes
  remains an organizational responsibility.
