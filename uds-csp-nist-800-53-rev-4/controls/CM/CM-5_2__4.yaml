control-acronym: CM-5(2)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization reviews information system changes [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] and [Assignment: organization-defined
  circumstances] to determine whether unauthorized changes have occurred.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Indications that warrant review of information system changes and the specific
  circumstances justifying such reviews may be obtained from activities carried
  out by organizations during the configuration change process. Related
  controls: AU-6, AU-7, CM-3, CM-5, PE-6, PE-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  access restrictions for changes to the information system; configuration
  management plan; security plan; reviews of information system changes; audit
  and review reports; change control records; information system audit records;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing access restrictions
  to change; automated mechanisms supporting/implementing information system
  reviews to determine whether unauthorized changes have occurred].
