  Description:

  The organization updates the inventory of information system components as an
  integral part of component installations, removals, and information system
  updates.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  information system component inventory; configuration management plan;
  security plan; information system inventory records; inventory reviews and
  update records; component installation records; component removal records;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  updating the information system component inventory; organizational personnel
  with information security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for updating inventory of
  information system components; automated mechanisms implementing updating of
  the information system component inventory].

  system components as an integral part of information system updates."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to update the inventory of information system components as an integral part
  of information system updates. The organization must maintain an audit trail
  of updates. The audit trail may be recorded within the inventory itself.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated system security plan (SSP)

  2.) Audit trail of hardware list updates
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process for updates as well as the audit
  trail of updates and the log of changes to the information system to ensure
  the organization being inspected/assessed updates the inventory of information
  system components as an integral part of information system updates.
