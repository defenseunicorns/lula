control-acronym: CM-5(2)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization reviews information system changes [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] and [Assignment: organization-defined
  circumstances] to determine whether unauthorized changes have occurred.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Indications that warrant review of information system changes and the specific
  circumstances justifying such reviews may be obtained from activities carried
  out by organizations during the configuration change process. Related
  controls: AU-6, AU-7, CM-3, CM-5, PE-6, PE-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  access restrictions for changes to the information system; configuration
  management plan; security plan; reviews of information system changes; audit
  and review reports; change control records; information system audit records;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing access restrictions
  to change; automated mechanisms supporting/implementing information system
  reviews to determine whether unauthorized changes have occurred].

cci-definition: "000350: The organization reviews information system changes
  upon organization-defined circumstances to determine whether unauthorized
  changes have occurred."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to review the information system changes when there is an incident or when
  planned changes have been performed to determine whether unauthorized changes
  have occurred. 


  The organization must maintain this review as an audit trail.


  DoD has defined the circumstances as when there is an incident or when planned
  changes have been performed.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated configuration management policy, which documents a
  process to review information system changes when there is an incident or when
  planned changes have been performed to determine whether unauthorized changes
  have occurred

  2.) Sample of this process
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented process as well as the audit trail of reviews to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed reviews the information system changes
  when there is an incident or when planned changes have been performed to
  determine whether unauthorized changes have occurred. 


  DoD has defined the circumstances as when there is an incident or when planned
  changes have been performed.

  provides the necessary tools to support the analysis of system changes but
  does not perform the review of unauthorized changes itself.)
