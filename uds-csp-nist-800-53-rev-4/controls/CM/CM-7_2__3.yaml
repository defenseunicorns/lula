control-acronym: CM-7(2)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system prevents program execution in accordance with
  [Selection (one or more): [Assignment: organization-defined policies regarding
  software program usage and restrictions]; rules authorizing the terms and
  conditions of software program usage].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Related controls: CM-8, PM-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  least functionality in the information system; configuration management plan;
  security plan; information system design documentation; specifications for
  preventing software program execution; information system configuration
  settings and associated documentation; change control records; information
  system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes preventing program execution on
  the information system; organizational processes for software program usage
  and restrictions; automated mechanisms preventing program execution on the
  information system; automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  software program usage and restrictions].

  accordance with organization-defined policies regarding software program usage
  and restrictions, and/or rules authorizing the terms and conditions of
  software program usage."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  prevent the execution of programs not authorized in accordance with CM-7 (2)
  CCIs 1592 and 1763.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information systems to ensure the systems are configured to
  prevent the execution of programs not authorized in accordance with CM-7 (2)
  CCIs 1592 and 1763.

compliance-status: Compliant
test-results: UDS enforces strict controls to prevent unauthorized or unapproved
  software execution in alignment with organizationally defined software usage
  policies. Specifically, software deployments occur exclusively through signed
  and validated Zarf packages, ensuring only authorized, securely verified
  container images and application components can run within Kubernetes
  clusters. OpenTofu manages infrastructure resources and system configurations
  in a consistent, version-controlled, and declarative manner. By defining and
  enforcing strict configurations, OpenTofu ensures that only approved software
  and container images are provisioned and executed within the Kubernetes
  clusters.
