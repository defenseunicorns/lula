control-acronym: CM-9
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization develops, documents, and implements a configuration
  management plan for the information system that

  a. Addresses roles, responsibilities, and configuration management processes
  and procedures;

  b. Establishes a process for identifying configuration items throughout the
  system development life cycle and for managing the configuration of the
  configuration items;

  c. Defines the configuration items for the information system and places the
  configuration items under configuration management; and

  d. Protects the configuration management plan from unauthorized disclosure and
  modification.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Configuration management plans satisfy the requirements in configuration
  management policies while being tailored to individual information systems.
  Such plans define detailed processes and procedures for how configuration
  management is used to support system development life cycle activities at the
  information system level. Configuration management plans are typically
  developed during the development/acquisition phase of the system development
  life cycle. The plans describe how to move changes through change management
  processes, how to update configuration settings and baselines, how to maintain
  information system component inventories, how to control development, test,
  and operational environments, and how to develop, release, and update key
  documents. Organizations can employ templates to help ensure consistent and
  timely development and implementation of configuration management plans. Such
  templates can represent a master configuration management plan for the
  organization at large with subsets of the plan implemented on a system by
  system basis. Configuration management approval processes include designation
  of key management stakeholders responsible for reviewing and approving
  proposed changes to information systems, and personnel that conduct security
  impact analyses prior to the implementation of changes to the systems.
  Configuration items are the information system items (hardware, software,
  firmware, and documentation) to be configuration-managed. As information
  systems continue through the system development life cycle, new configuration
  items may be identified and some existing configuration items may no longer
  need to be under configuration control. Related controls: CM-2, CM-3, CM-4,
  CM-5, CM-8, SA-10.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  configuration management planning; configuration management plan; security
  plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  developing the configuration management plan; organizational personnel with
  responsibilities for implementing and managing processes defined in the
  configuration management plan; organizational personnel with responsibilities
  for protecting the configuration management plan; organizational personnel
  with information security responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for developing and documenting
  the configuration management plan; organizational processes for identifying
  and managing configuration items; organizational processes for protecting the
  configuration management plan; automated mechanisms implementing the
  configuration management plan; automated mechanisms for managing configuration
  items; automated mechanisms for protecting the configuration management plan].

cci-definition: "001801: The organization implements a configuration management
  plan for the information system that protects the configuration management
  plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed must implement a plan to protect the
  configuration management plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.
  Measures must include marking, labeling, and handling to prevent improper
  disclosure. The organization being inspected/assessed must ensure that all
  changes to the CM plan are approved.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated configuration management plan
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the configuration management plan to verify that the
  identified protection measures are implemented.
inherited: Local
remote-inheritance-instance: "-"
test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (The organization must
  define and manage the configuration management plan outside of UDS.)
