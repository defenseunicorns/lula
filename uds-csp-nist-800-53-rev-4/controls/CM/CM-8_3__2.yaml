control-acronym: CM-8(3)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  (a) Employs automated mechanisms [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]
  to detect the presence of unauthorized hardware, software, and firmware
  components within the information system; and

  (b) Takes the following actions when unauthorized components are detected:
  [Selection (one or more): disables network access by such components; isolates
  the components; notifies [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
  roles]].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement is applied in addition to the monitoring for
  unauthorized remote connections and mobile devices. Monitoring for
  unauthorized system components may be accomplished on an ongoing basis or by
  the periodic scanning of systems for that purpose. Automated mechanisms can be
  implemented within information systems or in other separate devices. Isolation
  can be achieved, for example, by placing unauthorized information system
  components in separate domains or subnets or otherwise quarantining such
  components. This type of component isolation is commonly referred to as
  sandboxing. Related controls: AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, CA-7, SI-3, SI-4, SI-7,
  RA-5.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; procedures addressing
  information system component inventory; configuration management plan;
  security plan; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; information system
  inventory records; alerts/notifications of unauthorized components within the
  information system; information system monitoring records; change control
  records; information system audit records; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  managing the automated mechanisms implementing unauthorized information system
  component detection; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for detection of unauthorized
  information system components; automated mechanisms implementing the detection
  of unauthorized information system components].

cci: 416
cci-definition: "000416: The organization employs automated mechanisms, per
  organization defined frequency, to detect the presence of unauthorized
  hardware, software, and firmware components within the information system."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements automated
  mechanisms to detect the presence of unauthorized hardware, software, and
  firmware components within the information system continuously. DoD has
  defined the frequency as continuously.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated continuous monitoring policy
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documentation identifying the automated mechanisms
  and examines the implemented automated mechanisms to ensure the organization
  being inspected/assessed employs automated mechanisms, continuously, to detect
  the presence of unauthorized hardware, software, and firmware components
  within the information system. DoD has defined the frequency as continuously.
