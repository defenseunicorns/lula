  Description:

  The organization reviews and updates the audited events [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Over time, the events that organizations believe should be audited may change.
  Reviewing and updating the set of audited events periodically is necessary to
  ensure that the current set is still necessary and sufficient.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  auditable events; security plan; list of organization-defined auditable
  events; auditable events review and update records; information system audit
  records; information system incident reports; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting review and update of
  auditable events].
