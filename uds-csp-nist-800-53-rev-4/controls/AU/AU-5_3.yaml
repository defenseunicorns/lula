control-acronym: AU-5
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system:

  a. Alerts [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] in the event
  of an audit processing failure; and

  b. Takes the following additional actions: [Assignment: organization-defined
  actions to be taken (e.g., shut down information system, overwrite oldest
  audit records, stop generating audit records)].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit processing failures include, for example, software/hardware errors,
  failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being
  reached or exceeded. Organizations may choose to define additional actions for
  different audit processing failures (e.g., by type, by location, by severity,
  or a combination of such factors). This control applies to each audit data
  storage repository (i.e., distinct information system component where audit
  records are stored), the total audit storage capacity of organizations (i.e.,
  all audit data storage repositories combined), or both. Related controls:
  AU-4, SI-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  response to audit processing failures; information system design
  documentation; security plan; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; list of personnel to be notified in case of an audit
  processing failure; information system audit records; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing information system
  response to audit processing failures].

cci-definition: "000140: The information system takes organization defined
  actions upon audit failure (e.g., shut down information system, overwrite
  oldest audit records, stop generating audit records)."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  take actions as defined in AU-5, CCI 1490 upon audit failure. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  140.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed has configured the information system to take actions as
  defined in AU-5, CCI 1490 upon audit failure. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 140.
