control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization employs automated mechanisms to integrate audit review,
  analysis, and reporting processes to support organizational processes for
  investigation and response to suspicious activities.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizational processes benefiting from integrated audit review, analysis,
  and reporting include, for example, incident response, continuous monitoring,
  contingency planning, and Inspector General audits. Related controls: AU-12,
  PM-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit review, analysis, and reporting; procedures addressing investigation and
  response to suspicious activities; information system design documentation;
  information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit review, analysis,
  and reporting responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms integrating audit review, analysis,
  and reporting processes].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed identifies and implements automated
  mechanisms to integrate reporting processes (e.g., centralized log analysis
  tools). The goal is to support organizational investigation of and response to
  suspicious activities.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines documentation identifying automated mechanisms to
  integrate reporting processes to ensure such mechanisms have been identified.
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the identified
  automated mechanisms to ensure they have been implemented.
