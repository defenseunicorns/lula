control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system:

  a. Provides audit record generation capability for the auditable events
  defined in AU-2 a. at [Assignment: organization-defined information system
  components];

  b. Allows [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to select
  which auditable events are to be audited by specific components of the
  information system; and

  c. Generates audit records for the events defined in AU-2

  d. with the content defined in AU-3.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit records can be generated from many different information system
  components. The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits
  are to be generated. These events are typically a subset of all events for
  which the information system is capable of generating audit records. Related
  controls: AC-3, AU-2, AU-3, AU-6, AU-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit record generation; security plan; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; list of auditable events; information system audit records;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit record generation
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing audit record generation
  capability].

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy

  2.) List of information system components that provide audit record generation
  capability

  information system and network components.
inherited: Local

compliance-status: Compliant
test-results: UDS includes comprehensive audit record generation capabilities
  across its key system components. Specifically, components such as Keycloak
  (for identity management), Istio Service Mesh (for network traffic and policy
  enforcement), NeuVector (for container security monitoring), Kubernetes itself
  (for resource access and configuration management), and integrated logging
  solutions (Vector and Loki) collectively provide detailed and structured audit
  records of security-relevant events. Audit records include user authentication
  events, resource access attempts, configuration changes, and runtime
  anomalies.
