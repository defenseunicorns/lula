control-acronym: AU-5(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system provides a warning to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel, roles, and/or locations] within [Assignment: organization-defined
  time period] when allocated audit record storage volume reaches [Assignment:
  organization-defined percentage] of repository maximum audit record storage
  capacity.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations may have multiple audit data storage repositories distributed
  across multiple information system components, with each repository having
  different storage volume capacities.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  response to audit processing failures; information system design
  documentation; security plan; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing audit storage limit
  warnings].

cci-definition: "001852: The organization defines the personnel, roles and/or
  locations to receive a warning when allocated audit record storage volume
  reaches a defined percentage of maximum audit records storage capacity."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents any personnel
  or roles, in addition to the ISSO/PMO and ISSM, who shall receive a warning
  when allocated audit record storage volume reaches a defined percentage of
  maximum audit records storage capacity. If there are no additional personnel
  or roles, the organization must also document that.

  DoD has defined the personnel or roles as at a minimum, the ISSO/PMO and ISSM.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) List of personnel who receive indications of organization-defined
  inappropriate or unusual activity
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment obtains and examines the
  documented list of personnel or roles who should receive a warning when
  allocated audit record storage volume reaches a defined percentage of maximum
  audit records storage capacity to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed has either defined additional personnel or roles, or
  identified that there are no additional personnel or roles beyond the ISSO/PMO
  and ISSM.


  DoD has defined the personnel or roles as at a minimum, the ISSO/PMO and ISSM.

test-results: The UDS monitoring components (Prometheus/Grafana) keep an eye on
  system health, including the logging pipeline. If the log collector (Vector)
  or log store (Loki) fails or fills up, this would generate alerts (e.g., a
  Prometheus alert if Loki is unreachable or if disk usage for logs is high).
  Administrators would be notified to take action (such as allocate more space
  or restart services). While UDS does not automatically switch to an alternate
  logging mechanism upon failure, it does ensure that failures are detected and
  can be responded to in a timely manner
