control-acronym: AU-12(3)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system provides the capability for [Assignment:
  organization-defined individuals or roles] to change the auditing to be
  performed on [Assignment: organization-defined information system components]
  based on [Assignment: organization-defined selectable event criteria] within
  [Assignment: organization-defined time thresholds].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement enables organizations to extend or limit auditing as
  necessary to meet organizational requirements. Auditing that is limited to
  conserve information system resources may be extended to address certain
  threat situations. In addition, auditing may be limited to a specific set of
  events to facilitate audit reduction, analysis, and reporting. Organizations
  can establish time thresholds in which audit actions are changed, for example,
  near real-time, within minutes, or within hours. Related control: AU-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit record generation; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; system-generated
  list of individuals or roles authorized to change auditing to be performed;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit record generation
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing audit record generation
  capability].

  organization-defined individuals or roles to change the auditing to be
  performed on organization-defined information system components based on
  organization-defined selectable event criteria within organization-defined
  time thresholds."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  provide the capability for individuals or roles defined in AU-12 (3), CCI 1913
  to change the auditing to be performed on information system components
  defined in AU-12 (3), CCI 2047 based on selectable event criteria defined in
  AU-12 (3), CCI 1911 within time thresholds defined in AU-12 (3), CCI 1912. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 1914.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy, referencing section
  which defines the individuals or roles that are to be provided the capability
  to change the auditing.

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to provide the capability
  for individuals or roles defined in AU-12 (3), CCI 1913 to change the auditing
  to be performed on information system components defined in AU-12 (3), CCI
  2047 based on selectable event criteria defined in AU-12 (3), CCI 1911 within
  time thresholds defined in AU-12 (3), CCI 1912. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 1914.

test-results: UDS provides technical capabilities allowing designated
  organizational roles or individuals to dynamically change auditing
  configurations on system components. Through integrated logging and monitoring
  solutions (Vector, Loki, and Grafana) combined with centralized access control
  via Keycloak and Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), UDS ensures
  authorized personnel can quickly adjust audit settings in response to specific
  event criteria, such as security incidents or compliance events.
  Administrators can define, modify, and enforce auditing rules rapidly through
  configurable dashboards and administrative interfaces, enabling timely
  responsiveness within organization-defined thresholds.
