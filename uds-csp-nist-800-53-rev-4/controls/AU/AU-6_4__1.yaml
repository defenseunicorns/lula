  Description:

  The information system provides the capability to centrally review and analyze
  audit records from multiple components within the system.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Automated mechanisms for centralized reviews and analyses include, for
  example, Security Information Management products. Related controls: AU-2,
  AU-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit review, analysis, and reporting; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; security plan; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit review, analysis,
  and reporting responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Information system capability to centralize review and
  analysis of audit records].

  system."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  provide a capability to centrally review and analyze audit records from
  multiple components within the system. For information system components that
  have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must
  comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 154.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed has configured the information system to provide a
  capability to centrally review and analyze audit records from multiple
  components within the system. For information system components that have
  applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 154.

test-results: UDS provides centralized audit log review and analysis
  capabilities using a combination of Loki for log aggregation, Vector for log
  collection and transformation, and Grafana for visualization and analysis.
  These components ensure that audit records from multiple system components,
  including authentication logs from Keycloak, network activity logs from Istio,
  and security events from NeuVector, are collected, normalized, and centrally
  accessible. This enables security teams to efficiently correlate events,
  detect anomalies, and respond to incidents
