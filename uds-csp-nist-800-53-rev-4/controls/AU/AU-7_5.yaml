control-acronym: AU-7
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system provides an audit reduction and report generation
  capability that

  a. Supports on-demand audit review, analysis, and reporting requirements and
  after-the-fact investigations of security incidents; and

  b. Does not alter the original content or time ordering of audit records.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit information and
  organizes such information in a summary format that is more meaningful to
  analysts. Audit reduction and report generation capabilities do not always
  emanate from the same information system or from the same organizational
  entities conducting auditing activities. Audit reduction capability can
  include, for example, modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters
  to identify anomalous behavior in audit records. The report generation
  capability provided by the information system can generate customizable
  reports. Time ordering of audit records can be a significant issue if the
  granularity of the timestamp in the record is insufficient. Related control:
  AU-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit reduction and report generation; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; audit reduction, review, analysis, and reporting tools;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit reduction and
  report generation responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Audit reduction and report generation capability].

cci-definition: "001879: The information system provides a report generation
  capability that supports on-demand reporting requirements."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed must employ information systems that
  provide a report generation capability that support on-demand reporting
  requirements (either natively or through the use of third-party tools). For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 1879.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Example of on-demand audit review and analysis
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure that the organization being
  inspected/assessed employs information systems that provide a report
  generation capability that supports on-demand reporting requirements (either
  natively or through the use of third-party tools). For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 1879.

test-results: The UDS platform provides a robust report generation capability
  for on-demand audit review and analysis through its integrated Vector, Loki,
  and Grafana stack. Loki stores and indexes logs, enabling quick searches and
  filtering based on specific events, while Vector ensures efficient log
  aggregation and transformation. Grafana offers customizable dashboards and
  reporting features, allowing security teams to generate audit reports.
