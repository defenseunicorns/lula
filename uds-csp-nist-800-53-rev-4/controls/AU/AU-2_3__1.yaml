  Description:

  The organization reviews and updates the audited events [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Over time, the events that organizations believe should be audited may change.
  Reviewing and updating the set of audited events periodically is necessary to
  ensure that the current set is still necessary and sufficient.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  auditable events; security plan; list of organization-defined auditable
  events; auditable events review and update records; information system audit
  records; information system incident reports; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting review and update of
  auditable events].

cci-definition: "000127: The organization reviews and updates the list of
  organization-defined audited events on an organization-defined frequency."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will conduct reviews of the list of
  auditable events as defined in AU-2 (d), CCI 1485 annually or more frequently
  upon changes to situational awareness of threats or vulnerabilities. The
  organization will generate and maintain an audit trail to document the
  completion of the review and update actions. DoD has defined the frequency as
  annually or more frequently upon changes to situational awareness of threats
  or vulnerabilities.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation of reviews of the list of auditable events
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  reviews the audit trail showing reviews and updates to the list of audited
  events to ensure that the list is reviewed and updated annually or more
  frequently upon changes to situational awareness of threats or
  vulnerabilities. DoD has defined the frequency as annually or more frequently
  upon changes to situational awareness of threats or vulnerabilities.
