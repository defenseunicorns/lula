control-acronym: AU-5(2)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system provides an alert in [Assignment: organization-defined
  real-time period] to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel, roles,
  and/or locations] when the following audit failure events occur: [Assignment:
  organization-defined audit failure events requiring real-time alerts].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Alerts provide organizations with urgent messages. Real-time alerts provide
  these messages at information technology speed (i.e., the time from event
  detection to alert occurs in seconds or less).


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  response to audit processing failures; information system design
  documentation; security plan; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; records of notifications or real-time alerts when
  audit processing failures occur; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing real-time audit alerts
  when organization-defined audit failure events occur].
