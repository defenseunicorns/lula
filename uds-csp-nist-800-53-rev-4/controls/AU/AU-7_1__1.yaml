control-acronym: AU-7(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system provides the capability to process audit records for
  events of interest based on [Assignment: organization-defined audit fields
  within audit records].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Events of interest can be identified by the content of specific audit record
  fields including, for example, identities of individuals, event types, event
  locations, event times, event dates, system resources involved, IP addresses
  involved, or information objects accessed. Organizations may define audit
  event criteria to any degree of granularity required, for example, locations
  selectable by general networking location (e.g., by network or subnetwork) or
  selectable by specific information system component. Related controls: AU-2,
  AU-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit reduction and report generation; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; audit reduction, review, analysis, and reporting tools; audit
  record criteria (fields) establishing events of interest; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit reduction and
  report generation responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Audit reduction and report generation capability].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed must employ information systems that
  provide the capability to process audit records for events of interest based
  on audit fields within audit records defined in AU-7 (1), CCI 1883. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 158.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Example of audit log report based on events of interest
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure that the organization being
  inspected/assessed employs information systems that provides the capability to
  process audit records for events of interest based on audit fields within
  audit records as defined in AU-7 (1), CCI 1883. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 158.

test-results: The UDS platform provides the capability to process audit records
  for events of interest through its integration with Vector and Loki. Vector
  collects and processes logs based on organization-defined audit fields,
  ensuring that data remains unaltered and preserving the integrity of the
  original audit records. Loki stores these logs in a time-sequenced manner,
  maintaining chronological integrity and enabling accurate forensic analysis.
  The logs can then be visualized in Grafana for deeper analysis.
