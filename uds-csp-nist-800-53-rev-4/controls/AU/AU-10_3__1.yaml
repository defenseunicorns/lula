control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system maintains reviewer/releaser identity and credentials
  within the established chain of custody for all information reviewed or
  released.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Chain of custody is a process that tracks the movement of evidence through its
  collection, safeguarding, and analysis life cycle by documenting each person
  who handled the evidence, the date and time it was collected or transferred,
  and the purpose for the transfer. If the reviewer is a human or if the review
  function is automated but separate from the release/transfer function, the
  information system associates the identity of the reviewer of the information
  to be released with the information and the information label. In the case of
  human reviews, this control enhancement provides organizational officials the
  means to identify who reviewed and released the information. In the case of
  automated reviews, this control enhancement ensures that only approved review
  functions are employed. Related controls: AC-4, AC-16.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  non-repudiation; information system design documentation; information system
  configuration settings and associated documentation; records of information
  reviews and releases; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing non-repudiation
  capability].

cci-definition: "001340: The information system maintains reviewer/releaser
  identity and credentials within the established chain of custody for all
  information reviewed or released."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  maintain reviewer/releaser identity and credentials within the established
  chain of custody for all information reviewed or released. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  1340.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to maintain
  reviewer/releaser identity and credentials within the established chain of
  custody for all information reviewed or released. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 1340.

test-results: UDS supports maintaining reviewer/releaser identity and
  credentials within an established chain of custody through robust identity
  management and audit logging mechanisms. Specifically, user identities and
  credentials validated via Keycloak leveraging strong PKI-based authentication
  (CAC/PIV) are recorded in detailed audit logs collected by Vector and securely
  stored within Loki. These audit logs capture reviewer or releaser identity,
  timestamped actions, and associated events, providing an accurate, auditable
  trail to establish clear chains of custody.
