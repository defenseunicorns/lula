control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system provides centralized management and configuration of
  the content to be captured in audit records generated by [Assignment:
  organization-defined information system components].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement requires that the content to be captured in audit
  records be configured from a central location (necessitating automation).
  Organizations coordinate the selection of required audit content to support
  the centralized management and configuration capability provided by the
  information system. Related controls: AU-6, AU-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  content of audit records; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; list of
  organization-defined auditable events; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Information system capability implementing centralized
  management and configuration of audit record content].

  organization-defined information system components."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  provide centralized management and configuration of the content to be captured
  in audit records generated by all information system and network components.
  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 1844. DoD has defined the information system components
  as all information system and network components.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Applicable STIGs or SRGs
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure that the organization being
  inspected/assessed has configured the information system to provide
  centralized management and configuration of the content to be captured in
  audit records generated by all information system and network components. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 1844. DoD has defined the information system components as all
  information system and network components.
