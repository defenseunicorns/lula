control-acronym: AU-5(2)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system provides an alert in [Assignment: organization-defined
  real-time period] to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel, roles,
  and/or locations] when the following audit failure events occur: [Assignment:
  organization-defined audit failure events requiring real-time alerts].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Alerts provide organizations with urgent messages. Real-time alerts provide
  these messages at information technology speed (i.e., the time from event
  detection to alert occurs in seconds or less).


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  response to audit processing failures; information system design
  documentation; security plan; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; records of notifications or real-time alerts when
  audit processing failures occur; information system audit records; other
  relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing real-time audit alerts
  when organization-defined audit failure events occur].

cci-definition: "001858: The information system provides a real-time alert in
  organization-defined real-time period to organization-defined personnel,
  roles, and/or locations when organization-defined audit failure events
  requiring real-time alerts occur."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  immediately provide a real-time alert to personnel, roles, and/or locations
  defined in AU-5 (2), CCI 1857 when all audit failure events requiring
  real-time alerts occur. DoD has defined the real-time period as immediate. DoD
  has defined the audit failure events as all. For information system components
  that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed
  must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 1858.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy

  2.) List of personnel who receive indications of organization-defined
  inappropriate or unusual activity
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configured the information system to immediately provide a
  real-time alert to personnel, roles, and/or locations defined in AU-5 (2), CCI
  1857 when all audit failure events requiring real-time alerts occur. DoD has
  defined the real-time period as immediate. DoD has defined the audit failure
  events as all. For information system components that have applicable STIGs or
  SRGs, the organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the
  components to ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has
  configured the information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and
  SRGs pertaining to CCI 1858.

test-results: "UDS warning and notifications are immediate once they are
  triggered. To meet the requirement of providing a warning when allocated audit
  record storage nears capacity, you can configure a threshold-based alert in
  your monitoring stack (e.g., Grafana + Loki) that checks repository
  utilization and triggers once it surpasses an organization-defined percentage.
  In Grafana, create an alert rule that queries storage metrics (or log volume
  usage) and compares them against your defined threshold (e.g., 75% of maximum
  capacity per DoD defined percentage). Then, use notification policies and
  contact points to route the alert to the appropriate personnel, roles, or
  locations (such as a security teamâs Mattermost channel or a compliance
  officerâs email) within the specified time period. This ensures the system
  automatically provides advance warning, giving staff adequate time to manage
  storage capacity and maintain audit record integrity."
