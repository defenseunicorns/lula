control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system provides the capability to sort and search audit
  records for events of interest based on the content of [Assignment:
  organization-defined audit fields within audit records].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Sorting and searching of audit records may be based upon the contents of audit
  record fields, for example: (i) date/time of events; (ii) user identifiers;
  (iii) Internet Protocol (IP) addresses involved in the event; (iv) type of
  event; or (v) event success/failure.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit reduction and report generation; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; audit reduction, review, analysis, and reporting tools; audit
  record criteria (fields) establishing events of interest; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit reduction and
  report generation responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Audit reduction and report generation capability].

cci: 1885
cci-definition: "001885: The organization defines the audit fields within audit
  records to be searched for events of interest by the information system."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed must define and document the audit
  fields within audit records to be searched for events of interest by the
  information system. DoD has determined that the audit fields are not
  appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy

  2.) Example of audit log report based on events of interest
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented audit fields to ensure the organization
  being inspected/assessed defines the audit fields within audit records to be
  searched for events of interest by the information system. DoD has determined
  that the audit fields are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

test-results: UDS provides robust audit log searching capabilities through its
  integrated logging and monitoring components (Vector, Loki, and Grafana).
  These tools allow administrators to define and execute targeted searches
  across critical audit fields, including timestamps, user identities, IP
  addresses, event types, actions performed, resource access, and authentication
  results. Logs collected by Vector and stored in Loki are fully indexed and
  searchable, enabling rapid identification and analysis of security events.
