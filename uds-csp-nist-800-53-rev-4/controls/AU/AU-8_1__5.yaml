control-acronym: AU-8(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system:

  (a) Compares the internal information system clocks [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] with [Assignment: organization-defined
  authoritative time source]; and

  (b) Synchronizes the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source
  when the time difference is greater than [Assignment: organization-defined
  time period].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement provides uniformity of time stamps for information
  systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  time stamp generation; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; information system

  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing internal information
  system clock synchronization].

cci-definition: "002046: The information system synchronizes the internal system
  clocks to the authoritative time source when the time difference is greater
  than the organization-defined time period."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  synchronize the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source when
  the time difference is greater than the time period defined in AU-8 (1), CCI
  1892.


  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 2046.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy

  2.) Example of how the information system synchronizes internal information
  system clocks at least hourly with a NIST Internet Time Service server
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the system synchronizes the internal system clocks to the
  authoritative time source when the time difference is greater than the time
  period defined in AU-8 (1), CCI 1892.


  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 2046.

test-results: UDS ensures precise synchronization of internal system clocks
  through Kubernetes infrastructure, which is configured to regularly
  synchronize with an authoritative time source using the Network Time Protocol
  (NTP). Kubernetes nodes, containers, and all associated UDS components
  maintain time synchronization by periodically (at intervals defined by the
  organization's policy) comparing and aligning their internal clocks with the
  organization's designated authoritative NTP servers. This synchronization
  ensures consistent and accurate timestamps across audit logs collected by
  Vector and stored in Loki, facilitating accurate event correlation and
  compliance auditing.
