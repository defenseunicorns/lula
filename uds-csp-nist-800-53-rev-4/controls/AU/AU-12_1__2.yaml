control-acronym: AU-12(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system compiles audit records from [Assignment:
  organization-defined information system components] into a system-wide
  (logical or physical) audit trail that is time-correlated to within
  [Assignment: organization-defined level of tolerance for relationship between
  time stamps of individual records in the audit trail].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit trails are time-correlated if the time stamps in the individual audit
  records can be reliably related to the time stamps in other audit records to
  achieve a time ordering of the records within organizational tolerances.
  Related controls: AU-8, AU-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit record generation; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; system-wide audit
  trail (logical or physical); information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit record generation
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing audit record generation
  capability].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  compile audit records from information system components defined in AU-12 (1),
  CCI 1577 into a system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail that is
  time-correlated to within the level of tolerance defined in AU-12 (1),
  CCI-000173 for relationship between time stamps of individual records in the
  audit trail.


  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 174.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment examines the information
  system to ensure the information system is configured to compile audit records
  from information system components defined in AU-12 (1), CCI 1577 into a
  system-wide (logical or physical) audit trail that is time-correlated to
  within the level of tolerance defined in AU-12 (1), CCI-000173 for
  relationship between time stamps of individual records in the audit trail.

  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 174.

test-results: UDS compiles comprehensive audit records from all critical
  information system components including Keycloak (identity management), Istio
  Service Mesh (network traffic and policy enforcement), NeuVector (container
  security), Kubernetes (system resource management), and infrastructure
  components into a centralized, unified audit trail. Logs from these components
  are securely collected and aggregated by Vector, centrally stored and indexed
  in Loki, and made searchable through Grafana dashboards. All logs are
  timestamped and synchronized via Network Time Protocol (NTP), ensuring
  accurate correlation of events across the system within very close tolerances.
