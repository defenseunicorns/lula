  Description:

  The information system provides a warning to [Assignment: organization-defined
  personnel, roles, and/or locations] within [Assignment: organization-defined
  time period] when allocated audit record storage volume reaches [Assignment:
  organization-defined percentage] of repository maximum audit record storage
  capacity.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizations may have multiple audit data storage repositories distributed
  across multiple information system components, with each repository having
  different storage volume capacities.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  response to audit processing failures; information system design
  documentation; security plan; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit and
  accountability responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing audit storage limit
  warnings].

  organization-defined personnel, roles, and/or locations within
  organization-defined time period when allocated audit record storage volume
  reaches organization-defined percentage of repository maximum audit record
  storage capacity."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  immediately provide a warning to personnel, roles, and/or locations defined in
  AU-5 (1), CCI 1852 when allocated audit record storage volume reaches 75
  percent of repository maximum audit record storage capacity. DoD has defined
  the time period as immediate. DoD has defined the percentage as 75 percent.
  For information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance
  that pertains to CCI 1855.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) List of personnel who receive indications of organization-defined
  inappropriate or unusual activity

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed has configured the information system to immediately
  provide a warning to personnel, roles, and/or locations defined in AU-5 (1),
  CCI 1852 when allocated audit record storage volume reaches 75 percent of
  repository maximum audit record storage capacity. DoD has defined the time
  period as immediate. DoD has defined the percentage as 75 percent. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 1855.

test-results: "UDS warning and notifications are immediate once they are
  triggered. To meet the requirement of providing a warning when allocated audit
  record storage nears capacity, you can configure a threshold-based alert in
  your monitoring stack (e.g., Grafana + Loki) that checks repository
  utilization and triggers once it surpasses an organization-defined percentage.
  In Grafana, create an alert rule that queries storage metrics (or log volume
  usage) and compares them against your defined threshold (e.g., 75% of maximum
  capacity per DoD defined percentage). Then, use notification policies and
  contact points to route the alert to the appropriate personnel, roles, or
  locations (such as a security teamâs Mattermost channel or a compliance
  officerâs email) within the specified time period. This ensures the system
  automatically provides advance warning, giving staff adequate time to manage
  storage capacity and maintain audit record integrity."
