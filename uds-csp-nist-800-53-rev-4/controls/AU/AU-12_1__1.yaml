control-acronym: AU-12(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system compiles audit records from [Assignment:
  organization-defined information system components] into a system-wide
  (logical or physical) audit trail that is time-correlated to within
  [Assignment: organization-defined level of tolerance for relationship between
  time stamps of individual records in the audit trail].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit trails are time-correlated if the time stamps in the individual audit
  records can be reliably related to the time stamps in other audit records to
  achieve a time ordering of the records within organizational tolerances.
  Related controls: AU-8, AU-12.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit record generation; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; system-wide audit
  trail (logical or physical); information system audit records; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit record generation
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing audit record generation
  capability].

cci: 173
cci-definition: "000173: The organization defines the level of tolerance for
  relationship between time stamps of individual records in the audit trail that
  will be used for correlation."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed will define and document their level
  of tolerance for variation in the time stamps applied to the audit data
  generated by the organization's information systems.


  DoD has determined that the level of tolerance is not appropriate to define at
  the Enterprise level.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: >-
  The organization conducting the inspection/assessment reviews the
  organization's audit and accountability policy and procedures addressing audit
  record generation and retention; information system audit configuration
  settings and associated documentation; information system audit records; and
  any other relevant documents or records. The objective is to validate the
  organization has defined and documented its level of tolerance for variation
  in the time stamps applied to the audit data generated by the organization's
  information systems.

  DoD has determined that the level of tolerance is not appropriate to define at
  the Enterprise level.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS inherently supports
  precise timestamp synchronization and correlation across audit records through
  Network Time Protocol (NTP) synchronization on Kubernetes clusters and
  associated system components, including Vector and Loki for audit logging.
  These components consistently record timestamps accurately, enabling
  correlation of audit events. However, explicitly defining and documenting the
  acceptable level of tolerance (e.g., seconds or milliseconds) between
  timestamps of individual audit records to facilitate accurate event
  correlation remains an organizational procedural responsibility. The
  organization deploying UDS must formally define and document this time
  tolerance within internal security policies or audit procedures to fully
  comply with this control.)
