control-acronym: AU-12
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system:

  a. Provides audit record generation capability for the auditable events
  defined in AU-2 a. at [Assignment: organization-defined information system
  components];

  b. Allows [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to select
  which auditable events are to be audited by specific components of the
  information system; and

  c. Generates audit records for the events defined in AU-2

  d. with the content defined in AU-3.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Audit records can be generated from many different information system
  components. The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits
  are to be generated. These events are typically a subset of all events for
  which the information system is capable of generating audit records. Related
  controls: AC-3, AU-2, AU-3, AU-6, AU-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit record generation; security plan; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; list of auditable events; information system audit records;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit record generation
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing audit record generation
  capability].

cci-definition: "000172: The information system generates audit records for the
  events defined in AU-2 d with the content defined in AU-3."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  generate audit records for the events defined in AU-2 d with the content
  defined in AU-3. For information system components that have applicable STIGs
  or SRGs, the organization being inspected/assessed must comply with the
  STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI 172.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy

  2.) List of information system components that provide audit record generation
  capability
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure that the system generates audit
  records for the events defined in AU-2 d with the content defined in AU-3. For
  information system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the
  organization conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to
  ensure that the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the
  information system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining
  to CCI 172.

test-results: UDS generates comprehensive audit records aligned with the event
  categories defined in AU-2(d), including successful and unsuccessful user
  authentication attempts, account management actions, access control decisions,
  administrative configuration changes, system startup/shutdown events, and
  other critical security events. These records contain all necessary content
  required by AU-3, such as timestamps, user identities, event descriptions,
  source and destination addresses, event outcomes, and associated system
  components. Specifically, detailed audit logs are captured through Vector,
  aggregated and securely stored in Loki, and made searchable through Grafana
  dashboards. Identity management via Keycloak, runtime protection via
  NeuVector, and infrastructure management provided by Kubernetes and Istio
  Service Mesh collectively ensure comprehensive and accurate audit log
  coverage, meeting the full intent of this control.
