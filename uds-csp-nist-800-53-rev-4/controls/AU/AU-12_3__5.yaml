control-acronym: AU-12(3)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system provides the capability for [Assignment:
  organization-defined individuals or roles] to change the auditing to be
  performed on [Assignment: organization-defined information system components]
  based on [Assignment: organization-defined selectable event criteria] within
  [Assignment: organization-defined time thresholds].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  This control enhancement enables organizations to extend or limit auditing as
  necessary to meet organizational requirements. Auditing that is limited to
  conserve information system resources may be extended to address certain
  threat situations. In addition, auditing may be limited to a specific set of
  events to facilitate audit reduction, analysis, and reporting. Organizations
  can establish time thresholds in which audit actions are changed, for example,
  near real-time, within minutes, or within hours. Related control: AU-7.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit record generation; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; system-generated
  list of individuals or roles authorized to change auditing to be performed;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit record generation
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing audit record generation
  capability].

cci-definition: "002047: The organization defines the information system
  components on which the auditing that is to be performed can be changed by
  organization-defined individuals or roles."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents the
  information system components on which the auditing that is to be performed
  can be changed by individuals or roles defined in AU-12 (3), CCI 1913. DoD has
  determined the information system components are not appropriate to define at
  the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy, referencing section
  which defines the information system components on which the auditing that is
  to be performed can be changed

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented information system components to ensure
  the organization being inspected/assessed has defined the information system
  components on which the auditing that is to be performed can be changed by the
  individuals or roles defined in AU-12 (3), CCI 1913. DoD has determined the
  information system components are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise
  level.

test-results: UDS allows auditing configurations to be dynamically adjusted by
  authorized roles or individuals through its integrated logging and monitoring
  components (Vector, Loki, and Grafana). Administrators can define and enforce
  access permissions via centralized identity management (Keycloak) and
  Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), specifying precisely which
  personnel or roles can alter auditing configurations. These authorized
  personnel can then modify audit settings on key components such as Kubernetes
  clusters, Istio Service Mesh, Keycloak identity services, and NeuVector
  security monitoring tools.
