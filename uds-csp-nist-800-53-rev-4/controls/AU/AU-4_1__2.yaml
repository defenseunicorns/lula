control-information: >-
  Description:

  The information system off-loads audit records [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] onto a different system or media than the
  system being audited.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Off-loading is a process designed to preserve the confidentiality and
  integrity of audit records by moving the records from the primary information
  system to a secondary or alternate system. It is a common process in
  information systems with limited audit storage capacity; the audit storage is
  used only in a transitory fashion until the system can communicate with the
  secondary or alternate system designated for storing the audit records, at
  which point the information is transferred.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  audit storage capacity; procedures addressing transfer of information system
  audit records to secondary or alternate systems; information system design
  documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
  documentation; logs of audit record transfers to secondary or alternate
  systems; information system audit records transferred to secondary or
  alternate systems; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with audit storage capacity
  planning responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting transfer of audit records
  onto a different system].

cci: 1851
cci-definition: "001851: The information system off-loads audit records per
  organization-defined frequency onto a different system or media than the
  system being audited."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  off-load audit records at a minimum, in real-time for interconnected systems
  and weekly for stand-alone systems onto a different system or media than the
  system being audited. DoD has defined the frequency as at a minimum, real-time
  for interconnected systems and weekly for stand-alone systems. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  1851.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated audit and accountability policy

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed has configured the information system to off-load audit
  records at a minimum, in real-time for interconnected systems and weekly for
  stand-alone systems onto a different system or media than the system being
  audited. DoD has defined the frequency as at a minimum, real-time for
  interconnected systems and weekly for stand-alone systems. For information
  system components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization
  conducting the inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that
  the organization being inspected/assessed has configured the information
  system in compliance with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI
  1851.
