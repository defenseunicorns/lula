  Description:

  The information system provides the capability for authorized users to
  remotely view/hear all content related to an established user session in real
  time.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing
  user session auditing; information system design documentation; information
  system configuration settings and associated documentation; information system
  audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities; system/network administrators; system developers].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms implementing user session auditing
  capability].

cci-definition: "001920: The information system provides the capability for
  authorized users to remotely view/hear all content related to an established
  user session in real time."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed configures the information system to
  provide the capability for authorized users to remotely view/hear all content
  related to an established user session in real time. For information system
  components that have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization being
  inspected/assessed must comply with the STIG/SRG guidance that pertains to CCI
  1920.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) List of privileged users who will be authorized remote access to manage
  user sessions in real time

  2.) Applicable STIG/SRG checks
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  examines the information system to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed configures the information system to provide the capability
  for authorized users to remotely view/hear all content related to an
  established user session in real time. For information system components that
  have applicable STIGs or SRGs, the organization conducting the
  inspection/assessment evaluates the components to ensure that the organization
  being inspected/assessed has configured the information system in compliance
  with the applicable STIGs and SRGs pertaining to CCI 1920.

test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS itself does not
  inherently provide or support remote, real-time viewing or listening to user
  session content (e.g., session mirroring, remote desktop viewing, or real-time
  session monitoring). Such functionality, if required, would typically be
  provided by specialized endpoint monitoring or auditing tools external to the
  UDS environment. Therefore, this control is considered not applicable directly
  to the UDS platform.)
