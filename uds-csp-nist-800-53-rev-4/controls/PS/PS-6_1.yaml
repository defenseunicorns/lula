  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Develops and documents access agreements for organizational information
  systems;

  b. Reviews and updates the access agreements [Assignment: organization-defined
  frequency]; and

  c. Ensures that individuals requiring access to organizational information and
  information systems:

  1. Sign appropriate access agreements prior to being granted access; and

  2. Re-sign access agreements to maintain access to organizational information
  systems when access agreements have been updated or [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Access agreements include, for example, nondisclosure agreements, acceptable
  use agreements, rules of behavior, and conflict-of-interest agreements. Signed
  access agreements include an acknowledgement that individuals have read,
  understand, and agree to abide by the constraints associated with
  organizational information systems to which access is authorized.
  Organizations can use electronic signatures to acknowledge access agreements
  unless specifically prohibited by organizational policy. Related control:
  PL-4, PS-2, PS-3, PS-4, PS-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Personnel security policy; procedures addressing access
  agreements for organizational information and information systems; security
  plan; access agreements; records of access agreement reviews and updates;
  other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with personnel security
  responsibilities; organizational personnel who have signed/resigned access
  agreements; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for access agreements; automated
  mechanisms supporting access agreements].
