control-acronym: PS-3(3)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization ensures that individuals accessing an information system
  processing, storing, or transmitting information requiring special protection:

  (a) Have valid access authorizations that are demonstrated by assigned
  official government duties; and

  (b) Satisfy [Assignment: organization-defined additional personnel screening
  criteria].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Organizational information requiring special protection includes, for example,
  Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and Sources and Methods Information
  (SAMI). Personnel security criteria include, for example, position sensitivity
  background screening requirements.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Personnel security policy; access control policy,
  procedures addressing personnel screening; records of screened personnel;
  screening criteria; records of access authorizations; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with personnel security
  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for ensuring valid access
  authorizations for information requiring special protection; organizational
  process for additional personnel screening for information requiring special
  protection].

  criteria."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed documents and implements a process
  to ensure that individuals accessing an information system processing,
  storing, or transmitting information requiring special protection satisfy
  additional personnel screening criteria defined in PS-3 (3), CCI 3021.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) SOP/TTP process implementation documentation for individuals accessing an
  information system processing, storing, or transmitting information requiring
  special protection satisfies additional personnel screening criteria defined
  in PS-3 (3), CCI 3021.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented process to ensure the organization being
  inspected/assessed implements a process to ensure that individuals accessing
  an information system processing, storing, or transmitting information
  requiring special protection satisfy additional personnel screening criteria
  defined in PS-3 (3), CCI 3021.
