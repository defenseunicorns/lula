control-acronym: PS-3
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Screens individuals prior to authorizing access to the information system;
  and

  b. Rescreens individuals according to [Assignment: organization-defined
  conditions requiring rescreening and, where rescreening is so indicated, the
  frequency of such rescreening].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Personnel screening and rescreening activities reflect applicable federal
  laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
  guidance, and specific criteria established for the risk designations of
  assigned positions. Organizations may define different rescreening conditions
  and frequencies for personnel accessing information systems based on types of
  information processed, stored, or transmitted by the systems. Related
  controls: AC-2, IA-4, PE-2, PS-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

cci-definition: "001517: The organization rescreens individuals with authorized
  access to the information system according to organization-defined conditions
  requiring rescreening, and where rescreening is so indicated, the
  organization-defined frequency of such rescreening."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The information system owner will rescreen individuals according to system
  owner defined list of conditions requiring rescreening (CCI-001518)
  individuals for access to the information system and frequency (CCI - 001519)
  of such rescreening. Rescreening actions will be maintained as an audit trail
  (AU-2).

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Audit records of rescreening actions.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines audit records of rescreening actions to ensure the system
  owner is rescreening individuals according to a system owner-defined list of
  conditions requiring rescreening and, where re-screening is so indicated,
  based on the system owner-defined frequency of such rescreening.
