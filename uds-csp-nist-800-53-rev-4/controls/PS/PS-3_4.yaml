control-acronym: PS-3
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Screens individuals prior to authorizing access to the information system;
  and

  b. Rescreens individuals according to [Assignment: organization-defined
  conditions requiring rescreening and, where rescreening is so indicated, the
  frequency of such rescreening].


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Personnel screening and rescreening activities reflect applicable federal
  laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards,
  guidance, and specific criteria established for the risk designations of
  assigned positions. Organizations may define different rescreening conditions
  and frequencies for personnel accessing information systems based on types of
  information processed, stored, or transmitted by the systems. Related
  controls: AC-2, IA-4, PE-2, PS-2.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  personnel screening; records of screened personnel; security plan; other
  relevant documents or records].

  responsibilities; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].

cci-definition: "001519: The organization defines the frequency for rescreening
  individuals with authorized access to the information system when
  organization-defined conditions requiring rescreening are met."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The information system owner will define and document the required frequency
  of rescreening for access to the information system. DoD has determined the
  frequency is not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) SOP/TTP documentation of required frequency for rescreening individuals
  for access the system.
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documentation defining the required frequency for
  rescreening individuals for access to the system. DoD has determined the
  frequency is not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
