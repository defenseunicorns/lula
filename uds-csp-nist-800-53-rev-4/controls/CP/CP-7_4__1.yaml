  Description:

  The organization prepares the alternate processing site so that the site is
  ready to be used as the operational site supporting essential missions and
  business functions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Site preparation includes, for example, establishing configuration settings
  for information system components at the alternate processing site consistent
  with the requirements for such settings at the primary site and ensuring that
  essential supplies and other logistical considerations are in place. Related
  controls: CM-2, CM-6.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  alternate processing sites; contingency plan; alternate processing site;
  alternate processing site agreements; alternate processing site
  configurations; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency plan
  alternate processing site responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information system recovery responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  recovery at the alternate processing site].
