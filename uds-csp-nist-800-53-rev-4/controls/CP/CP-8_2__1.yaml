control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization obtains alternate telecommunications services to reduce the
  likelihood of sharing a single point of failure with primary
  telecommunications services.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  primary and alternate telecommunications services; contingency plan; primary
  and alternate telecommunications service agreements; other relevant documents
  or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency plan
  telecommunications responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  system recovery responsibilities; primary and alternate telecommunications
  service providers; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP
  Moderate Baseline, Rev 4

  The organization being inspected/assessed obtains alternate telecommunications
  services to reduce the likelihood of sharing a single point of failure with
  primary telecommunications services IAW DoDI 8100.04.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated contingency plan, referencing telecommunications section

  2.) Cable diagrams

  3.) Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with telecommunications services
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines agreements with their service providers to ensure that a
  single point of failure is not shared.
