control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Tests the contingency plan for the information system [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] using [Assignment: organization-defined tests]
  to determine the effectiveness of the plan and the organizational readiness to
  execute the plan;

  b. Reviews the contingency plan test results; and

  c. Initiates corrective actions, if needed.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Methods for testing contingency plans to determine the effectiveness of the
  plans and to identify potential weaknesses in the plans include, for example,
  walk-through and tabletop exercises, checklists, simulations (parallel, full
  interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. Organizations conduct testing based
  on the continuity requirements in contingency plans and include a
  determination of the effects on organizational operations, assets, and
  individuals arising due to contingency operations. Organizations have
  flexibility and discretion in the breadth, depth, and timelines of corrective
  actions. Related controls: CP-2, CP-3, IR-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  contingency plan testing; contingency plan; security plan; contingency plan
  test documentation; contingency plan test results; other relevant documents or

  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  contingency plan testing, reviewing or responding to contingency plan tests;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for contingency plan testing;
  automated mechanisms supporting the contingency plan and/or contingency plan
  testing].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed defines and documents contingency
  plan tests to be conducted for the information system. DoD has determined the
  contingency plan tests are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation that defines contingency plan tests to be conducted
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the documented contingency plan tests to ensure the
  organization being inspected/assessed defines contingency plan tests to be
  conducted for the information system. DoD has determined the contingency plan
  tests are not appropriate to define at the Enterprise level.
