control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization protects backup and restoration hardware, firmware, and
  software.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Protection of backup and restoration hardware, firmware, and software
  components includes both physical and technical safeguards. Backup and
  restoration software includes, for example, router tables, compilers, and
  other security-relevant system software. Related controls: AC-3, AC-6, PE-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  information system recovery and reconstitution; contingency plan; information
  system design documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; logical access credentials; physical access
  credentials; logical access authorization records; physical access
  authorization records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with information system
  recovery and reconstitution responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for protecting backup and
  restoration hardware, firmware, and software; automated mechanisms supporting
  and/or implementing protection of backup and restoration hardware, firmware,
  and software].

  and back up procedures designed to protect its backup and restoration
  firmware.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documented proof that secondary site exists for operation in the event of
  a crisis
