control-acronym: CP-6(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization identifies an alternate storage site that is separated from
  the primary storage site to reduce susceptibility to the same threats.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Threats that affect alternate storage sites are typically defined in
  organizational assessments of risk and include, for example, natural
  disasters, structural failures, hostile cyber attacks, and errors of
  omission/commission. Organizations determine what is considered a sufficient
  degree of separation between primary and alternate storage sites based on the
  types of threats that are of concern. For one particular type of threat (i.e.,
  hostile cyber attack), the degree of separation between sites is less
  relevant. Related control: RA-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  alternate storage sites; contingency plan; alternate storage site; alternate
  storage site agreements; primary storage site agreements; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency plan
  alternate storage site responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information system recovery responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].


  Justification to Select: 


  Added by [r4] DoD Level 5 - FedRAMP HBL / FedRAMP+ Overlay: Included in the
  FedRAMP HIGH Baseline, and included in CNSSI 1253 MMM.


  FedRAMP HIGH PA accepted for Level 5 with additional FedRAMP+ C/CE assessment.


  CNSSI 1253 MMM does not apply to commercial off-premises CSPs/CSOs.


  FedRAMP Justification: Included in NIST High Baseline, Rev 4 and FedRAMP
  Moderate Baseline, Rev 4

control-implementation-narrative: >-
  Customers can leverage multi-availability zone infrastructure and cross-region
  replication for services that support it to address alternate storage site
  controls if required by their organization.


  This control may be inheritable if customers choose an AWS region as an
  alternate storage site. However, if part of any system that is being created
  has components outside of AWS where this control applies, it is not
  inheritable....

cci: 507
cci-definition: "000507: The organization identifies an alternate storage site
  that is separated from the primary storage site to reduce susceptibility to
  the same threats."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed identifies and documents within the
  contingency plan an alternate storage site not susceptible to the same threats
  that exist at the primary storage site. The organization must document threats
  in the risk management strategy IAW PM-9, CCI 000227.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Risk management strategy

  2.) Contingency plan that identifies an alternate storage site that is
  separated from the primary storage
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the risk management strategy and the contingency plan to
  ensure the organization identifies an alternate storage site that is separated
  from the primary storage site so as not to be susceptible to the same threats
  identified at the primary site.
