control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization identifies potential accessibility problems to the alternate
  storage site in the event of an area-wide disruption or disaster and outlines
  explicit mitigation actions.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Area-wide disruptions refer to those types of disruptions that are broad in
  geographic scope (e.g., hurricane, regional power outage) with such
  determinations made by organizations based on organizational assessments of
  risk. Explicit mitigation actions include, for example: (i) duplicating backup
  information at other alternate storage sites if access problems occur at
  originally designated alternate sites; or (ii) planning for physical access to
  retrieve backup information if electronic accessibility to the alternate site
  is disrupted. Related control: RA-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  alternate storage sites; contingency plan; alternate storage site; list of
  potential accessibility problems to alternate storage site; mitigation actions
  for accessibility problems to alternate storage site; organizational risk
  assessments; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency plan
  alternate storage site responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information system recovery responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  information security responsibilities].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed must identify and document in the
  contingency plan explicit mitigation actions for accessibility problems
  identified in CP-6 (3), CCI 509 to the alternate storage site in the event of
  an area-wide disruption or disaster.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Contingency plan, which includes documented explicit mitigation actions
  for accessibility problems identified in CP-6 (3), CCI 509 to the alternate
  storage site
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the contingency plan to ensure the organization has
  documented explicit mitigation actions for accessibility problems identified
  in CP-6 (3), CCI 509 to the alternate storage site in the event of an
  area-wide disruption or disaster.

  backups offsite via Velero if configured, but selection and preparation of an
  alternate site is organizational.)"
