control-acronym: CP-4(1)
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization coordinates contingency plan testing with organizational
  elements responsible for related plans.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Plans related to contingency plans for organizational information systems
  include, for example, Business Continuity Plans, Disaster Recovery Plans,
  Continuity of Operations Plans, Crisis Communications Plans, Critical
  Infrastructure Plans, Cyber Incident Response Plans, and Occupant Emergency
  Plans. This control enhancement does not require organizations to create
  organizational elements to handle related plans or to align such elements with
  specific plans. It does require, however, that if such organizational elements
  are responsible for related plans, organizations should coordinate with those
  elements. Related controls: IR-8, PM-8.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; incident response policy;
  procedures addressing contingency plan testing; contingency plan testing
  documentation; contingency plan; business continuity plans; disaster recovery
  plans; continuity of operations plans; crisis communications plans; critical
  infrastructure plans; cyber incident response plans; occupant emergency plans;
  security plan; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency plan
  testing responsibilities; organizational personnel; personnel with
  responsibilities for related plans; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].

  with organizational elements responsible for related plans."
implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed coordinates the testing of its
  contingency plan with other organizational elements responsible for related
  plans. The organization documents any applicable agreements with responsible
  internal or external entities. For external entities the agreements could
  entail MOUs, MOAs, SLAs or contracts.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Documentation (MOU/MOA) of agreements with entities responsible for the
  contingency or related plans
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines documentation of agreements with entities responsible for
  the contingency or related plans to ensure there is evidence of coordination
  of those tests.
