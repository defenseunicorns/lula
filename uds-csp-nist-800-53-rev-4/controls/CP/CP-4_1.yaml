control-acronym: CP-4
control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Tests the contingency plan for the information system [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency] using [Assignment: organization-defined tests]
  to determine the effectiveness of the plan and the organizational readiness to
  execute the plan;

  b. Reviews the contingency plan test results; and

  c. Initiates corrective actions, if needed.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Methods for testing contingency plans to determine the effectiveness of the
  plans and to identify potential weaknesses in the plans include, for example,
  walk-through and tabletop exercises, checklists, simulations (parallel, full
  interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. Organizations conduct testing based
  on the continuity requirements in contingency plans and include a
  determination of the effects on organizational operations, assets, and
  individuals arising due to contingency operations. Organizations have
  flexibility and discretion in the breadth, depth, and timelines of corrective
  actions. Related controls: CP-2, CP-3, IR-3.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  contingency plan testing; contingency plan; security plan; contingency plan
  test documentation; contingency plan test results; other relevant documents or
  records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibilities for
  contingency plan testing, reviewing or responding to contingency plan tests;
  organizational personnel with information security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for contingency plan testing;
  automated mechanisms supporting the contingency plan and/or contingency plan
  testing].
