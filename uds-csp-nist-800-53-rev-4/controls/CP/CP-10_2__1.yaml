  Description:

  The information system implements transaction recovery for systems that are
  transaction-based.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Transaction-based information systems include, for example, database
  management systems and transaction processing systems. Mechanisms supporting
  transaction recovery include, for example, transaction rollback and
  transaction journaling.


  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  information system recovery and reconstitution; contingency plan; information
  system design documentation; information system configuration settings and
  associated documentation; contingency plan test documentation; contingency
  plan test results; information system transaction recovery records;
  information system audit records; other relevant documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with responsibility for
  transaction recovery; organizational personnel with information security
  responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Automated mechanisms supporting and/or implementing
  transaction recovery capability].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed identifies, documents, and
  implements transaction recovery capability for systems that are
  transaction-based. The organization must document transaction recovery results
  as part of contingency plan testing.

  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) Signed and dated contingency plan, referencing transaction recovery
  section
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the contingency plan test results to verify transaction
  recovery.
inherited: Local
remote-inheritance-instance: "-"
test-results: Not Applicable to UDS technology stack. (UDS is primarily a
  containerized DevSecOps deployment environment and infrastructure management
  solution. It does not inherently implement or manage transactional database
  operations or other transactional processing systems requiring explicit
  transaction recovery mechanisms. Transaction recovery, if required, would
  typically be addressed at the individual application or database component
  level, outside the core functionality provided by UDS itself.)
