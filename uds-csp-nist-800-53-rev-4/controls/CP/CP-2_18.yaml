control-information: >-
  Description:

  The organization:

  a. Develops a contingency plan for the information system that:

  1. Identifies essential missions and business functions and associated
  contingency requirements;

  2. Provides recovery objectives, restoration priorities, and metrics;

  3. Addresses contingency roles, responsibilities, assigned individuals with
  contact information;

  4. Addresses maintaining essential missions and business functions despite an
  information system disruption, compromise, or failure;

  5. Addresses eventual, full information system restoration without
  deterioration of the security safeguards originally planned and implemented;
  and

  6. Is reviewed and approved by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or
  roles];

  b. Distributes copies of the contingency plan to [Assignment:
  organization-defined key contingency personnel (identified by name and/or by
  role) and organizational elements];

  c. Coordinates contingency planning activities with incident handling
  activities;

  d. Reviews the contingency plan for the information system [Assignment:
  organization-defined frequency];

  e. Updates the contingency plan to address changes to the organization,
  information system, or environment of operation and problems encountered
  during contingency plan implementation, execution, or testing;

  f. Communicates contingency plan changes to [Assignment: organization-defined
  key contingency personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and
  organizational elements]; and

  g. Protects the contingency plan from unauthorized disclosure and
  modification.


  Supplemental Guidance:

  Contingency planning for information systems is part of an overall
  organizational program for achieving continuity of operations for
  mission/business functions. Contingency planning addresses both information
  system restoration and implementation of alternative mission/business
  processes when systems are compromised. The effectiveness of contingency
  planning is maximized by considering such planning throughout the phases of
  the system development life cycle. Performing contingency planning on
  hardware, software, and firmware development can be an effective means of
  achieving information system resiliency. Contingency plans reflect the degree
  of restoration required for organizational information systems since not all
  systems may need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of
  operations desired. Information system recovery objectives reflect applicable
  laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, regulations, and
  guidelines. In addition to information system availability, contingency plans
  also address other security-related events resulting in a reduction in mission
  and/or business effectiveness, such as malicious attacks compromising the
  confidentiality or integrity of information systems. Actions addressed in
  contingency plans include, for example, orderly/graceful degradation,
  information system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate information
  flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are under attack. By
  closely coordinating contingency planning with incident handling activities,
  organizations can ensure that the necessary contingency planning activities
  are in place and activated in the event of a security incident. Related

  Potential Assessment Methods and Objectives:

  The below information from the NIST SP 800-53 Revision 4 Security Catalog is
  intended to provide additional optional mechanisms to take into account when
  reviewing this Security Control. Assessments of the individual security
  requirements must still include a response to the specific procedures/guidance
  stated in the correlated Assessment Procedures.

  Examine: [SELECT FROM: Contingency planning policy; procedures addressing
  contingency operations for the information system; contingency plan; security
  plan; evidence of contingency plan reviews and updates; other relevant
  documents or records].


  Interview: [SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel with contingency planning
  and plan implementation responsibilities; organizational personnel with
  incident handling responsibilities; organizational personnel with information
  security responsibilities].


  Test: [SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for contingency plan development,
  review, update, and protection; automated mechanisms for developing,
  reviewing, updating and/or protecting the contingency plan].

implementation-guidance: >-
  The organization being inspected/assessed ensures the contingency plan is
  disseminated to all stakeholders identified in the contingency plan via an
  information sharing capability.


  DoD has defined the list as all stakeholders identified in the contingency
  plan.


  Recommended Compelling Evidence:

  1.) List of key contingency personnel, who receive the contingency plan
assessment-procedures: The organization conducting the inspection/assessment
  obtains and examines the contingency plan via the inspected organization's
  information sharing capability (e.g. portal, intranet, email, etc.) to ensure
  it has been disseminated.
