# Notes

## Foundation
- Golang OSCAL support for models/types
    - OSCAL developers recommend generation of the Go Types from metaschema as the most maintainable solution
        - [Example](https://github.com/GoComply/metaschema)
        - There will be a learning curve involved here. Not insurmountable, but will require time.
    - Second option is to follow other tooling such as [Compliance-Trestle](https://github.com/IBM/compliance-trestle)
        - Generate model types from a released NIST JSON Schema
        - This may provide a good first iteration with the smallest amount of work required to get usable types
            - un-blocks implementations that would benefit from consuming this as a module
        - Should be located in an independent repository for maintenance purposes
            - Would provide a iterative location should the work be converted to use metaschema instead of OSCAL JSON schema

- Understanding (and documenting) the full end-to-end intent for compliance
    - The relationship between components and platforms (and how an end-user would leverage component models for an SSP)
    - The value that a single application (optimally open source) could benefit by collaborating/producing OSCAL
    - The value to end-users for inheritable controls with continuous-compliance validation
    - the value to GRC tooling for integration (see more below)

- Understanding the ecosystem
    - How might tools want to integrate with Lula for leveraging functionality in application-specific use cases
        - gRPC being an integration path for validation without orchestration
    - There are spaces with which Lula should not look to compete - IE policy enforcement engines
        - But there is a lot of alignment opportunity - how?
    - Plugin architecture
        - May cross with the mention of gRPC above
        - Can we optimize to allow the data to get where it needs
            - GRC Tooling will allow relationships to be established between models (if present)
            - Other tools might want to send an OSCAL (or other) payload to be validated with results returned for some catered user experience.

- How to validate configurations
    - We know kubernetes orchestration is declarative-in-nature and that expected configuration can be validated against actual configuration via the API-server
    - Overlap between compliance and policy is quite heavy - leveraging policy to perform compliance-validation potentially improves both
        - Leveraging a policy engine to perform configuration queries provides an interfacing language (rego etc) to utilize in OSCAL validation rules

## Extension
- Existence of the tool/resource(s)
    - Can we fix this issue in the Kyverno CLI?
    - Or do we provide a different layer for providing this validation?

## Kyverno

### Limitations
- Wildcard for match any "kind" does not work as specified
- Cannot correlate between multiple resources well
    - Example: Given global context - cannot verify that all namespaces include a particular resource (CRD existence may be important)
    - Review the use of [External Data Sources](https://kyverno.io/docs/writing-policies/external-data-sources/) through the CLI
        - There are known issues here - but if resolvable could provide a mechanism for reporting on the existence of a resource
        - This would also allow establishing 1 -> Many relationships among resources
